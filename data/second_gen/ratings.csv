1,34741506,"The utility of Conversation Analysis versus Roter's Interaction Analysis System for studying communication in pharmacy settings: a scoping review. OBJECTIVES To compare the usefulness of the Roter Interaction Analysis System with Conversation Analysis (CA) for studying dynamic patient-pharmacist interactions within pharmacy practice. A scoping review was undertaken to identify all studies using Roter's method or CA to investigate patient-pharmacist interactions. The studies were then compared and contrasted for their methodological advantages and disadvantages. KEY FINDINGS In total, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria. Roter's method is effective in briefly describing patient-pharmacist interactions and can be used to measure the effect of training courses without consuming too much time. CA, although a time-consuming undertaking, looks at very specific features and the sequence of conversations including the dynamics of two-way interactions and can therefore be used to identify the source of conflict or misunderstandings. A flowchart showing the usefulness of both methods is suggested to help other researchers select the appropriate method(s) for their own research. SUMMARY Although both methods are effective for investigating patient-pharmacist interactions independently, using them sequentially could enable researchers to firstly identify how to make improvements (via CA), design relevant training and then investigate the impact of such training (via Roter's method) to enrich communications research.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

3,34742275,"The utilization of simulated patients for teaching and learning in the pharmacy curriculum: exploring pharmacy students' and recent alumni's perceptions using mixed-methods approach. BACKGROUND The use of simulated patients (SPs) is considered a significant resource for teaching and assessing clinical and communication skills in health professional education. We conducted this study to explore pharmacy students' perspective towards the utilization of SPs in Qatar and to identify areas that require improvement. METHODS An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used among students and recent graduates of the College of Pharmacy at Qatar University (QU-CPH). First, their perspectives toward the current utilization of SPs at QU-CPH was explored using a quantitative cross-sectional study design. Following this, we conducted six focus group discussions based on the analysis of the questionnaire results. The findings of the two phases were interpreted through integration of the quantitative and qualitative phases. RESULTS The majority of the participants (> 90%) reported that interactions with SPs are important in building good communication and counseling skills during professional skills course activities. Similarly, most of the respondents (80%) indicated that interactions with SPs prepared them to apply the clinical skills gained during professional skills and patient assessment sessions in real-life. In addition, they reported that interactions with SPs during competency-based assessments were good experiences. The participants disagreed with the notion that interaction with SPs of opposite gender was uncomfortable for them. Themes identified from the focus groups include: interactions with trained SPs compared to faculty SPs, standardization and consistency of SPs' roles, communication and language barriers, simulations of real-life case scenarios, SPs' competence and preparedness, psychological impact associated with interaction with SPs, proposed strategies for improving the SP program. Identified areas for improvement include the need for strengthening the SP training and orientation program as well as the SP selection criteria. CONCLUSION This study showed a positive impact of the utilization of SPs in this pharmacy curriculum as perceived by students and alumni. However, the SP program needs to be optimized in terms of the training and orientation of SPs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
4,34742494,"Implementing an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in the Intensive Care Unit by Engaging Critical Care Nurses.  The continuing rise in the incidence of multidrug-resistant organism infections has made combating this grave threat a national imperative. One of the most potent weapons in our arsenal against such organisms is the prudent use of antibiotics. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs aim to slow the development of antimicrobial resistance through judicious, monitored use of antibiotics. Traditionally, AMS programs have included pharmacists and physicians with training in AWS, infectious disease physicians, hospital leadership, microbiologists, and infection prevention professionals. Nurses are missing from AMS programs, especially intensive care nurses. Critical care nurses provide the majority of patient care to ICU patients and monitor the progress of the patient's condition. The ICU nurse is an obvious asset to the AMS programs. ICU nurses are well-educated autonomous professionals with a unique role in coordinating with the critical care team. Critical care nurses already perform numerous nursing tasks with AWS functions. This, together with their unique perspective makes them a valuable asset that has often been overlooked. Traditionally, perceived barriers have kept ICU nurses from joining AMS teams. By removing these barriers and engaging critical care nurses in the important work of AWS, we can strengthen our AMS team and achieve optimal outcomes for our patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
5,34742654,"Exploration of pharmacist comfort with harm reduction behaviors: Cross-sectional latent class analysis. BACKGROUND Pharmacists are positioned to play important roles in implementing evidence-based prevention and harm reduction approaches for opioid misuse and related health care outcomes such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C. More research is needed to understand how best to facilitate harm reduction practices among pharmacists. OBJECTIVES This hypothesis-generating study investigated (1) whether subgroups (latent classes) were observable among pharmacists based on self-reported comfort with specific harm reduction behaviors, (2) whether having reported expertise in key content areas was associated with any latent classes that might be identified, and (3) whether comfort and training were associated with actually having dispensed syringes for likely nonprescription drug use. METHODS This was a statewide census of community managing pharmacists in Arizona conducted from December 2018 to May 2019. Participants reported their degree of comfort with 10 harm reduction behaviors, their expertise (e.g., recent continuing pharmacy education or specialization) in selected content areas, and their syringe dispensing behavior. Additional sociodemographic information was also collected. Subgroups related to harm reduction were computed using latent class analysis, and associations between study variables were assessed using the Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS Data suggested the existence of 4 latent, comfort-based harm reduction classes: high comfort, moderate comfort, and clinical comfort, and opioid prevention only. Reported expertise in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV was likely associated with harm reduction class. However, class membership was not associated with reporting having dispensed nonprescription syringes, although the single comfort item for syringe dispensing, by itself, was associated therewith. CONCLUSION Comfort with harm reduction likely clusters, so pharmacists may be broadly comfortable with topics or methods of harm reduction; however, comfort with a specific harm reduction pharmacy practice may be a better predictor of engaging in that behavior than harm reduction comfort class. In contrast, strategies to improve comfort, such as intervention development, might successfully be informed by pharmacists' latent class.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
6,34743170,"Challenges for Polish Community Pharmacists in Provision of Services to Immigrants and Non-Polish-Speakers in 2018.  BACKGROUND International patient services in community pharmacies are becoming increasingly common. The growing number of immigrants, as well as the developing trend of medical tourism, make it necessary to provide these people with access to healthcare services, including pharmaceutical services in generally accessible pharmacies. Serving non-Polish-speaking patients, however, requires both fluent specialist knowledge of a foreign language and interpersonal skills. These skills can greatly influence the proper use of medications by patients. This study aimed to investigate the reported challenges for Polish community pharmacists in the provision of services to immigrants and non-Polish-speakers in 2018. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 98 pharmacists and pharmaceutical technicians from community pharmacies in Poland. The research tool was a questionnaire sent to pharmacy staff in cooperation with pharmacy councils in 2018. RESULTS Analysis of the data gathered using a 5-point Likert scale showed that the participants rated the preparedness for international patient services in pharmacies as medium (mean 2.76±1.33). The mean foreign language knowledge score was 2.99±1.29. The participants indicated a low possibility of acquiring these language skills (mean 2.53±0.91), and emphasized that patients from abroad rarely asked about the use of the medications (mean=2.20±1.06). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that in 2018, pharmacy staff in Poland did not feel adequately prepared to provide comprehensive pharmacy services for immigrants and non-Polish-speakers, with concerns of non-compliance with medications due to poor communication.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
7,34744443,"Pharmacists' Perceptions of Handling Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR): A Case Study in Saudi Arabia. Introduction Saudi Arabia is one of the countries facing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The pharmacist is an important stakeholder in the healthcare system who plays a crucial role in avoiding AMR and implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). Methods A cross-sectional design was used in this study. The online questionnaire collected data regarding the enablers that have helped in preparing pharmacists to handle AMR and the barriers faced by pharmacy personnel in handling AMR, as well as the strategies used to overcome the identified barriers. Results A total of 109 participants were included in the study. Just under two thirds (62.4%) of participants were female and the majority (70.6%) worked as pharmacists. Just under half (41.7%) had between 6 and 10 years of work experience. Three quarters (74.3%) had antimicrobial stewardship in place and around the same number (73.4%) were involved in handling infectious disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists have found that preparatory items/tasks, pharmacy college curriculum, pharmacy rotation, years of experience and self-education related to AMR handling to be natural, with a mean of 3.2. The participants found all the barriers - insufficient background, in site education and training, limited time, limited CPD activities, limited educational tools and no free access to relevant clinical journals - to be relevant, with a mean of 4.05. The participants found all the enablers - CPD activities, funded educational programs, allowing time for self-education, accessible educational resources and tools, annual evolution of competencies - to be relevant, with a mean of 4.12. Conclusion The study concluded that the barriers preventing the handling of AMR could be overcome through allowing pharmacists more time for self-directed continuous education, providing access to tools and online educational resources, and offering pharmacists funded courses to equip them with the knowledge, skills and competencies needed to handle AMR.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
8,34744736,"Metabolic Activation of the Toxic Natural Products From Herbal and Dietary Supplements Leading to Toxicities.  Currently, herbal and dietary supplements have been widely applied to prevent and treat various diseases. However, the potential toxicities and adverse reactions of herbal and dietary supplements have been increasingly reported, and have gradually attracted widespread attention from clinical pharmacists and physicians. Metabolic activation of specific natural products from herbal and dietary supplements is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 or intestinal bacteria, and generates chemical reactive/toxic metabolites that bind to cellular reduced glutathione or macromolecules, and form reactive metabolites-glutathione/protein/DNA adducts, and these protein/DNA adducts can result in toxicities. The present review focuses on the relation between metabolic activation and toxicities of natural products, and provides updated, comprehensive and critical comment on the toxic mechanisms of reactive metabolites. The key inductive role of metabolic activation in toxicity is highlighted, and frequently toxic functional groups of toxic natural products were summarized. The biotransformation of drug cytochrome P450 or intestinal bacteria involved in metabolic activation were clarified, the reactive metabolites-protein adducts were selected as biomarkers for predicting toxicity. And finally, further perspectives between metabolic activation and toxicities of natural products from herbal and dietary supplements are discussed, to provide a reference for the reasonable and safe usage of herbal and dietary supplements.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
9,34745204,"Development and Implementation of In-House Pharmacogenomic Testing Program at a Major Academic Health System.  Pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies how a person's genes affect the response to medications and is quickly becoming a significant part of precision medicine. The clinical application of PGx principles has consistently been cited as a major opportunity for improving therapeutic outcomes. Several recent studies have demonstrated that most individuals (> 90%) harbor PGx variants that would be clinically actionable if prescribed a medication relevant to that gene. In multiple well-conducted studies, the results of PGx testing have been shown to guide therapy choice and dosing modifications which improve treatment efficacy and reduce the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Although the value of PGx testing is evident, its successful implementation in a clinical setting presents a number of challenges to molecular diagnostic laboratories, healthcare systems, providers and patients. Different molecular methods can be applied to identify PGx variants and the design of the assay is therefore extremely important. Once the genotyping results are available the biggest technical challenge lies in turning this complex genetic information into phenotypes and actionable recommendations that a busy clinician can effectively utilize to provide better medical care, in a cost-effective, efficient and reliable manner. In this paper we describe a successful and highly collaborative implementation of the PGx testing program at the University of Minnesota and MHealth Fairview Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory and selected Pharmacies and Clinics. We offer detailed descriptions of the necessary components of the pharmacogenomic testing implementation, the development and technical validation of the in-house SNP based multiplex PCR based assay targeting 20 genes and 48 SNPs as well as a separate CYP2D6 copy number assay along with the process of PGx report design, results of the provider and pharmacists usability studies, and the development of the software tool for genotype-phenotype translation and gene-phenotype-drug CPIC-based recommendations.

10,34746641,"Pharmacists' perceived role in supporting diabetes education and self-management in Ireland: a qualitative study.  Background: Support for people with diabetes is necessary for optimal self-management. Structured diabetes education programmes fulfil this need, but attendance rates are consistently low. The role of pharmacists has expanded but the profession remains underutilised in chronic disease management. The objective of this study is to explore pharmacists' perceived role in the support of diabetes education and self-management behaviours. Methods: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of community pharmacists in Ireland was conducted. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Ten pharmacists were interviewed. The four themes identified illustrate the juxtaposition of pharmacists' potential in diabetes care with the realities of current pharmaceutical practice. One theme outlined the relationship between the person with diabetes and the pharmacist, 'Patient or customer: the nature of the pharmacist relationship'. Two themes described the pharmacists' role in supporting diabetes education and self-management, 'Beyond medication: pharmacists' current and potential role in diabetes management' and 'Need for diabetes education'. The final theme highlighted the barriers to a more engaged role in patient care, 'Barriers: ""all the stuff that gets in the way""'. Conclusion: The relationship between pharmacists and people with diabetes could facilitate pharmacists in supporting diabetes self-management. However, variability across pharmacists' level of involvement and consistent resource barriers were noted. Pharmacists were poorly informed about structured diabetes education programmes. Further research is needed to explore this variability but there may be potential to enhance the pharmacist role in promoting attendance at structured diabetes education programmes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE The Institute for Safe Medication Practices classifies subcutaneous insulin as a high-risk medication. Concentrated U-500 insulin carries additional risks in comparison to conventional U-100 insulin, as the 5-fold more concentrated nature of this product, limitations to insulin pen dosing, and various devices for dose measurement may lead to miscommunication of patient-reported doses, resulting in downstream errors in ordering, verification, or administration. We describe a multifaceted approach to leveraging technical tools within the electronic health record (EHR) for U-500 insulin use. SUMMARY At Cleveland Clinic, the U-500 insulin use process evolved in a number of phases using EHR tools. Phase 1 included new clinical decision support and documentation tools during order entry, including a customized alert that fired during order entry recommending that the prescriber order a consult with endocrinology and requiring the prescriber to provide the patient's home insulin measuring device and the source of the patient's reported home dose. In order verification, a customized alert fired directing the pharmacist to contact the patient or patient's nurse and validate the information provided by the prescriber. Phase 2 involved transitioning dispensing of patient-specific doses from tuberculin syringes to U-500 insulin syringes. Phase 3 transitioned to use of U-500 insulin pens and included automatic dose rounding of ordered doses down to the nearest 5 units, and an additional customized pharmacist alert intended for cost conservation was added to fire if the patient had a recent administration of U-500 insulin documented, directing the pharmacist to determine whether the nurse needed a new pen dispensed. CONCLUSION Cleveland Clinic successfully implemented customized tools and processes within the EHR pertaining to the prescribing, verification, dispensing, and administration of U-500 insulin.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
12,34749427,"Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions. BACKGROUND Decision coaching is non-directive support delivered by a healthcare provider to help patients prepare to actively participate in making a health decision. 'Healthcare providers' are considered to be all people who are engaged in actions whose primary intent is to protect and improve health (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers). Little is known about the effectiveness of decision coaching. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of decision coaching (I) for people facing healthcare decisions for themselves or a family member (P) compared to (C) usual care or evidence-based intervention only, on outcomes (O) related to preparation for decision making, decisional needs and potential adverse effects. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Nursing and Allied Health Source (ProQuest), and Web of Science from database inception to June 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the intervention was provided to adults or children preparing to make a treatment or screening healthcare decision for themselves or a family member. Decision coaching was defined as: a) delivered individually by a healthcare provider who is trained or using a protocol; and b) providing non-directive support and preparing an adult or child to participate in a healthcare decision. Comparisons included usual care or an alternate intervention. There were no language restrictions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently screened citations, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data on characteristics of the intervention(s) and outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesised results using a random-effects model. If more than one study measured the same outcome using different tools, we used a random-effects model to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. We presented outcomes in summary of findings tables and applied GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS Out of 12,984 citations screened, we included 28 studies of decision coaching interventions alone or in combination with evidence-based information, involving 5509 adult participants (aged 18 to 85 years; 64% female, 52% white, 33% African-American/Black; 68% post-secondary education). The studies evaluated decision coaching used for a range of healthcare decisions (e.g. treatment decisions for cancer, menopause, mental illness, advancing kidney disease; screening decisions for cancer, genetic testing). Four of the 28 studies included three comparator arms.  For decision coaching compared with usual care (n = 4 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching compared with usual care improves any outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self-confidence, knowledge, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low.  For decision coaching compared with evidence-based information only (n = 4 studies), there is low certainty-evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in knowledge (SMD -0.23, 95% CI: -0.50 to 0.04; 3 studies, 406 participants). There is low certainty-evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in anxiety, compared with evidence-based information. We are uncertain if decision coaching compared with evidence-based information improves other outcomes (i.e. decision self-confidence, feeling uninformed) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. For decision coaching plus evidence-based information compared with usual care (n = 17 studies), there is low certainty-evidence that participants may have improved knowledge (SMD 9.3, 95% CI: 6.6 to 12.1; 5 studies, 1073 participants). We are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence-based information compared with usual care improves other outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self-confidence, feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. For decision coaching plus evidence-based information compared with evidence-based information only (n = 7 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence-based information compared with evidence-based information only improves any outcomes (i.e. feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, knowledge, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Decision coaching may improve participants' knowledge when used with evidence-based information. Our findings do not indicate any significant adverse effects (e.g. decision regret, anxiety) with the use of decision coaching. It is not possible to establish strong conclusions for other outcomes. It is unclear if decision coaching always needs to be paired with evidence-informed information. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of decision coaching for a broader range of outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
13,34749777,"Implementing a personalized pharmaceutical plan in kidney or liver transplant patients: study protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (GRePH). BACKGROUND Nowadays, the main challenge of transplantation is the improvement of long-term care, aiming at reducing treatment-related complications and at decreasing rejection rates. Patients' adherence to both treatment and hygienic-dietary measures is mandatory to achieve these objectives. Adherence to immunosuppressive drugs is estimated to be only 70%. We hypothesized that the implementation of a personalized pharmaceutical plan (PPP) would increase adherence and therefore graft survival. METHODS/DESIGN This study is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with transplantation units defining clusters. Twelve clusters from 10 university hospitals were recruited. All centres started on the same day in the control phase. Every 7 weeks, one centre will switch to the intervention phase and remain there until the end of inclusions. We plan to recruit 1716 kidney and/or liver transplant patients. The intervention phase consists in setting up the PPP: development of the patient's hospital and community pharmaceutical follow-up. In the hospital, the pharmacist will carry out drug reconciliation upon admission, daily pharmaceutical follow-up of prescriptions and pharmaceutical interviews with the patient in order to explain the modalities of taking immunosuppressive drugs and hygienic-dietary measures. After hospitalization, during the post-transplantation year, pharmaceutical meetings will take place, prior to medical consultations in order to check the patient's understanding of the prescription, his adherence, to remind them of hygienic-dietary measures and to look for adverse effects. The hospital pharmacist will also be in charge of establishing a close link with the community pharmacist (CP) and general practitioner, especially providing discharge medication reconciliation, an e-learning and a checklist. Moreover, prior to each pharmaceutical consultation, the hospital pharmacist will contact the CP to discuss patient adherence. The primary outcome is adherence to immunosuppressive treatments 1 year post-transplantation assessed by using the BAASIS questionnaire and the health insurance data from the national health data system. A medico-economic study will measure the efficiency of this plan. DISCUSSION GRePH aims to increase adherence of liver and/or kidney transplant patients to their immunosuppressive therapies in order to reduce transplant rejections. To this end, a new clinical pharmacy model, the PPP, will be set up in 10 university hospitals. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04295928 .

OBJECTIVE The aim of this scoping review is to describe and map the evidence around COVID-19 and H1N1 vaccination hesitancy or refusal among physicians, nurses, and pharmacists across North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. INTRODUCTION When global pandemics occur, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in 2020, and the swine flu influenza pandemic (H1N1) of 2009, there is increased pressure for pharmaceutical companies and government agencies to develop safe and effective vaccines against these highly contagious illnesses. Following development and approvals, it then becomes essential that priority populations, including frontline health care providers, opt to receive these vaccinations to prevent illness and potential transmission to their patients. However, vaccine hesitancy or refusal has played a significant role in suboptimal vaccination rates globally. As health care providers, including physicians, nurses and pharmacists, often administer vaccines, their vaccination views and behaviors are of great importance as they can directly affect the vaccination decisions of their patients.

18,34751891,"A pharmacist-led intervention to improve the management of opioids in a general practice: a qualitative evaluation of participant interviews.  Background Opioid prescribing has escalated, particularly long-term in chronic noncancer pain. Innovative models of care have been recommended to augment regulatory and harm-minimisation strategies and to review the safety and benefits of opioids for the individual patient. Medication stewardship and pharmacist integration are evolving approaches for general practice. Aim To explore enablers, barriers, and outcomes of a pharmacist-led intervention to improve opioid management in general practice, from the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) and practice personnel. Method The study was part of a mixed-methods investigation into a general practice pharmacist pilot. Qualitative data relevant to opioids were analysed. Data from 13 semi-structured interviews were coded, analysed iteratively and thematically, and interpreted conceptually through the framework of Opioid Stewardship fundamentals proposed by the National Quality Forum. Results Seven themes and 14 subthemes aligned with stewardship fundamentals. Participants considered organisational policy, supported by leadership and education, fostered collaboration and consistency and improved practice safety. Patient engagement with individualised resources, 'agreements' and 'having the conversation' with the pharmacist enabled person-centred opioid review and weaning. GPs reported greater accountability and reflection in their practices, in the broader context of opioid prescribing and dilemmas in managing patients transitioning through care. Receiving feedback on practice deprescribing outcomes encouraged participants' ongoing commitment. Patient communication was deemed an early barrier; however, learnings were applied when transferring the model to other high-risk medicines. Conclusion Improved opioid management was enabled through implementing pharmacist-led coordinated stewardship. The findings offer a practical application of guideline advice to individualise opioid deprescribing.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
19,34751985,"The psychological health of patients diagnosed with cancer in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single center study. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the psychological health status of patients diagnosed with cancer in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aim was to measure the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among patients diagnosed with cancer. Secondary aims were to assess the association between depression, anxiety, and stress with sociodemographic characteristics, cancer-specific characteristics, patients' experience in healthcare visit, risk perception towards COVID-19, and health concern during the outbreak. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020 at an Oncology clinic in Baghdad. Included in the study were two hundred patients diagnosed with cancer. Data collected included: demographic variables (age, gender, residential location, marital status, education, employment status), clinical characteristics and cancer-specific parameters (duration since cancer diagnosis, cancer type, treatment duration, clinic visits frequency), experience during the pandemic (skipping or postponing treatment or periodical tests, suffering from new body pain, fear of acquiring the infection, fear of health deterioration), as well as psychological health status (depression, anxiety, stress). Pain, risk perception towards COVID-19, and health concern were measured using categorical Likert scale with responses being no, sometimes, and often. The psychological health status was measured by the ""Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale"" (DASS-21). Cut-off scores of the DASS-21 greater than 9, 7, and 14 represent a positive screen of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. RESULTS The prevalence of patients who screened positive for depression was 22.0%, anxiety 22.0%, and stress 13.5%. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were significantly more in those who had university or higher education (34.3%, p-value <0.0001; 32.3%, p-value <0.0001; 19.2%, p-value = 0.02 respectively). Those were four times more likely to have depression and two times more likely to have anxiety than participants who had school education (OR = 4.40 CI [1.98-9.77], p-value <0.0001; OR = 2.55 CI [1.15-5.65], p-value = 0.02, respectively). The prevalence of anxiety was significantly the highest in the age group 16-39 years (40.9%) compared to 22.3% in the age group 40-64 years and 10.3% in the group ≥65 years (p-value = 0.02). Patients ≥65 years of age were less likely to develop anxiety compared to younger patients (OR = 0.44 CI [0.22-0.89], p-value = 0.02). As for the patients' experience in healthcare visit, 66 patients (33.0%) skipped or postponed their treatment or tests due to the outbreak. Around (8%) sometimes suffered from new body pain. Those who sometimes suffered from new body pain had significantly more depression than patients who did not suffer new pain or often had new pain (50.0% vs. 15.0% vs. 28.1% respectively, p-value = 0.002). Those were two times more likely to be depressed (OR = 2.18 CI [1.29-3.68], p-value = 0.003). Around (50%) of the patients were often afraid that their health would deteriorate during the outbreak. Those were significantly more depressed (31.7%, p-value = 0.002), anxious (30.7%, p-value <0.0001) and stressed (21.8%, p-value = 0.002) than those who did not have fear of losing their health and were two times more likely to have anxiety and stress. CONCLUSION These findings, especially the association between developing new pain and depression, raised concerns regarding the psychological health in patients diagnosed with cancer during COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial to implement psychological health screening for patients diagnosed with cancer during the pandemic to help prevent any psychological health problems. The DASS-21 could be used as a screening tool for distress in these patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
20,34752512,"Qualitative Investigation of Community Pharmacy Immunization Enhancement Program Implementation.  Background: Despite widely available nonseasonal immunization services in community pharmacies, actual pharmacist-administered vaccines are not yet optimal. A flexible choice multicomponent intervention, the ""We Immunize"" program, was implemented in Alabama and California community pharmacies, with the goal to enhance pneumococcal and zoster immunization delivery. Limited research has been done to qualitatively understand factors influencing immunization service expansion. Objective: Explore pharmacist perceptions of the We Immunize program in terms of its acceptability, impact, and real-world feasibility, and pharmacist-perceived facilitators and barriers influencing success in immunization delivery enhancement. Methods: This practice-focused qualitative research used semistructured telephone interviews with 14 pharmacists at the completion of the 6-month intervention. Results: Major program implementation facilitators were technician inclusion, workflow changes, training and feedback, goal setting, and enhanced personal selling and marketing activities. Multiple pharmacies increased the number of delivered pneumococcal and zoster immunizations, and increased revenue. Many pharmacists felt professional image, knowledge, skills, roles, and personal satisfaction were enhanced, as were technician knowledge, skills, and roles. Program flexibility, along with multiple perceived benefits, increases the potential for success. Conclusions: The We Immunize program appears to have been viewed positively by participating pharmacists and was seen as having a beneficial impact on immunization delivery in the community pharmacies in which it was implemented.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
21,34752515,"Development and Implementation of Interprofessional Relations Between a College of Pharmacy and Osteopathic Residency Programs in a Community Teaching Hospital.  Background: Team-based health care optimizes patient outcomes, and therefore, both interprofessional education (IPE) and interprofessional relations (IPR) are required in health professions education, postgraduate training, and real-world clinical practice. Existing literature describes progressive developments and assessments of IPE in colleges of pharmacy and medicine; however, there are fewer reports describing processes or projects that foster physician-pharmacist IPR in clinical practices without established interprofessional collaborations. Objectives: The primary objective was to establish IPR between pharmacists and osteopathic residents in a community teaching hospital. The secondary objective was to innovate the delivery of pharmacotherapeutic content delivered to the residents during their didactic lecture series by providing active learning strategies. Methods: This report describes a project wherein college of pharmacy faculty developed IPR with osteopathic residents in a community teaching hospital that previously did not have any established physician-pharmacist IPR. Osteopathic medical residents completed a post-implementation survey after they attended a 12-month series of didactic lectures that incorporated active learning delivered by pharmacist faculty. Results: Sixty-six residents were eligible to complete the survey; 20 residents completed the survey. Eighteen residents believed that both physicians and pharmacists should be educated to establish IPR and that it should be included in professional, graduate, and continuing education settings for both professions. Sixteen residents believed that the active learning techniques employed by college of pharmacy faculty were useful for IPR. Conclusions: Physician-pharmacist IPR may be achievable in settings where IPR was previously sparse. Shared interests, adherence, and innovations in IPR frameworks are essential for developing physician-pharmacist IPR.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
22,34752516,"Oxcarbazepine-Induced Cutaneous Reaction in a Female of Mexican Ancestry.  Objectives: To report an oxcarbazepine (OXC)-induced cutaneous reaction in a female of Mexican ancestry. Case Summary: A 60-year-old female of Mexican ancestry presented to clinic with a diffuse morbilliform rash, with erythema and eruptions of papules/pustules concentrated on her neck and torso. The rash appeared 1 week following the initiation of OXC for trigeminal neuralgia. Initially, the correlation between the reaction and initiation of OXC was not recognized by the provider. OXC was continued for a total of 4 weeks and several medical encounters transpired in the interim. Supportive therapy, in the form of oral antihistamines and oral/topical corticosteroids, failed to resolve the rash. A clinical pharmacist prompted the discontinuation of OXC due to suspicion that it incited the adverse reaction. Oral corticosteroid therapy was initiated and tapered over 2 weeks, with rash dissipation occurring in 1 month. Discussion: The association of OXC with the cutaneous eruption was classified as ""probable"" based on the Naranjo Scale. While financial resources were not available to perform genetic testing, it may be possible that the genetic status of this patient lent itself to greater potential for cutaneous reactions with OXC. Further research is needed to determine whether pharmacogenetic variables affiliated with pre-Columbian lineage may predispose individuals to specific adverse drug reactions. Conclusion: As regional genotypes disperse globally, it is imperative that clinicians are cognizant of risks regarding genetically implicated adverse drug reactions. While information is limited for certain ethnicities, it is essential that providers diligently monitor all populations for reactions characteristic to specific medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
23,34752518,"Comparison of Interventions Made in an Ambulatory Pharmacist-Managed Refill Model to Usual Physician Care.  Background: With the current practice model, there is less time for physicians to address refill authorization requests (RARs) while performing consistent quality care, which creates an opportunity for pharmacists to assist in refills. Currently, inadequate evidence is available to support this intervention. Objective: To compare the rate of medication management interventions (MMIs - drug therapy changes, laboratory monitoring ordered, or office visit scheduled) initiated by the pharmacist-managed authorization center (PMAC) to usual care. Methods: A retrospective, noninferiority study looked at 4000 RARs from 6 primary care centers from January 2016 through March 2017. The primary endpoint compared the rate of MMIs between PMAC and usual care. Noninferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the difference in interventions was <2%. Secondary endpoints included total, type, and acceptance rate of PMAC recommendations. Results: A total of 3830 patients were included, with 4732 medications requested (2183 reviewed by PMAC and 2549 by usual care). MMIs occurred in 153 medications within PMAC (7.0%) versus 90 for usual care (3.5%). The difference in total MMIs between PMAC and usual care was -3.5% (95% confidence interval = -4.8% to -2.2%). Medications reviewed by PMAC had significantly higher number of laboratory monitoring (P = .036) and scheduled appointments (P < .001). There were 294 PMAC recommendations (13.5%) with a 52.0% acceptance rate. Conclusion and Relevance: This study showed that PMAC was superior to usual care for reviewing RARs.

24,34752520,"Prescribing of Pressor Agents in Septic Shock: A Survey of Critical Care Pharmacists.  Background: Pressor agents are recognized as high-alert medications by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, but little evidence is available to guide their use in septic shock. Objective: Characterize the use of pressor agents for septic shock in clinical practice. Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey assessing demographics, institutional practices, and respondent perceptions related to pressor agents was distributed to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy Critical Care Practice and Research Network. The primary outcome was the use of a weight-based dosing (WBD) strategy versus non-WBD strategy for norepinephrine. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey results. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine variables associated with dosing strategies. Results: The survey was completed by 223 respondents. The typical respondent worked in a medical or mixed intensive care unit at a teaching hospital and had training and/or board certification beyond the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Nearly all respondents (n = 221, 99%) reported norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor for septic shock; however, 38% used WBD and 60% used non-WBD. In logistic regression, respondents located in the South and practicing at institutions with larger numbers of intensive care unit beds were more likely to use WBD for norepinephrine infusions. Similar findings were observed with epinephrine and phenylephrine. Conclusion: Wide variability exists in prescribing patterns of pressor agents and in pharmacist perceptions regarding best practices. The use of WBD varied based on institutional characteristics and resulted in higher maximum allowable infusion rates of pressor agents. Future research should compare dosing strategies to identify associations with patient outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

26,34752523,"Determination of the Optimal Procalcitonin Threshold for Infection in Patients With Impaired Renal Function at a Community Hospital.  Background: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker that can help identify bacterial infections but can be difficult to interpret in the presence of renal dysfunction, which can elevate PCT even in the absence of infection. Objective: To determine the optimal PCT threshold to identify infection in patients with renal dysfunction and pneumonia or sepsis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for inpatients with creatinine clearance of ≤60 mL/min and PCT level from 2018 to 2019. A pharmacist blinded to study outcomes classified patients as infected or noninfected based on predetermined criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to establish the optimal PCT threshold overall, as well as in subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Institutional review board approval was obtained. Results: A total of 198 patients were included in the study (99 infected, 99 noninfected). The optimal threshold in the AKI, CKD, and ESRD subgroups was determined to be 1.5 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, and 1.75 ng/mL, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study show that PCT thresholds were specific to type of renal dysfunction. These results differ from the traditionally accepted PCT threshold of 0.5 ng/mL for sepsis and 0.25 mg/mL for pneumonia. Future studies should confirm the appropriate PCT threshold in ESRD and CKD patient populations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
27,34752524,"An Evaluation of Pharmacist-Led Interventions for Inpatient HIV-Related Medication Errors.  Background: Inpatient HIV-related medication errors occur in up to 86% of patients. Objective: To evaluate the number of antiretroviral therapy (ART)- and opportunistic infection (OI)-related medication errors following the implementation of pharmacist-directed interventions. Methods: This quasi-experiment assessed adult patients with HIV who received ART, OI prophylaxis, or both from December 1, 2014, to February 28, 2017 (pre-intervention) or December 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018 (post-intervention). Pre-intervention patients were assessed retrospectively; verbal and written education were provided (intervention); prospective audit and feedback was conducted for post-intervention patients. The primary outcome was rate of ART errors between groups. Secondary outcomes included rate of OI errors, time to resolution of ART and OI errors, types of errors, and rate of recommendation acceptance. Results: Sixty-seven patients were included in each group. ART errors occurred in 44.8% and 32.8% (P = .156), respectively. OI prophylaxis errors occurred in 11.9% versus 9% (P = .572), respectively. Medication omission decreased significantly in the post-intervention group (31.3% vs 11.9%; P = .006). Pharmacist-based interventions increased in the post-intervention group (6.3% vs 52.9%; P = .001). No statistical difference was found in time to error resolution (72 vs 48 hours; P = .123), but errors resolved during admission significantly increased (50% vs 86.8%; P < .001). No difference was found in rate of intervention acceptance (100% vs 97%). Conclusion and Relevance: ART and OI prophylaxis errors resolved a day faster in the pharmacist-led, post-intervention period, and there was a trend toward error reduction.

29,34752530,"Team Communication on Tasks Performed in Blood Pressure Clinics in Community Pharmacies.  Background: To successfully deliver pharmacy services, pharmacists and technicians need to work as a team and have effective communication. Objectives: To measure the amount of communication between community pharmacists and their technicians during monthly blood pressure (BP) clinics. Methods: Cross-sectional survey method was used to assess the amount of communication pharmacists and technicians had on each task. Study participants were pharmacist-technician pairs (teams) from 10 intervention community pharmacies in the Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) trial. Each team provided services designed to improve BP among hypertensive African American patients. Thirteen specific tasks were identified as essential in providing monthly BP clinics, and they were being performed by either the pharmacist or technician. At the end of the trial, each pharmacist and technician were asked to report his/her perception of discussion levels that occurred for each task. The level of team communication was summarized for each task (task-specific) and for each team (team-specific). Results: For task-specific communication, 3 teams had communication regarding pharmacist tasks and 5 teams engaged in communication for technician tasks. More communication was reported for newly developed technician tasks in the BP clinic. For team-specific communication, 2 teams reported no communication on any task, and another 2 teams reported having communication on all the tasks. Overall, pharmacy teams showed different levels of communication in this study. Conclusion: The amounts of communication between pharmacists and technicians were found to vary for different tasks and teams. This suggests that the nature of tasks and the unique dynamics existing in each pharmacy team could influence pharmacist-technician communication.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
30,34752531,"Parallel Assessment of Chemotherapy Adherence and Supportive Therapy Adherence on Occurrence and Minimization of Adverse Drug Reactions Among Cancer Patients: A Clinical-Based Observational Study.  Background: Cancer is a disease that is inevitably treated using chemotherapy, but the cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment have the potency to cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Thus, supportive therapy plays an essential role in managing the untoward effects of the cancer drugs in patients. This highlights the importance of medication adherence in managing the disease, mitigating and preventing the occurrence of chemotherapy-induced ADR without compromising the health status of the cancer population. Objective: To assess the adherence to chemotherapy and supportive therapy and to evaluate type and degree of causality of ADRs observed in cancer patients. Methods: On ethics committee approval, a 6-month observational study was conducted among recruited cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in a tertiary care hospital. Morisky Medication Adherence Measurement Scale-8 was employed to assess the medication adherence, and ADR causality was determined using Naranjo ADR Probability Scale. Results: Ninety cancer patients participated in the study, out of which females were 61.11%. Chemotherapy adherence in comparison to supportive drugs was observed to be more (21.11%). Twelve different combination of ADR were reported in the subjects with variability in the degree of causality assessment. Conclusion and Relevance: The distinction of adherence to the medication used in cancer management with marked level of ADR was well depicted in the study, implicating the necessity of prudent symbiotic practice of an oncology pharmacist, patient, and physician relationship in optimizing the quality of life of cancer patients by imparting vigilant efforts in medication adherence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
31,34752534,"Strategy to Improve Efficiency of Comprehensive Medication Reviews in a Community Pharmacy.  Background: Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) provide opportunities for pharmacists to perform clinical services to their patients. However, pharmacists are often not able to perform CMRs due to time constraints. Studies have shown that incorporating support staff into the CMR workflow may lead to increases in the completion of CMRs. Objective: The primary objective was to examine the change in the number of CMRs completed at the pharmacy after a new strategy was implemented to perform and prepare for CMRs. The secondary objective was to examine the changes in the revenue generated from CMRs. Methods: This study was a pre-post retrospective, observational study performed at an independent pharmacy. Data were collected and analyzed 10 months before and after implementation of a new strategy. The new strategy called for pharmacy interns to use a template for working up patients prior to CMRs. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were run on IBM SPSS, Version 24.0, to determine the significance of the changes. Results that generated P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The total number of CMRs completed increased from 29 before the intervention to 158 after the intervention (P = .009). The revenue generated from CMRs improved statistically (P = .007). Conclusions: Implementing a strategic workflow that uses pharmacy interns and a patient workup template can significantly increase the number of CMRs completed in a community pharmacy. Appropriate delegation of such tasks may allow more time for pharmacists to deliver more CMRs. Additional benefits include increased compensation from delivering more CMRs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

33,34752541,"Impact of a Clinical Decision-Support Tool on Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Acutely Ill Medical Patients.  Background: Adherence to guideline-based venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis recommendations is often inadequate. Effective improvement strategies are needed. Objective: The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to increase use of the facility's preferred pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, reduce unnecessary VTE prophylaxis use, and reduce use of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in high bleeding risk patients, in accordance with guideline-based recommendations. Methods: Clinical pharmacists spearheaded the development and implementation of a clinical decision-support tool (CDST) integrated within a Veterans Health Administration electronic health record (EHR). The CDST focused on VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients and guided prescribers to guideline-based recommendations. Following review and approval, the CDST underwent activation in the EHR. A subsequent intervention occurred, year 2 post-intervention, which embedded this CDST into the EHR admission process and admission menus. A drug message was added in the EHR to alert prescribers that low-molecular-weight heparin was the preferred agent. Measures were evaluated pre-intervention, year 1 post-intervention, and year 2 post-intervention. Results: After intervention, there were statistically significant increases in the proportion of patients receiving the facility's preferred pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis agent, enoxaparin, and a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of unwarranted VTE prophylaxis. The proportion of inappropriate pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in high bleeding risk patients decreased, but this result did not reach statistical significance.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and type of MRPs attributed to rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge from a general internal medicine hospitalists' service at a nonacademic medical center. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted evaluating consecutive patients readmitted within 30-days after discharge to home from an internal medicine hospitalist service. Readmissions attributed to MRPs in physician documentation were systematically classified as indication, effectiveness, adverse drug reaction, or nonadherence problems and evaluated for possible preventability. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the rate and type of MRP. Results: Evaluation of consecutive 30-day readmissions (n = 203) to a nonteaching community hospital identified 50.2% of admissions attributed to MRPs. MRPs (n = 102) were categorized as problems of indication (34.3%), efficacy (19.6%), adverse drug events (18.6%), and nonadherence (27.5%). One third of 30-day readmissions in this cohort were attributed to potentially preventable MRPs. Conclusion: MRPs are frequently implicated in 30-day hospital readmissions in a nonteaching community hospital representing an opportunity for context-specific improvements.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
41,34752559,"Identifying Barriers That Prevent the Usage of Health Information Exchange in Ohio.  Background: As clinical services expand in community pharmacies, access to patient information through a health information exchange (HIE) may be of increased benefit to patient care. Objectives: To identify perceptions and barriers to the use of HIE by high-performing clinical pharmacists within a grocery store chain and collect other health care provider perceptions of using HIE. Methods: Two web-based surveys consisting of multiple choice, select all that apply, and 5-point Likert-type scale questions were administered via email to Ohio pharmacists working in high clinical performing pharmacies and Ohio health care providers utilizing CliniSync, an Ohio-based HIE program. Outcomes measured included pharmacist perceptions of preparedness to participate in HIE, their relationship with patients and health care providers, and barriers to utilizing HIE. Provider outcomes included perceptions of relationships with patients, awareness of community pharmacy services, referral habits, and perceived benefit of a HIE. Results: Pharmacists tend to believe they have the skill (median 5, interquartile range [IQR] 1) and desire (median 5, IQR 1) to be a part of the HIE network. Pharmacists appear confident in their abilities to provide patient care as a part of HIE networks (median 4, IQR 1). While 66% of providers surveyed are aware of services provided by community pharmacists, 75% state that they do not refer patients to a pharmacy for those services. Conclusion: Implementing HIE into clinical pharmacy workflow and encouraging providers to use it to make patient health information available to pharmacists would provide additional information for pharmacists to review when providing clinical services in the community pharmacy setting, ultimately benefiting patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To provide a review of 3 novel antimicrobial agents-ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem/cilastatin-relebactam-regarding treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (KPC). Data Sources: A literature search of PubMed and OVID (MEDLINE) was performed up to March 2020 using the following search terms: Vabomere, meropenem-vaborbactam, vaborbactam, RPX7009, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, KPC, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CRE, relebactam, imipenem-relebactam, MK-7655, ceftazidime-avibactam. Abstracts from conferences, article bibliographies, and product information were also reviewed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles were first screened by English language, then title, then abstract, and finally by review of the full article. Fifty-five clinical and preclinical studies were included. Data Synthesis: These 3 novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations have shown considerable improvement in safety and efficacy as compared with traditional polymyxin-based combination therapy for the treatment of KPC infections. While meropenem-vaborbactam has not shown improved activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has shown decreased rates of resistance to KPC versus ceftazidime-avibactam. Conclusions: With increasing incidence of KPC infections on a global scale, pharmacists should be aware of the notable similarities and differences between these 3 agents, and the current data supporting their use. Pharmacists may want to consider meropenem-vaborbactam over ceftazidime-avibactam for KPC infections due to decreased likelihood of resistance.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
43,34752561,"A Comparison of Tertiary Drug Resources' Consistency Regarding Drug-Drug Interactions of Adjunctive Analgesics.  Background: Health care providers routinely rely on tertiary drug information resources to affirm knowledge or proactively verify the safety and efficacy of medications. Though all patient care areas are affected, the reliability of these resources is perhaps nowhere as poignant as it is in high-acuity settings, including the emergency department and the intensive care unit. As providers seek to identify adjunctive analgesics for acute pain in these areas, they must be able to rely on the integrity to whichever resource their institution has granted access. Objective: To determine the congruency of drug-drug interaction information found on 3 tertiary drug resources. Methods: A drug-drug interaction analysis was conducted on Micromedex, Lexicomp, and Medscape. Adjunctive analgesics included dexmedetomidine and ketamine, which were compared with the intravenous opioid products morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone. Results: Significant discrepancies were appreciated with regard to the severity of drug-drug interactions. In addition, the heterogeneity in which reaction severity and likelihood are described by each respective resource makes direct comparisons difficult. Interaction warnings for dexmedetomidine and fentanyl included a ""major interaction"" from Micromedex, whereas Lexicomp did not identify a risk and Medscape only recommended increased monitoring on the grounds of respiratory and central nervous system depression. Conclusions: Health care providers must remain vigilant when reviewing tertiary drug information resources. Pharmacists possess the training and skills necessary to assist interdisciplinary medical teams in providing optimal patient care through evaluating and applying the information gleaned from these resources.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
44,34752562,"Impact of Protocolized Pharmacist Intervention on Critical Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time Values With Heparin Infusions.  Background: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions are commonly managed with nurse-driven nomograms titrated to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In some patients, anti-Xa values may be more appropriate measures of anticoagulation. At the present institution, an update to the nurse-driven aPTT nomogram requires pharmacist notification and clinical assessment for critically supratherapeutic aPTT results. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the nomogram update. Methods: A single-center, retrospective, pre-post analysis was conducted in patients treated with UFH who experienced a critical aPTT during the 6 months preceding and following the nomogram update. Patients with erroneous critical aPTT results were excluded. The primary endpoint was the time in therapeutic range (Rosendaal method) from the first critical aPTT until UFH discontinuation. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients transitioned to anti-Xa monitoring and the incidence of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2, 3, 5 bleeding. Data were analyzed by the χ2 test. The study was institutional review board approved. Results: Of 277 UFH infusions, 142 belonged to the pre-implementation group and 135 to the post-implementation group. Baseline aPTTs were similar between the 2 groups. Time in therapeutic range was 58.1% versus 62.4% of between groups (P = .467). UFH was transitioned to pharmacist-driven anti-Xa monitoring in 16.2% versus 40.3% of patients (P < .001). BARC 2, 3, 5 bleeding occurred in 23.2% versus 13.4% of patients (P < .001).

45,34752565,"Retention of Sterile Compounding Knowledge Among Pharmacy Technicians.  Background: Patient safety is in jeopardy due to a rise in the preparation of adulterated parenteral products with poor technique identified as a significant contributing factor. Pharmacy technicians perform an overwhelming majority of aseptic compounding practices; however, this group's progressive loss of aseptic technique knowledge has not been documented. Objective: The purpose of this correlational research study was to investigate the association between sterile compounding knowledge and years in the field controlling for formal training in sterile compounding techniques. Methods: An assessment tool of fundamental sterile compounding content was electronically distributed to sterile compounding technician members of pharmacy organizations in the southeastern United States. A multiple regression was conducted to predict sterile compounding knowledge from number of years in the field and prior years of formal compounding training. Results: Sixty-eight assessments were returned complete. The overall model was significant (P < .0005), explaining 22% of the variance in knowledge retention. Years in the field was the only significant predictor (P < .001). Each additional year of work experience was associated with a 0.18 drop in the assessment score. Conclusions: The longer pharmacy technicians remain in the field, the more aseptic technique knowledge they will lose. Modeling of poor sterile compounding techniques in the workplace may promote loss of competency of the skill. As a result, a plan to address continuing education for pharmacy technician sterile compounders is necessary to ensure patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
46,34752567,"The Role of the Pharmacist in Inhaler Selection and Education in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.  Objective: To review the role of pharmacists in educating and monitoring patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on inhalation technique. Data Sources: A PubMed search (January 2000 to May 2020) was performed using the following keywords and associated medical subject headings: adherence, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/COPD, education, inhaler, pharmacist, and technique. Study Selection and Data Extraction: The search was conducted to identify English language articles highlighting the importance of correct inhaler technique in COPD management and benefits of pharmacist inhaler training such as improved adherence, quality of life (QoL), and disease control. Randomized controlled trials, retrospective studies, observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis reporting pharmacist training were included. Data Synthesis: This review summarizes that incorrect inhaler use negatively affects treatment outcomes, prognosis, and QoL. Pharmacists are in a unique position to educate and monitor patients with COPD on optimal inhaler technique and an individualized, multifactorial approach to COPD management involving pharmacists could provide cost-effective patient care and improve adherence and minimize inhaler misuse. Several strategies used by pharmacists can optimize patient inhaler use, such as face-to-face technique demonstrations, the ""teach-back"" method, telemonitoring, instructional videos, or informational leaflets. An individualized action plan involving education and regular monitoring of inhaler use further enhances optimal adherence and disease management. Conclusions: As pharmacists are easily accessible to both patients and health care providers, they are ideally placed to play an important role in the enhancement of education on, and continuous assessment of, optimal inhaler technique, thereby improving adherence, disease control, and QoL.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

48,34752571,"Investigating Pharmacists' Views on Telepharmacy: Prioritizing Key Relationships, Barriers, and Benefits.  Background: Telepharmacy can help deliver pharmaceutical advice from an expert pharmacist to another party, such as a physician, inexperienced pharmacist, or pharmacy technician. In this study, we consider term ""2-person discussions"" as teleconsultation between expert pharmacists to each of the aforementioned persons. Objectives: This study has 2 aims: first to prioritize 2-person discussions between the parties involved in telepharmacy services when we have limited budget and time and would like to implement the best efficient telepharmacy system. Second to examine the barriers and benefits of implementing a telepharmacy. Methods: The research population included 40 pharmacists working in Kerman pharmacies (Iran). Their viewpoints were evaluated using a valid and reliable researcher-made questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire focused on professional-demographic information, while the second part addressed the most important 2-person discussions and also asked about barriers to and benefits of implementing telepharmacy. Results: The findings indicate that the following 2-person discussions are priority for implementation: physician-pharmacist, pharmacist-hospital ward, and pharmacist-pharmacist. Payment and reimbursement issues and lack of access to information technology infrastructure were among the most important barriers. Efficient training about medicine usage, drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects was the most important benefit of telepharmacy. Conclusion: In this study, pharmacists' first priority regarding who to involve in a 2-person telepharmacy consultation was to establish a long-distance connection between physicians and pharmacists. This finding indicates that the pharmacists were more interested in providing teleconsultation services to physicians and other pharmacists rather than communicating with pharmaceutical technicians.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: The role of Idaho and Alaska pharmacists in providing health care services has steadily broadened over recent years. With many new pharmacist-provided health care service possibilities, this study assessed the impact of these advancements on community pharmacies. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify current pharmacist-provided health care services and pharmacist-perceived barriers to providing and billing for these services in Idaho and Alaska community pharmacies. Methods: A questionnaire was developed focusing on 2 areas: providing services and billing for services. Pharmacy students on experiential rotations administered the questionnaires to pharmacists at their rotation sites. Pharmacists at community pharmacy practice sites in Idaho and Alaska completed the questionnaire in an interview format conducted by students. Likert-type scale data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Because the study did not include a comparator group, no power calculation was conducted. All open-response answers were analyzed independently by 2 researchers and discrepancies in coding open-ended questions were resolved by discussion with a group of 4 researchers. Results: Most pharmacists reported that they already provide non-dispensing services, desired to implement new services, and had confidence in their team's ability to handle new services. Time and resources were the most cited barriers to providing new services; compensation, company support, and education were the most cited barriers to billing for services.

50,34752582,"Evaluating the Addition of a Clinical Pharmacist Service to a Midlevel Provider-Driven Culture Follow-up Program in a Community Emergency Department.  Background: The impact that an antimicrobial stewardship program can have on an inpatient setting has been well documented, but there are limited data on the use of an antimicrobial stewardship program in the emergency department (ED). Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of adding a pharmacist service to a midlevel provider-driven culture follow-up program in the ED on achieving optimal therapy. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with designations of pre- and post-interventions conducted at a large community hospital with the pre-intervention phase occurring from June 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019, and the post-intervention phase occurring from January 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020. The primary outcome was optimal antimicrobial therapy: a composite of optimal antibiotic, dose, and duration, prescribed after the culture resulted. Secondary outcomes included optimal antibiotic, dose, duration, and return to the ED within 30 days due to infection. Results: Optimal antimicrobial therapy received after the culture resulted occurred in 59 patients (26.81%) in the pre-implementation phase and 40 patients (43.96%) in the implementation phase (P = .003).

51,34752615,"A retrospective analysis of the impact of a hospital pharmacist-led procalcitonin protocol. DISCLAIMER In an effort to expedite the publication of articles , AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE Procalcitonin is a precursor hormone to calcitonin that increases in response to systemic inflammation, especially of bacterial origin, and is otherwise undetectable in healthy states. Studies have shown that following effective antimicrobial treatment, procalcitonin levels steadily decline. To be utilized however, procalcitonin determinations must be ordered at specific times during a patient's antimicrobial treatment. A retrospective medication-use evaluation of patients was performed at Medical Center Hospital and showed that in 70% of patients, initial procalcitonin levels were ordered inappropriately and procalcitonin levels were trended inconsistently during antibiotic treatment. METHODS A pharmacist-led procalcitonin protocol was developed and presented to medical staff committees for approval. Data was collected from patients presenting with suspected or confirmed sepsis or lower respiratory tract infections for whom procalcitonin levels were utilized. Patient outcomes before and after protocol implementation were compared. RESULTS A total of 400 patients were included in the study. The primary outcome of appropriate ordering of initial procalcitonin levels was improved in the postprotocol group relative to the preprotocol group (28% of patients [n = 56] vs 72% of patients [n = 144]; P < 0.001). Patients in the postprotocol group had a procalcitonin level checked at discontinuation more frequently (8% [n = 16] vs 37% [n = 74], P < 0.001) and had a higher rate of appropriate discontinuation of antibiotics (12% [n = 21] vs 46% [n = 77]; P < 0.001). The postprotocol group also had fewer mean days of antibiotic therapy (9.17 vs 6.01; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Studies have shown the usefulness of procalcitonin levels for antimicrobial stewardship, but for procalcitonin testing to be properly utilized it must be ordered at the correct times during the patient's therapy. The implementation of a hospital-wide pharmacist-led protocol resulted in an increase in appropriate ordering of baseline procalcitonin levels.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,Established through discussion to test label choices,,,Inpatient,Established through discussion to test label choices

Background: As the last health care provider encountered before an opioid is dispensed, pharmacists have a vital role in reducing unnecessary opioid exposure while facilitating access to non-opioid alternatives. Objective: To characterize pharmacist perceptions in providing interventions for patients with an opioid prescription for acute pain. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was administered over 3 months to pharmacy preceptors affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Pharmacy. The electronic survey utilized 7 demographical and baseline questions, 1 open-ended question, and 5 Likert-type scales to assess the following domains: responsibility in making decisions, willingness to provide information, comfort in speaking to patients, willingness to use a standing order, and importance of following up with patients. Results: Of the 380 participants invited to participate, 126 responded to at least one question and 90 completed all survey questions. Most participants were PharmD graduates practicing in hospital and community settings. Participants felt that opioids are frequently overprescribed and pharmacist interventions are often necessary. Most participants reported that pharmacists and physicians share similar responsibilities in making opioid-related decisions. Participants were willing to provide information about opioid alternatives but were only somewhat comfortable speaking to patients. Responses to the open-ended question revealed the following themes: Significance of educating the patient; Importance of alternatives to opioid medications; Impacts of pharmacist interventions; and Need for enhanced collaboration with physicians. Conclusions: Pharmacists face complex issues with limited clinical guidance when providing opioid-related interventions. Future research is needed to develop evidence-based clinical support tools and collaborative practice models.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
53,34753511,"Development of a model of medication review for use in clinical practice: Bristol medication review model. BACKGROUND Medication review is a core aspect of medicine optimisation, yet existing models of review vary substantially in structure and content and are not necessarily easy to implement in clinical practice. This study aimed to use evidence from the existing literature to identify key medication review components and use this to inform the design of an improved review model. METHODS A systematic review was conducted (PROSPERO: CRD42018109788) to identify randomised control trials of stand-alone medication review in adults (18+ years). The review updated that by Huiskes et al. (BMC Fam Pract. 18:5, 2017), using the same search strategy implemented in MEDLINE and Embase. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Key review components were identified, alongside relevant clinical and health service outcomes. A working group (patients, doctors and pharmacists) developed the model through an iterative consensus process (appraisal of documents plus group discussions), working from the systematic review findings, brief evidence summaries for core review components and examples of previous models, to agree on the main purpose of the review model, overarching model structure, review components and supporting material. RESULTS We identified 28 unique studies, with moderate bias overall. Consistent medication review components included reconciliation (26 studies), safety assessment (22), suboptimal treatment (19), patient knowledge/preferences (18), adherence (14), over-the-counter therapy (13) and drug monitoring (10). There was limited evidence from studies for improvement in key clinical outcomes. The review structure was underpinned by patient values and preferences, with parallel information gathering and evaluation stages, feeding into the final decision-making and implementation. Most key components identified in the literature were included. The final model was considered to benefit from a patient-centred, holistic approach, which captured both patient-orientated and medication-focused problems, and aligned with traditional consultation methods thus facilitating implementation in practice. CONCLUSIONS The Bristol Medication Review Model provides a framework for standardised delivery of structured reviews. The model has the potential for use by all healthcare professionals with relevant clinical experience and is designed to offer flexibility of implementation not limited to a particular healthcare setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Anticoagulants are the cornerstone therapy for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Pharmacists should be confident and equipped with the skill and updated knowledge in managing anticoagulation therapy. OBJECTIVE To explore self-reported confidence level of pharmacists, perceived reasons influencing their confidence and socio-demographic associated with high confidence level in the area of anticoagulation. METHODS A cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey was carried out among fully registered pharmacists who work in selected government hospitals and clinics in Borneo, Malaysia, from January 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS Overall, responses from 542 fully registered pharmacists were obtained. Proportion of respondents who claimed confident in providing necessary information to patient receiving warfarin (n = 479, 88.3%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to low molecular weight heparins (n = 317, 58.5%) and direct oral anticoagulants (n = 211, 38.9%). Respondents' perceived reasons that may influence their confidence level include experience in dealing with anticoagulants' cases (n = 469, 86.5%), knowledge on anticoagulants (n = 394, 72.7%) and knowledge on diseases needing anticoagulation therapy (n = 311, 57.4%).

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare lipid and blood pressure (BP) control before and after implementing a certified pharmacy technician (CPhT) protocol that optimized electronic health record (EHR) capabilities and shifted work from clinical pharmacy specialists (CPSs) to CPhT. SETTING Kaiser Permanente Colorado's pharmacist-managed cardiac risk reduction service (which manages dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes for all patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). PRACTICE DESCRIPTION In 2019, a protocol that optimized EHR capabilities and allowed work to be offloaded from CPS to CPhT was implemented. Filtered views within the EHR were created that bucketed patients with specific lipid results criteria. The CPhT protocol provided guidance to CPhT on determining whether patients were at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) goals, on appropriate statin intensity, adherent to medications, and whether the most recent BP was controlled. The CPhT notified CPS of uncontrolled patients who would assess and manage these patients, as necessary. The CPhT notified controlled patients of their results. PRACTICE INNOVATION Data on the outcomes of incorporating pharmacy technicians to support CPS clinical activities in ambulatory clinical pharmacy are limited. EVALUATION METHODS This retrospective study compared a ""Pharmacist-Driven"" (index date: January 1, 2016) with a ""Tech-Enhanced"" (index date: January 1, 2019) group. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients at all goals defined as LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, non-HDL < 100 mg/dL, and BP < 140/90 mm Hg at 1 year after the index dates.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE To describe the process used in a clinical pharmacist specialist (CPS)-led Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program initiative to increase naloxone distribution to veterans at high risk for overdose via provider education and identification of barriers to naloxone distribution. SUMMARY Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. One step toward counteracting the epidemic includes expanding access to and use of naloxone. The Veterans Health Administration has developed initiatives to target veterans at risk for opioid overdose, such as the Veterans Affairs (VA) OEND program. Pharmacists can play a unique role in OEND by both prescribing naloxone and educating patients and providers on risk mitigation strategies. Through provider education, patient education, and facility-wide initiatives, naloxone prescribing was increased by 9-fold from August 2016 to August 2018. In addition, the number of new naloxone prescribers increased by almost 7-fold during the intervention period. Naloxone distribution to high-risk groups drastically increased across all target groups. CONCLUSION CPS involvement in promoting OEND at VAPHS drastically increased rates of prescribing of naloxone kits to veterans at risk for opioid overdose. This initiative showed that a CPS can play multiple roles in supporting OEND outreach at a large healthcare setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

People with dementia were significantly and disproportionally affected at the height of the pandemic in England. Community pharmacies in England continued to operate during the pandemic but had to adjust the way they provided key healthcare services. The impact of these changes on the provision of medication services to people with dementia is underexplored. OBJECTIVE To explore the experiences of the community pharmacy team in supporting people with dementia and their family carers with the management of medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS An interpretivist/constructivist research paradigm was used; semi-structured one-to-one telephone interviews were conducted with any member of the community pharmacy team who had been involved in providing medication services to people with dementia in England before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment took place between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Fourteen participants were interviewed with equal numbers of qualified pharmacists and non-pharmacist staff. Participants were in their role for an average of 4.5 years. The analysis of interviews generated three themes: 1) key interactions curtailed due to COVID-19 restrictions, 2) utilising resources within and outside of the pharmacy to provide tailored services for people with dementia, and 3) the interplay between professional duty and personal values underpinned decisions to provide medication services. CONCLUSIONS The study provided a unique and important first insights to our understanding of how the community pharmacy team in England supported people with dementia and their family carers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These insights provide opportunities for reflection by individuals, healthcare teams, healthcare organisations, policy makers and the public, in an international context, to enable long-term planning, investment and implementation of strategies beyond the current pandemic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
62,34756404,"Meeting patient expectations: Development of an Emergency Department Pharmacist Practitioner service specification. BACKGROUND Emergency Department Pharmacist Practitioners (EDPPs) undertake both 'traditional' clinical pharmacy work, e.g. check prescriptions, and 'practitioner' work, e.g. perform clinical examinations. A recent study found a large variation in the extent and type of care provided. Whilst variation allows services to be tailored to local needs, it is important that care meets the minimum standards that are safe, effective, patient-centred, timely, efficient, and equitable. OBJECTIVE(S) To develop an EDPP service specification based on views of professional and patient stakeholders, primarily to support providers with delivery of high quality services. METHODS Patients, ED pharmacists and other ED healthcare professionals developed standards guided by the Institute of Medicine's quality domains. A panel of six ED pharmacists suggested and agreed on themes that should be included in the service specification. Additional themes were identified through interviews with eight patients who had been cared for by EDPPs as to their expectations of the service. Finally, a multidisciplinary expert panel of healthcare professionals and researchers reviewed and refined the service specification. RESULTS ED pharmacists developed 36 themes with consensus achieved for 25. Additional themes from the patient interviews concerned the communication and behaviour of EDPPs rather than specific clinical activities undertaken. Whilst patients were happy to be cared for by an EDPP working within their competence, for certain conditions (e.g. major trauma) they wanted a doctor as their main care provider. An evidence-based EDPP service specification of 52 criteria grouped into 4 categories was produced: direct patient care (29); other activities (10); general approach (10); and service structures (3). CONCLUSIONS As the product of both patient and expert input, EDs could align existing or newly developed services to the specification. Whether or not the specification actually improves the quality of EDPP services requires investigation, as does the absolute quality impact of services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
63,34756524,"Impact of a clinical pharmacist on provider prescribing patterns in a primary care clinic. BACKGROUND Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists have demonstrated beneficial outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Unfortunately, these agents are still underutilized in primary care practice. A clinical pharmacist was embedded at a primary care clinic to provide diabetes and hypertension management under a collaborative practice agreement with a supervising physician. OBJECTIVES This study will evaluate whether the presence of an embedded pharmacist in a primary care clinic affects prescribing patterns of novel, evidence-based diabetes therapies. METHODS We abstracted information on SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 agonist prescribing patterns from 3 primary care clinics across 2 time periods as a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We used a difference-in-difference analysis to compare prescription rates and assess the impact of embedding the pharmacist into clinical practice. Prescriptions written by the pharmacist were excluded. RESULTS Across all 3 clinics, 1309 and 1489 patients were included in the pre-intervention and postintervention periods, respectively. The percentage of patients prescribed either an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist, similar between both groups at baseline, rose to 11.6% in the nonintervention clinics and 15.0% in the intervention clinic. There was a statistically significant increase in SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 agonist prescribing in the intervention clinic compared with nonintervention clinics (P = 0.034). This change in prescribing patterns appeared even greater when excluding prescribers who were not present during both pre-intervention and postintervention periods (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION The presence of a pharmacist is associated with increased SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 agonist prescribing within a clinic, even in patients not seen directly by the pharmacist. These results suggest that an on-site clinical pharmacist providing care for patients with diabetes may indirectly influence the prescribing behavior of co-located primary care providers, increasing the adoption of novel noninsulin diabetic medications.",0,0,1,1,0,"Prescribing patterns are not considered a ""patient outcome""",,,,,,,,,
64,34756525,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmacist interventions in patients with heart failure in Thailand. INTRODUCTION Patients with heart failure (HF) are likely to have multiple diseases with complex therapy regimens. Pharmacist intervention in HF treatment can reduce all-cause mortality and hospitalization, but the economic outcome is not known. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist contribution in HF setting compared with usual care. METHODS A decision analytical model was developed to estimate the cost and outcome from a health care system perspective in Thailand. Clinical inputs were obtained from literature review. Pharmacist costs, hospitalization cost for HF, risk of hospitalization death, risk of nonhospitalization death, and readmission rate were based on data from Thailand. The cost and outcome were discounted at 3% annually. OUTCOME MEASURES The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and presented for the year 2020. A series of sensitivity analysis was also performed. RESULTS Pharmacist intervention incurred higher total costs than usual care, because total cost of pharmacists was 186,040 THB (5936 USD) whereas usual care cost was 151,654 THB (4839 USD). It also provided more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than usual care, from 2.4 to 2.8. In addition, patient life years (LY) were increasing from 3.3-3.8. This yielded an ICER of 77,398 THB/LY (2467 USD/LY) or 103,037 THB/QALYs (3,288 USD/QALYs). This ICER is considered to be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay level of 160,000 THB/QALY (5191.87 USD). CONCLUSION At this current situation in Thailand, pharmacists may represent good value for the nation's limited health care resources. The information should be used in national policies to plan for pharmacist work force implementation and production line in the near future.",0,0,1,1,0,Model,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical impact of an intensive community pharmacy-based Health and Wellness Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE) completed by second-year (P2) student pharmacists. DESIGN The Health and Wellness IPPE was a 1-week rotation developed to provide P2 student pharmacists with opportunities to provide clinical services to patients within the community pharmacy setting. Student pharmacists administered immunizations, performed blood pressure screenings and blood glucose measurements, and provided education to patients under the guidance of licensed pharmacist preceptors. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Second-year student pharmacists completing a required Health and Wellness IPPE rotation in the community pharmacy setting. OUTCOMES MEASURED Student pharmacist interventions were assessed to determine the course's clinical impact, and preceptors were surveyed regarding the feasibility of student pharmacists performing clinical services at their training sites. RESULTS A total of 147 student pharmacists completed the IPPE at 89 community pharmacy training sites and administered 9392 injections, 90% of which were influenza vaccinations. Student pharmacists performed 3458 patient health assessments, including measuring patients' blood pressure and blood glucose and reviewing patient education materials. Most preceptors indicated that core activities were feasible during the experience. CONCLUSION This study found that implementing a concentrated IPPE focused on immunizations and health screenings allowed student pharmacists to enhance their clinical skills and fulfill a large public health need, improving patient outcomes. Future studies should explore utilizing student pharmacists in community pharmacy settings to expand clinical services offered beyond these 2 services, such as diabetes risk tests, influenza point-of-care testing, and smoking cessation counseling.",0,0,1,1,0,"No control group, outcome ambiguous",,,,,,,,,
66,34756826,"Drug-related problems in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease identified during pretransplant comprehensive geriatric assessment. BACKGROUND Older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease may be exposed to a higher risk of adverse drug events due to chronic kidney disease and aging. The integration of clinical pharmacist into pretransplant comprehensive geriatric assessment is an opportunity to perform medication optimization. OBJECTIVE The aim was to describe drug-related problems in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. METHODS Observational study was conducted with retrospective data from July 2017 to April 2019. Patients≥65 years with advanced chronic kidney disease, referred by nephrologists for pretransplant comprehensive geriatric assessment were included. During medication optimization, the pharmacist evaluated the appropriateness of each medication prescribed and identified drug-related problems. Any drug-related problem identified lead to a pharmaceutical intervention. RESULTS In total, 103 patients were included (74.5±2.9 years, 26.2% female, 47.6% on dialysis). Overall, 394 drug-related problems were identified in 93.2% of patients (3.8±2.4 drug-related problems per patient) during the medication optimization. Cardiovascular medications (25.1%), antithrombotics (13.5%) and drugs for peptic ulcer and reflux disease (10.2%) were the most involved drugs in drug-related problems. Drug-related problems mainly concerned drugs without indication (27.1%), inappropriate method of administration (24.4%) and non-conformity to guidelines (20.1%). CONCLUSION A high prevalence of drug-related problems in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease was identified during medication optimization. The systematic integration of a clinical pharmacist in the multidisciplinary team performing pretransplant comprehensive geriatric assessment may be relevant to detect inappropriate prescriptions and to prevent from adverse drug events.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
67,34757515,"The CombiConsultation: a new concept of sequential consultation with the pharmacist and practice nurse/general practitioner for patients with a chronic condition.  The primary health care system is generally well organized for dealing with chronic diseases, but comprehensive medication management is still a challenge. Studies suggest that pharmacists can contribute to effective and safe drug therapy by providing services like a clinical medication review (CMR). However, several factors limit the potential impact of a CMR. Therefore, we propose a new pharmaceutical care service for patients with a chronic condition: the CombiConsultation. The CombiConsultation is a medication evaluation service conducted by the (community) pharmacist and either the practice nurse or general practitioner. It consists of 3 steps: medication check, implementation and follow-up. The pharmacist primarily focusses on setting treatment goals for 1 or 2 drug-related problems in relation to a specific chronic condition. In this manuscript we describe the process and characteristics of the CombiConsultation. We compare the CombiConsultation with the CMR and explain the choices made and the implications for implementation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE This article identifies, prioritizes, and summarizes published literature on the medication-use process (MUP) from calendar year 2020 that can impact health-system pharmacy daily practice. SUMMARY The MUP is the foundational system that provides the framework for safe medication utilization within the healthcare environment. The MUP is defined in this article as having the following components: prescribing/transcribing, dispensing, administration, and monitoring. Articles evaluating at least one step of the MUP were assessed for their usefulness in practice improvement. A PubMed search for articles published in calendar year 2020 was conducted in January 2021 using targeted Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords, and the table of contents of selected pharmacy journals was searched, providing a total of 9,433 articles. A thorough review identified 49 potentially practice-enhancing articles: 15 for prescribing/transcribing, 10 for dispensing, 6 for administration, and 18 for monitoring. Ranking of the articles for importance by peers led to the selection of key articles from each category. The highest-ranked articles are briefly summarized, with a mention of why they are important within health-system pharmacy. The other articles are listed for further review and evaluation. CONCLUSION It is important to routinely review the published literature and to incorporate significant findings into daily practice. This article assists in identifying and summarizing the most impactful recently published literature.

71,34758925,"Transformational strategies for optimizing use of medications and related therapies through us pharmacists and pharmacies: Findings from a national study. SETTING Nonoptimized medication therapies (NOMTs) are associated with likely avoidable illnesses and mortality affecting millions of people and costing an estimated $528 billion per year in excess health spending in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought into focus barriers limiting the ability of U.S. pharmacists and pharmacies to provide services that can reduce NOMTs and improve U.S. population health. OBJECTIVES This National Science Foundation Center for Health Organization Transformation study explored potential strategies that U.S. pharmacists, pharmacies, and their partners could implement to reduce NOMTs while also delivering other forms of value to U.S. populations from 2021 to 2025 (during and after the COVID-19 pandemic). DESIGN A panel of senior leaders representing the U.S. pharmacist and pharmacy sector participated in a 4-round Delphi process to identify unmet needs, barriers, change drivers, and priority strategies for meeting those needs. Data were gathered and analyzed by public health researchers, most of whom are outside the pharmacist and pharmacy sector. RESULTS A comprehensive set of evidence-based strategies with potential to reduce NOMTs, protect and improve population health and well-being, and strengthen the sector were identified. Four transformational strategies were recommended: comprehensive payment and practice transformation, strengthening pharmacy data interoperability infrastructure, development of unifying measurement and management mechanisms, and development of a more robust national research infrastructure. Strengthening health equity was a cross-cutting strategy affecting all areas. CONCLUSION The results may be of interest to policy makers, pharmacists, pharmacies, physicians, nurses and other clinicians, pharmaceutical firms, plan sponsors, plans, health systems, clinics, aging care, digital technology companies, and others interested in optimizing outcomes from medications and related therapies for U.S. POPULATIONS ",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: Pharmacist's direct intervention or participation in multidisciplinary management teams can improve the clinical outcome and quality of life of patients. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions on the inappropriate use of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) pharmacotherapy in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: A systematic review was performed for relevant studies using searched PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid), the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and four Chinese databases from the establishment of databases to 12 March 2020. We conducted a descriptive analysis of participants, the intervention content and delivery, and the effects on inappropriate medication rates. Results: From 529 records, 8 studies from 9 articles were included in the systematic review. The time of appropriateness judgment and the criteria of ""appropriate"" varied from included studies. Pharmacist interventions mainly included clarifying indications for SUP pharmacotherapy, education and awareness campaign, reviewed patients on SUP pharmacotherapy during rounds, and adjustments of drug use. Five (62.5%) studies found a significant intervention effect during hospitalization, while 2 (25%) studies at ICU transfer and 2 (25%) studies at hospital discharge. 4 (50%) studies identified the complications related to SUP pharmacotherapy and found no significant difference. 4 (50%) studies declared the pharmacist-led interventions were associated with cost savings. Conclusion: Pharmacist-led intervention is associated with a decrease in inappropriate use of SUP pharmacotherapy during hospitalization, at ICU transferred and hospital discharged, and a lot of medical cost savings. Further research is needed to determine whether pharmacist-led intervention is cost-effective.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Critical care,Established through discussion to test label choices,,,Inpatient,Established through discussion to test label choices
73,34760950,"Team-Based Care for Improving Hypertension Management: A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.  Objective: We evaluated the effect on long term blood pressure (BP) of an interprofessional team-based care (TBC) intervention, involving nurses, pharmacists, and physicians, compared to usual care. Methods: We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled study in ambulatory clinics and community pharmacies in Switzerland (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02511093). Uncontrolled treated hypertensive patients were randomized to TBC or usual care (UC). In the TBC group, nurses and pharmacists met patients every 6 weeks to measure BP, assess lifestyle, support medication adherence, and provide health education for 6 months. After each visit, they wrote a report to the physician who could adjust antihypertensive therapy. The outcome was the intention-to-treat difference in mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) and control (<135/85 mmHg) at 6 and 12 months. Results: Eighty-nine patients (60 men/29 women; mean (SD) age: 61(12) year) were randomized to TBC (n = 43) or UC (n = 46). At baseline, mean (SD) BP was 144(10)/90(8) mmHg and 147(12)/87(11) mmHg in the TBC and UC groups. At 6 months, the between-groups difference in daytime systolic ABPM was-3 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI):-10 to +4; p = 0.45]; at 12 months, this difference was-7 mmHg [95% CI:-13 to-2; p = 0.01]. At 6 months, the between-groups difference in daytime diastolic ABPM was +2 mmHg [95% CI:-1 to +6; p = 0.20]; at 12 months, this difference was-2 mmHg [95% CI:-5 to +2; 0.42]. Upon adjustment for baseline covariates including baseline BP, the between-groups differences at 6 and 12 months were maintained. At 6 months, there was no difference in BP control. At 12 months, the TBC group tended to have a better control in systolic BP (p = 0.07) but not in diastolic BP (p = 0.33). Conclusion: While there was not significant effect on BP at 6 months of follow-up, the TBC intervention can help decrease long-term systolic BP among uncontrolled hypertensive patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND The role of the pharmacist in wound healing management among patients with diabetic and nondiabetic foot ulcers (DFU) is unclear. We sought to implement and evaluate an integrated pharmacist-driven comprehensive medication management (CMM) program in a multidisciplinary podiatrist-led wound healing center (WHC). OBJECTIVES The objectives were to determine the role of the clinical pharmacist in a WHC and evaluate the impact of CMM interventions on prescribing rates and wound healing rates. METHODS A pharmacist-driven CMM program was implemented in a podiatrist-led WHC, and an evaluation spanning 6 years was conducted. RESULTS Overall, 1018 patients were treated over 6 years, and 515 received wound treatment after the CMM period, of which, 309 received CMM services. A total of 441 medication related problems (MRPs) were identified; most were related to medication safety (35.1%) and inappropriate or ineffective therapy (31.3%), and problems with adherence accounted for 22.5% of documented MRPs. An average of 3.41 interventions per patient were documented, and most were related to patient education (40.8%). Only metformin (20.3 vs. 34.2%; P < 0.001) and insulin prescription (57.3 vs. 73.8%; P < 0.001) prevalence increased after CMM implementation. Other prescriptions were not significantly different among patients presenting in the pre- and post-CMM periods, respectively. Wound healing rates among patients with DFU were similar before and after implementation (55 vs. 52%; P = 0.49). Likewise, wound healing rates among those with non-DFUs were similar before- and after implementation (56 vs. 53%; P = 0.56). CONCLUSION The implementation of a novel pharmacist-driven CMM program embedded within a multidisciplinary podiatrist-managed WHC provided the initial evidence of the potential benefits of providing pharmacist-driven CMM services to patients with lower extremity ulcers.

76,34764035,"Prevalence of medically unsupervised activated charcoal use a cause for concern in celiac disease? BACKGROUND Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes an intolerance to gluten. Owing to hidden sources, lack of clear labeling, and cross-contamination, it is not uncommon for individuals with celiac disease to inadvertently ingest gluten. A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of activated charcoal use in celiac disease as a purported remedy despite the lack of literature on the safety and efficacy of the practice and to elucidate the manner in which using activated charcoal as a treatment for acute gluten ingestion is being communicated. METHODS Using a descriptive study design, a Web-based survey was sent to members of the celiac disease community via social media pages for voluntary participants 18 years and older diagnosed with celiac disease. Participants were stratified into 3 major groups: (1) those who had heard of using activated charcoal as a remedy to counteract gluten ingestion and used it, (2) those who had heard of using activated charcoal but had not used it, and (3) those who had not heard of using activated charcoal. RESULTS In subjects with celiac disease, 424 of 1613 respondents (26%) had heard of using activated charcoal as a potential remedy for gluten ingestion, and 12% had used it. The top source of information regarding any general information including remedies for maladies related to celiac disease was social media networks 72.3% (879/1613). Of those who had used activated charcoal, 122 participants (61.3%) reported subjectively feeling a reduced severity of symptoms.

Short-term medical missions (STMMs) have evolved in the past few decades to provide non-emergent care including routine and follow-up primary care for acute and chronic conditions, along with treatment of neglected tropical diseases. Many STMMs operate outside the local health care infrastructure and may have limited local partnerships. STMM outcomes in improving local population health are often inferred but not well documented. Concerns such as ethical conduct, provider bias, and lack of adequate training and preparation continue to be raised. When disruptions occur (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic), STMMs need to develop and prepare for challenges such as the inability to travel and provide care. Pharmacists as health professionals play a unique role when volunteering in STMMs. However, pharmacists' roles in STMMs need further development along with a framework to guide STMM work.

78,34764037,"The impact of community pharmacy utilization of immunization information systems on vaccination rates: Results of a clustered randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND Adult immunization rates in the United States remain low. More convenient access to immunization information systems (IIS) may improve vaccination rates. OBJECTIVE The objective of this multilevel, clustered, randomized controlled study was to measure the impact of providing pharmacists with software and training to query IIS for patient vaccine history/recommendations on adult influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, and Td/Tdap vaccination rates. METHODS California Rite Aid pharmacy districts were randomized into intervention/control groups using stratified randomization based on baseline influenza vaccination rates. Store demographic characteristics were collected at baseline (January 1-December 31, 2018). During follow-up (April 1, 2019-March 31, 2020), intervention group stores received access to ImmsLink, software that allows health care providers to review immunization records from IIS and identify a patient's recommended vaccinations. The difference-in-difference between intervention and control groups compared the changes in vaccination rates from baseline to follow-up by calculating adjusted ratios of risk ratios (RRRs). Analysis was performed at the store level. RESULTS Thirty-six districts comprising 501 Rite Aid stores (intervention: n = 244 stores; control: n = 257) were included. We found no significant differences in vaccination rates between groups: influenza, 19-64 years (adjusted RRR 0.99 [95% CI 0.83-1.17]); influenza, ≥65 years (1.02 [0.86-1.22]); herpes zoster (1.07 [0.90-1.28]); pneumococcal (0.95, 0.80-1.14); and Td/Tdap (0.88, 0.73-1.05). Reasons that recommended vaccines were not given in the intervention group included patient being deferred to future visit, patient declining, patient having already received the vaccination, patient declining because of cost, or vaccine being unavailable. Overall, pharmacist engagement with ImmsLink was low. CONCLUSION Providing pharmacists with software and training to query IIS did not improve vaccination rates compared with control pharmacies in this study. Factors such as an inconvenient interface or inadequate training or motivation may have caused low engagement with the software and should be considered in future interventions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

80,34764701,"Reviewing Potentially Inappropriate Medication in Hospitalized Patients Over 65 Using Explicit Criteria: A Systematic Literature Review.  Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) is a primary health concern affecting the quality of life of patients over 65. PIM is associated with adverse drug reactions including falls, increased healthcare costs, health services utilization and hospital admissions. Various strategies, clinical guidelines and tools (explicit and implicit) have been developed to tackle this health concern. Despite these efforts, evidence still indicates a high prevalence of PIM in the older adult population. This systematic review explored the practice of using explicit tools to review PIM in hospitalized patients and examined the outcomes of PIM reduction. A literature search was conducted in several databases from their inception to 2019. Original studies that had an interventional element using explicit criteria detecting PIM in hospitalized patients over 65 were included. Descriptive narrative synthesis was used to analyze the included studies. The literature search yielded 6116 articles; 25 quantitative studies were included in this systematic literature review. Twenty were prospective studies and five were retrospective. Approximately, 15,500 patients were included in the review. Various healthcare professionals were involved in reviewing PIM including physicians and hospital pharmacists. Several tools were used to review PIM for hospitalized patients over 65, most frequently Beer's criteria and the STOPP/START tool. The reduction of PIM ranged from 3.5% up to 87%. The most common PIM were benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. This systematic review showed promising outcomes in terms of improving patient outcomes. However, the reduction of PIM varied in the studies, raising the question of the variance between hospitals in the explicit tools used for review. Additional studies need to be conducted to further investigate the outcomes of reviewing PIM at different levels, as well as assessing the cost-effectiveness of using explicit tools in reducing PIM.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
81,34765250,"Antibiotic Resistance, Still a Global Challenge.  The use of antibiotics represents a major health problem worldwide because they are often administered without medical prescription. This has led to different situations starting from a large use in inappropriate cases without medical recommendation, to a major issue that represents antimicrobial resistance. Our aim was to identify the opinion of healthcare workers (physicians and pharmacists) about the most effective solution at reducing antimicrobial resistance, helping the policy makers to take a decision. The present study was conducted from March 15th, 2021 to April 15th, 2021, using a virtual questionnaire. A total of 397 respondents provided a complete response to our questionnaire: 313 physicians and 84 pharmacists. Our results provided valuable insights that can be used to inform the development of a national health policy, resulting in population health gains. Our work provided an indication of physicians' preferences toward solutions as ""A tax on antibiotic consumption, which could be used to fund innovation strategies."" (41.53%) and ""An educational program for patients that highlights the causes and effects of antimicrobial resistance."" (42.49%). The pharmacists preferred the solutions as ""An educational program for patients that highlights the causes and effects of antimicrobial resistance."" (52.38%) and ""Elimination of antibiotics from the list of the emergency pharmaceutical services."" (42.86%). A small number of physicians (2.24%) and pharmacists (3.57%) recommended as the most effective solution at reducing antimicrobial resistance ""Restrain antibiotic use in the food industry.""",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
82,34765519,"Early intervention with Kan Jang® to treat upper-respiratory tract infections: A randomized, quadruple-blind study. Background and aim Andrographis paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus preparations and their fixed combination, called Kan Jang®, are traditionally used for relieving symptoms of upper-respiratory tract infections (URTIs). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of early intervention with Kan Jang® on the relief and duration of inflammatory symptoms during the acute phase of the disease. Experimental procedure A total of 179 patients with URTI symptoms received six Kan Jang® (daily dose of andrographolides: 60 mg) or placebo capsules a day for five consecutive days in this randomized, quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-parallel-group phase II study. The primary efficacy outcomes were the decrease in the acute-phase duration and the mean URTI symptoms score (sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, hoarseness, cough, headache, and fatigue). Results Early intervention with Kan Jang® significantly increased the recovery rate and reduced the number of sick leave days by >21% (0.64/day) relative to that observed in the placebo group (2.38 vs. 3.02 days, p = 0.0053). Kan Jang® significantly alleviated all URTI symptoms starting from the second day of treatment. A superior anti-inflammatory effect of Kan Jang® to that of placebo was also observed on the white blood cell count (p = 0.007) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.0258). Treatment with Kan Jang® was tolerated well. Conclusion This study demonstrates that early intervention with Kan Jang® capsules reduces the recovery duration of patients by 21% and significantly relieves the severity of typical URTI symptoms.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Biologics are tremendously efficacious biological molecules that have enabled the treatment of many life-threatening diseases which have previously been hard to treat. Biosimilars, also known as 'follow-on biologics', are highly similar versions of another already approved biologic, called the Reference Product. The European Union has been a pioneer in the regulation of biosimilars. WHO guideline on evaluation of biosimilars published in 2009 was an important landmark in biosimilar regulations worldwide, and several countries have adopted its principles in the development of their own regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. Most countries in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region still lack official and scientific guidelines for biosimilar approval pathways. This article explores the regulatory situation of biosimilar registration pathways in Algeria and describes the progress made and the regulatory landscape changes for biosimilars in Algeria during the past ten years. Our findings indicate that the development of biosimilar regulation in Algeria went through three major phases between 2006 and 2021, during which there has been much progress in drafting guidance documents for biosimilars. Since 2016, Algeria has used the EMA, FDA and WHO guidelines as the basis for approval of several biosimilars and no national guidelines or regulations have been adopted to date. Additionally, there has been no regulation on substitution/interchangeability. The Algerian regulatory authority has gained considerable experience with approval and use of increasingly complex biosimilars over the past 5 years and has the potential to create its own biosimilar-specific regulatory pathway in the near future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
84,34769543,"Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Restraint Use in Aged Care.  Restraint use in Australian residential aged care has been highlighted by the media, and investigated by researchers, government and advocacy bodies. In 2018, the Royal Commission into Aged Care selected 'Restraint' as a key focus of inquiry. Subsequently, Federal legislation was passed to ensure restraint is only used in residential aged care services as the 'last resort'. To inform and develop Government educational resources, we conducted qualitative research to gain greater understanding of the experiences and attitudes of aged care stakeholders around restraint practice. Semi-structured interviews were held with 28 participants, comprising nurses, care staff, physicians, physiotherapists, pharmacists and relatives. Two focus groups were also conducted to ascertain the views of residential and community aged care senior management staff. Data were thematically analyzed using a pragmatic approach of inductive and deductive coding and theme development. Five themes were identified during the study: 1. Understanding of restraint; 2. Support for legislation; 3. Restraint-free environments are not possible; 4. Low-level restraint; 5. Restraint in the community is uncharted. Although most staff, health practitioners and relatives have a basic understanding of restraint, more education is needed at a conceptual level to enable them to identify and avoid restraint practice, particularly 'low-level' forms and chemical restraint. There was strong support for the new restraint regulations, but most interviewees admitted they were unsure what the legislation entailed. With regards to resources, stakeholders wanted recognition that there were times when restraint was necessary and advice on what to do in these situations, as opposed to unrealistic aspirations for restraint-free care. Stakeholders reported greater oversight of restraint in residential aged care but specified that community restraint use was largely unknown. Research is needed to investigate the extent and types of restraint practice in community aged care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
85,34770055,"Pharmacists' Perception of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study. OBJECTIVES To analyze the role of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, to measure pharmacists' attitude toward COVID-19 safety measures (wearing masks, wearing gloves, isolation shield, good hygiene, etc.), and explore their perspectives regarding a second wave of the virus. METHODS This cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak in July 2020 to discuss Jordanian pharmacists' awareness of safety at their workplace during the COVID-19 outbreak, their sources of information, and their predictions for COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS The participants (n = 311) were all pharmacists mostly aged between 23-30 years old (45%) and female (83%). The primary source of information about COVID-19 was social networking (38.9%). Pharmacists were committed to social distancing (86.5%) and wearing masks (76.2%). They expressed levels of agreement to their role in decreasing COVID-19 spread (94.2%) and correcting false information (94.5%); they expressed levels of expectation toward concern about a second COVID-19 wave (83%) that would be more severe than the previous one (43.4%). Pharmacists expected that an influenza vaccine might be helpful in decreasing severity and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (56.9%). Pharmacists expected COVID-19 vaccine development within 6 months of administering our study survey (84.9%) and that vaccination might be effective in preventing COVID-19 (93%) infection. CONCLUSION Pharmacists expressed positive roles on COVID-19 spread through exemplary actions, self-commitment to protection measures, and public health awareness. Social media as a source of health information should be cautiously investigated, and pharmacists should always refer to evidence-based sources. The role of pharmacists is particularly important for the upcoming era of COVID-19 vaccination administration and awareness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of the collaboration between oncology pharmacists and anaesthesiologists for improving pain control management in cancer patients. METHODS This retrospective case-control pilot study enrolled inpatients with active cancer and a pain score of >3 at least once per day for 3 consecutive days. The study group was selected from June 2018 to January 2019. Patients with the same inclusion criteria were selected between November 2017 and May 2018 to serve as the comparison group. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients that experienced pain relief within 7 days from initial pain attack. RESULTS A total of 71 and 77 patients were enrolled in the study and comparison groups. More patients in the study group experienced pain relief within 7 days from the index date (78.9% [56 of 71 patients] versus 72.7% [56 of 77 patients], respectively). The service increased the rate of intervention from attending physicians within 4 days from index date and quality of opioid management.

BACKGROUND Knowledge deficits with regard to epilepsy have been reported among healthcare professionals. This study was conducted to develop consensus-based aims, contents, intended learning outcomes, teaching, and evaluation methods for a course on epilepsy for postgraduate or continuing education in community health nursing programs. METHODS A mixed method which combined a thorough search of literature, the nominal group technique, the Delphi technique, and survey of students' agreement was used. The databases MEDLINE/PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE, CInAHL/EBESCO, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, Google Books, and Amazon were searched to identify potential aims, topics/contents, intended learning outcomes, teaching, and evaluation methods. Discussions and deliberations in serial meetings based on the nominal group technique were attended by educators/academicians (n = 12), neurologists (n = 2), practicing nurses (n = 5), pharmacists (n = 2), patients with epilepsy (n = 2), and students in postgraduate and continuing education programs (n = 7) to supplement and refine the data collected from the literature. The qualitative data were analyzed using RQDA tool for R. The Delphi technique was used among educators/academicians (n = 15), neurologists (n = 2), practicing nurses (n = 5), pharmacists (n = 2), patients with epilepsy (n = 3), and students in postgraduate and continuing education programs (n = 8) to achieve formal consensus. RESULTS Consensus was achieved on 6 aims, 16 intended learning outcomes, and 27 topics in the course. Of the topics, 13 were relevant to nature of epilepsy and seizures, 2 were relevant to the impact of epilepsy and seizures on different life aspects of patients with epilepsy, 4 were relevant to advocating for the patients and supporting their choices, 5 were relevant to educating patients and their caregivers, and 3 were relevant to assessments and services. CONCLUSION Consensus-based aims, topics/contents, intended learning outcomes, teaching, and evaluation methods of a course on epilepsy for postgraduate or continuing education in community health nursing programs were developed. Consensus-based courses could bridge knowledge gaps and improve educating community health nursing programs on epilepsy. Further studies are needed to determine if such consensus-based courses could promote care of patients with epilepsy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
88,34772632,"Curricular-driven screening for atrial fibrillation at community pharmacies. BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke. It can be asymptomatic and patients may be unaware they have AF. Therefore, there is a need to develop a sustainable community model to screen for unrecognized AF. OBJECTIVE The objective is to assess a curriculum driven model developed by the University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy (UNM-CoP) to evaluate AF screening at three community pharmacy sites. METHODS Screenings and education for AF were performed by fourth year pharmacy students during their advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) community rotation at pre-selected independent pharmacies. Patients were screened using the KardiaMobile device (AliveCor®, Mountain View, California), an FDA-cleared device that interprets a medical-grade ECG in 30 seconds. All screening materials and devices were provided by UNM-CoP. Semi-structured interviews with each targeted pharmacy were conducted to assess the logistics, value, and sustainability of the program (N=5 pharmacists). RESULTS AF assessment was performed over a 7-month period by 8 students at three pharmacies. Students screened a total of 63 patients (62% female, 56 ± 14 years of age) with 92% of the encounters taking less than 10 minutes to complete. Three patients (4.7%) were found to have possible AF. Positive scores were noted when assessing value to the pharmacy (8.8 ± 0.8, scale 1-10 with 10 being high value) and professionally (9.7 ± 0.6). DISCUSSION Student-pharmacists provides a likely pathway for sustainability for this clinical initiative and provides for a novel and measurable APPE patient interaction. CONCLUSION Curricular driven AF assessment in community pharmacies was shown to be a feasible model. Additional studies are needed to assess whether population-based real-time assessment and detection of AF can reduce the risk of stroke in previously undetected AF. If stroke reduction is realized, reimbursement for service is likely and can contribute to further sustainability.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Methotrexate is a folate analog prescribed for varying disease with weekly administration as opposed to daily. Dosing errors can prove clinically significant and sometimes fatal. METHODS We performed a retrospective poison center review of methotrexate calls between 2009 and 2019. RESULTS Of 111 human-related poison center calls, most patients taking methotrexate were women ages 41 to 80 years old and were prescribed methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Eighty-eight (79%), and 41 (36%) were admitted to the hospital. Thirty-one (75%) of hospitalized patients received leukovorin treatment for their exposure. Two patients died from methotrexate dosing errors. DISCUSSION Most methotrexate accidental ingestions reported to poison centers result from dose frequency errors. However, we note a higher incidence of unintentional therapeutic errors (79% vs 13.7%) than reported in the National Poison Data System in 2019. Patients are often hospitalized for lab monitoring, and many receive leucovorin. CONCLUSIONS Most methotrexate calls to our poison center resulted from taking the drug more often than prescribed. Efforts may focus on patient education, physician or pharmacist monitoring during initiation, improved dispensing devices, or weekly drug dispensing.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
91,34774041,"Pharmacists' and patients' perceptions about the importance of pharmacist services types to improve medication adherence among patients with diabetes in Indonesia. BACKGROUND Various pharmacist services are available to improve medication adherence, including consultation, brochure, etc. Challenges arise on which services are best implemented in practice. Knowledge about patients' and pharmacists' preferences can help to prioritize services. This study explores the pharmacists' and patients' perceptions about the importance of pharmacist services to improve medication adherence among patients with diabetes in Indonesia. METHODS This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study involved adult outpatients with diabetes type 2 and pharmacists from community health centers (CHCs) and hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia. Random sampling was used to identify 57 CHCs in the study. In addition, based on convenient sampling, three hospitals participated. All pharmacists working at the CHCs and hospitals, who were willing to participate, were included in the study. For patients, minimum sample size was calculated using Slovin's formula. Patients and pharmacists were asked to rank five pharmacist service types (consultation, brochure/leaflet, patient group discussion, medication review, and phone call refill reminder) according to their importance to improve medication adherence. A face validity test of the self-developed questionnaire was conducted before the data collection. Rank ordered probit models were estimated (STATA 15th software). RESULTS A total of 457 patients from CHCs, 579 patients from hospitals, and 99 pharmacists from both medical facilities were included. Consultation (CHC patients 56.0% vs hospital patients 39.7% vs pharmacists 75.2%) and brochure (CHC patients 23.2% vs hospital patients 27.5% vs pharmacists 11.9%) were the most preferred pharmacist services. Patients with experience getting medication information from pharmacists valued consultation higher than brochure and patient group discussions. Older patients ranked a brochure higher than other services. Patients without formal education in CHCs had a lower probability of giving a high rank to a brochure to improve medication adherence. There was significant positive correlation between the ranking of phone call refill reminder and medication review (0.6940) for patients in CHCs. CONCLUSION For both patients and pharmacists, consultation, brochure, and group discussion were the highest-ranked services.

92,34774044,"Healthcare professionals' perceptions on medication communication challenges and solutions - text mining and manual content analysis - cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Communication challenges contribute to medication incidents in hospitals, but it is unclear how communication can be improved. The aims of this study were threefold: firstly, to describe the most common communication challenges related to medication incidents as perceived by healthcare professionals across specialized hospitals for adult patients; secondly, to consider suggestions from healthcare professionals with regard to improving medication communication; and thirdly, to explore how text mining compares to manual analysis when analyzing the free-text content of survey data. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. A digital survey was sent to professionals in two university hospital districts in Finland from November 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020. In total, 223 professionals answered the open-ended questions; respondents were primarily registered nurses (77.7 %), physicians (8.6 %), and pharmacists (7.3 %). Text mining and manual inductive content analysis were employed for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS The communication challenges were: (1) inconsistent documentation of prescribed and administered medication; (2) failure to document orally given prescriptions; (3) nurses' unawareness of prescriptions (given outside of ward rounds) due to a lack of oral communication from the prescribers; (4) breaks in communication during care transitions to non-communicable software; (5) incomplete home medication reconciliation at admission and discharge; (6) medication lists not being updated during the inpatient period due to a lack of clarity regarding the responsible professional; and (7) work/environmental factors during medication dispensation and the receipt of verbal prescriptions. Suggestions for communication enhancements included: (1) structured digital prescriptions; (2) guidelines and training on how to use documentation systems; (3) timely documentation of verbal prescriptions and digital documentation of administered medication; (4) communicable software within and between organizations; (5) standardized responsibilities for updating inpatients' medication lists; (6) nomination of a responsible person for home medication reconciliation at admission and discharge; and (7) distraction-free work environment for medication communication. Text mining and manual analysis extracted similar primary results. CONCLUSIONS Non-communicable software, non-standardized medication communication processes, lack of training on standardized documentation, and unclear responsibilities compromise medication safety in hospitals. Clarification is needed regarding interdisciplinary medication communication processes, techniques, and responsibilities. Text mining shows promise for free-text analysis.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
93,34774088,"Do health policies address the availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of human resources for health? Analysis over three decades of National Health Policy of India. BACKGROUND Human Resources for Health (HRH) are crucial for improving health services coverage and population health outcomes. The World Health Organisation (WHO) promotes countries to formulate holistic policies that focus on four HRH dimensions-availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality (AAAQ). The status of these dimensions and their incorporation in the National Health Policies of India (NHPIs) are not well known. METHODS We created a multilevel framework of strategies and actions directed to improve AAAQ HRH dimensions. HRH-related recommendations of NHPI-1983, 2002, and 2017 were classified according to targeted dimensions and cadres using the framework. We identified the dimensions and cadres focussed by NHPIs using the number of mentions. Furthermore, we introduce a family of dimensionwise deficit indices formulated to assess situational HRH deficiencies for census years (1981, 2001, and 2011) and over-year trends. Finally, we evaluated whether or not the HRH recommendations in NHPIs addressed the deficient cadres and dimensions of the pre-NHPI census years. RESULTS NHPIs focused more on HRH availability and quality compared to accessibility and acceptability. Doctors were prioritized over auxiliary nurses-midwives and pharmacists in terms of total recommendations. AAAQ indices showed deficits in all dimensions for almost all HRH cadres over the years. All deficit indices show a general decreasing trend from 1981 to 2011 except for the accessibility deficit. The recommendations in NHPIs did not correspond to the situational deficits in many instances indicating a policy priority mismatch. CONCLUSION India needs to incorporate AAAQ dimensions in its policies and monitor their progress. The framework and indices-based approach can help identify the gaps between targeted and needed dimensions and cadres for effective HRH strengthening. At the global level, the application of framework and indices will allow a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of HRH-related policies of various nations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
94,34774104,"Effects of naringenin supplementation in overweight/obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: study protocol for a randomized double-blind clinical trial. INTRODUCTION Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds, have garnered a great deal of attention in the management of NAFLD because of their profitable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress which are the pivotal pathophysiological pathways in NAFLD. Naringenin is a citrus-derived flavonoid with a broad spectrum of potential biological effects including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may exert protective effects against NAFLD. The present clinical trial aims to examine the efficacy of naringenin supplementation on plasma adiponectin and neurogulin-4 (NRG-4) concentrations, metabolic parameters, and liver function indices in overweight/obese patients with NAFLD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study that will investigate the impacts of naringenin supplementation in overweight/obese patients with NAFLD. Liver ultrasonography will be applied to diagnose NAFLD. Forty-four eligible overweight/obese subjects with NAFLD will be selected and randomly assigned to receive naringenin capsules or identical placebo (each capsule contains 100 mg of naringenin or cellulose), twice daily for 4 weeks. Participants will be asked to remain on their usual diet and physical activity. Safety of naringenin supplementation was confirmed by the study pharmacist. The primary outcome of this study is changes in adiponectin circulating levels. The secondary outcomes include changes in NRG-4 levels, liver function indices, metabolic parameters, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, and hematological parameters. Statistical analysis will be conducted using the SPSS software (version 25), and P value less than 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. DISCUSSION We hypothesize that naringenin administration may be useful for treating NAFLD by modulating energy balance, glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation through different mechanisms. The current trial will exhibit the effects of naringenin, whether negative or positive, on NAFLD status. ETHICAL ASPECTS The current trial received approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (IR.TUMS.MEDICNE.REC.1399.439).

95,34774397,"Implementation of buprenorphine initiation and warm handoff protocols in emergency departments: A qualitative study of Pennsylvania hospitals. BACKGROUND Emergency departments (ED) are a critical touchpoint for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). In 2019, Pennsylvania had the fifth highest drug overdose mortality rate in the United States. State efforts have focused on implementing evidence-based ED care protocols, including induction of buprenorphine and warm handoffs to community treatment. OBJECTIVE We examined hospital staff's perspectives on the processes, challenges, and facilitators to buprenorphine initiation and warm handoff protocols in the ED. METHODS We used a qualitative case study design to focus on six Pennsylvania hospitals. The study selected hospitals using purposive sampling to capture varying hospital size, rurality, teaching status, and phase of protocol implementation. The study staff interviewed hospital staff with key roles in OUD care delivery in the ED, which included administrators, physicians, nurses, recovery support professionals, care coordinators, a social worker, and a pharmacist. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with 21 key informants from June to November 2020. Interviews were transcribed, deductively coded, and analyzed using CFIR domains and constructs to summarize factors influencing implementation of OUD ED care protocols and warm handoff to care protocols, as well as suggestions that emerged between and across cases. RESULTS Despite variation in the local context between hospitals, we identified common themes that influenced buprenorphine and warm handoffs across sites. Attention to hospital OUD care through state-level initiatives like the Hospital Quality Improvement Program generated hospital leadership buy-in toward implementing best OUD care practices. Factors at the hospital-level that influenced implementation success included supporting interdisciplinary OUD care champions, addressing knowledge gaps and biases around patients with OUD, having data systems that capture OUD care and integrate clinical protocols, incorporating patient comorbidities and non-medical needs into care, and fostering community provider linkages and capacity for warm handoffs. Although themes were largely consistent among hospital and staff types, protocol implementation was tailored by each hospital's size, patient volume, and hospital and community resources. CONCLUSIONS By understanding frontline staff's perspectives around factors that impact OUD care practices in the ED, stakeholders may better optimize implementation efforts.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
96,34774424,"Advancing Mental heaLth Provision In PHarmacY (AMPLIPHY): A feasibility study. BACKGROUND Specifically-designed community pharmacy-based services represent opportunities to support people with their mental health. As few such services exist worldwide, the Advancing Mental HeaLth Provision In PharmacY (AMPLIPHY) was designed with stakeholders. The purpose was to support people with their mental health when initiated on new prescription or change in drug, dose or quantity of antidepressant, through a series of consultations (up to 3 months). OBJECTIVE(S) The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of the AMPLIPHY service. The objectives were to: i) pilot the service; ii) examine anonymous consultation data to understand patients' characteristics, priorities and consultation focus and iii) Evaluate pharmacists' experiences. METHODS This service evaluation involved a concurrent mixed methods design. Patient characteristics were extracted from consultation notes and descriptive statistics applied. Content analysis was used to summarise consultation foci and comparisons between patients' priorities with consultation content were made. Pharmacists were interviewed at the start (n = 10) and end (n = 4) of the pilot with themes identified using thematic analysis. RESULTS Seventy-six patients participated (63% of recruitment target). The median age was 39 (IQR 28-47) and 62% were female. Seventy percent of patients had one consultation, 26% had two and 4% had three. Prescription for new antidepressant was the most common reason for entry (74%) and sertraline was most prescribed (46%). Consultations commonly focussed on life experience (n = 51), medication (n = 47), health (n = 42), support (n = 36) and patients' expression of their feelings (n = 31). The pharmacists' experiences were summarised in three themes: i) Motivation, ii) Practicalities and iii) Experience and Outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists were motivated to deliver this novel service and some patients were willing to join the service. Analysis of patient demographics, consultation notes and interviews provide insight into the strengths and challenges of the service and provides a blueprint for future service developments.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
97,34775244,"Stakeholder perceptions of community pharmacist population health management of people living with epilepsy. OBJECTIVE To identify the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors influencing the integration of community pharmacists in population health approaches to epilepsy care. METHODS Key informant interviews were conducted with 32 stakeholders, including five people living with epilepsy (PWE), ten caregivers of PWE, seven epileptologists, one neurologist, one epilepsy nurse, and eight community pharmacists in Washington State and Oregon from September 2019 to February 2020. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a rapid content analysis approach guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model to identify predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors influencing integration of community pharmacists in population health approaches to epilepsy care. RESULTS Four predisposing, four enabling, three positive reinforcing factors, and two negative reinforcing factors emerged as influencing integration of community pharmacists in a population health approach to epilepsy care across all stakeholder groups. Predisposing factors included patient advocacy, medication adherence, medication monitoring, and medication education. Enabling factors were a shared vision, collaboration structure, efficient communication, and pharmacist attributes (knowledge, experience, and attitude). Positive reinforcing factors included a team approach, easy to access support, and medication adherence. Negative reinforcing factors were duplicate or conflicting care and limited time and resources. SIGNIFICANCE This study identified several predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors influencing integration of community pharmacists in population health approaches to epilepsy care based on stakeholder perceptions.

99,34775527,"Single pharmacy governed denosumab home administration: optimal adherence by means of a fracture liaison service (FLS) and home care collaboration.  Low adherence for denosumab (Dmab, Prolia®) is of major concern. Dutch pharmacies deliveries were calculated recently being 76.5% for a total of 3 injections. INTRODUCTION Comparing a model where the prescriber maintains responsibility for adherence (model HC1) (Dmab is purchased and dispensed by patient's own community pharmacy and administered through a home care service (HC)) or an all-in-one model where the pharmacist maintains responsibility for the adherence (Dmab is purchased, dispensed, and administered by a pharmacist's HC) (HC2). METHODS We counted the number of Dmab injections, follow-up appointments on time, Dmab administrations delayed to a maximum of 60 days, the number of Dmab discontinuations, and all causes legally traceable under EU privacy act (EDPR). RESULTS Home care started by 2014 (study closure in 2021) and included 711 Dmab injections to 256 unique patients: HC1: 536 and HC2: 175 orders. The whole group received on average 2.8 Dmab injections by consistent intervals of about 182 days. Average administration after the latest Dmab injection: 272.8 days (HC1: 362.0 and HC2: 124.0 days). Administration of a subsequent injection > 60 days occurred in 26.6% (HC1: 38.8% and HC2: 6.2%; OR = 9.49). After adjustment for no more than three Dmab injections administered per patient, it occurred in 27.3% (HC1: 51.8% and HC2 4.4%; OR = 23.34). CONCLUSION It was possible to achieve 94% adherence for Dmab injections treatment just by transferring the complete supply chain to one pharmacy-initiated home care provider after treatment initiation by either a physician or FLS health care professional.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,Established through discussion to test label choices,,,Community,Established through discussion to test label choices
100,34775858,"Development and use of an innovative Gap Finding Tool to create Pharmaceutical Care Model within a paediatric oncology setting. INTRODUCTION A paediatric cancer ward is a setting where pharmacists participate in direct patient care, acting as coordinators between the patient, caregivers and healthcare professionals. The aim of the study was to develop a Gap Finding Tool to support the setting up of a pharmaceutical care model at a Paediatric-Adolescent Cancer Ward. METHODS The Standards of Practice for Clinical Pharmacy Services by the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Committee of Specialty Practice in Clinical Pharmacy (2013), the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (2014) and the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists (2014) were used to compile the Gap Finding Tool. The developed Tool was tested for content validity by a panel of experts and subsequently implemented over 2 months. RESULTS The Gap Finding Tool comprised of nine sections with an average of eight statements each about pharmacy services that should be provided at ward level. For each statement, the rater indicates whether these contributions are provided. When the Tool was implemented at the Paediatric-Adolescent Cancer Ward, four major gaps were identified, namely, absence of a clinical pharmacist, lack of medicines information, vetting of chemotherapy prescriptions by pharmacist with limited access to patient data and lack of pharmacist-input on medicines availability. Processes requiring optimisation included discharge medication advice and documentation processes. CONCLUSION The developed Gap Finding Tool is an innovative tool which is versatile and can be used in ward or ambulatory clinical settings to identify gaps in pharmaceutical processes and services and compare national or regional practices to international standards.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
101,34776255,"Parental self-medication with antibiotics in a Tunisian pediatric center. INTRODUCTION Self-medication of antibiotics among children is a very common problem in Tunisia. Its prevalence isn't well established. The aims of this study are to evaluate parents' knowledge concerning antibiotic use, and identify the factors associated with this problem. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study over a one year period (between August 2019 and July 2020). Data collection was performed using a questionnaire guided interview. We included parents of children consulting or hospitalized in the pediatric department of the university hospital Taher Sfar in Mahdia. RESULTS A total of 354 parents were included with an average age of 36.4±9.2 years. The average knowledge score was 2±1.3 points. In fact, 61.6% of the parents had poor knowledge about antibiotics. The frequency of non-prescription antibiotics use among children was 20.6%. Amoxicillin was the most used antibiotic (72.6%). Sore throat, important fever and flu-like symptoms were the main symptoms justifying non-prescription antibiotic use among our pediatric population in 60.3%, 34.2% and 23.3% of cases respectively. The main reason of self-medication was the fact that the same antibiotic was once prescribed to treat the same symptoms (58.9%). The used antibiotic came from an old prescription for the same child in 57.5% of the cases and was recommended by the pharmacist in 39.7% of the cases. After multivariate analysis, the factors associated with parental self-medication with antibiotics were: the advanced parent's age, the ability to name an antibiotic and knowledge's score>2. CONCLUSION Our study confirmed that parental knowledge about antibiotic use is low. In fact, the government should from one hand, organize antibiotic delivery and prohibit off the counter sells and in the other hand promote the education of the public through different procedures to stop this major health problem.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
102,34776262,"Louis Tanquerel des Planches (1810-1862) and the history of discovering lead poisoning in the nervous system.  Louis Tanquerel des Planches (1810-1862) only left us with one significant medical work, his Traité des maladies de plomb ou saturnines (treatise on lead or saturnine diseases), published in 1839. The work served as a reference for diagnosing and treating lead poisoning throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. The word ""encephalopathy"" that he coined at that time referred to toxic damage to the central nervous system. Whereas for two millennia and for most physicians, lead poisoning was considered lead colic, i.e. paroxysms of abdominal pain, Tanquerel collected seventy-two observations of damage to the central nervous system in workers exposed to lead in Parisian workshops (which no longer exist). He then inventoried and described forms of paralysis, delirium, coma, and convulsions related to lead poisoning. Having no qualms about stepping away from La Charité Hospital where he had treated patients with lead poisoning, he inspected their workplaces and unambiguously presented the deplorable conditions that caused so many patients to die. His ""preservative"" advice was an initial attempt at medical-social prophylaxis with the goal of helping the working class exposed in workshops without any respect for human life. With support from chemists and pharmacists, Tanquerel showed the presence of lead in brain tissue and thus demonstrated its neurological toxicity as early as 1839. This article is also an opportunity to note the contributions on this topic of some other physicians: François-de-Paule Combalusier (1713-1762), François Victor Mérat de Vaumartoise (1780-1851), Jean-Louis Brachet (1789-1858), Auguste Mirande (1802-1865), Vincent Nivet (1809-1893), Augustin Grisolle (1811-1869), and Ferdinand de Bernard de Montessus (1817-1899).",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
103,34776338,"Effects of home medication review on drug-related problems and health-related quality of life among community-dwelling older adults in China. BACKGROUND There is a lack of research on the nature of drug-related problems (DRPs) in older adult communities in China and the impact of home medication review on DRP reduction and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) improvement. OBJECTIVES To identify and categorize DRPs in older adults in China and to assess the impact of home medication review. METHODS The prospective study was conducted in 2 community health service centers in Shanghai, China from December 2018 to December 2019. Eligible patients received a home medication review by a clinical pharmacist to assess for DRPs and adherence, propose pharmaceutical interventions, and measure outcomes of HRQoL. All enrolled patients were followed up for 3 months. RESULTS Medication use in 412 patients was analyzed. A total of 362 DRPs were identified, an average of 0.88 per patient. Treatment effectiveness was the primary DRP type (249; 68.8%). The most common causes of DRPs were patient-related (35.1%) and drug selection (31.0%). Pharmacists made 733 interventions, an average of 2 per DRP. A total of 82.1% of these interventions were accepted. At a 3-month follow-up, home medication review led to a statistically significant reduction in the mean number of DRPs (0.4 vs. 0.88, P < 0.001) and an increase in medication adherence (1.42 vs. 0.85, P < 0.001). Both HRQoL indicators also improved, EuroQol 5 Dimension scale (0.75 vs. 0.78, P < 0.001) and EuroQol-visual analog scale (70 vs. 77.65, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Home medication review is a practical means to optimize drug therapy and improve patients' HRQoL in community settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

109,34777646,"Impact of a ""Pharmacist First"" innovative workflow plan in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.  Usual community pharmacy workflow, whereby patients might see a pharmacist at the end of the dispensing process, is not conducive to proactive patient-centred care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the ""Pharmacist First"" (P1st) workflow model on blood pressure and glycemic control in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes. This retrospective review was set in 2 community pharmacies that use the P1st model in the Greater Edmonton Region. The population entailed patients with hypertension and/or type 1 or 2 diabetes who received care via the P1st workflow model. The P1st workflow model places the patient in immediate contact with the pharmacist. The pharmacist first assesses prescription appropriateness, reviews relevant laboratory tests, discusses chronic disease control and addresses any questions or concerns the patient has before passing the prescription to be filled by a technician. This allows issues or concerns to be identified and addressed up front, rather than waiting until the prescription is filled and the patient is ready to leave the pharmacy. The primary outcome assessed in this study was change in blood pressure and/or A1C from baseline to the last follow-up visit. We reviewed 215 patient records. The mean age was 69.4 years (standard deviation 12.5), 51.2% of patients were male, 57.7% had hypertension, 5.6% had diabetes, and 36.7% had both. Median follow-up time was 4.2 months (interquartile range 2.5-9.3). In 203 patients with hypertension, systolic blood pressure was reduced from 139.83 mmHg to 131.26 mmHg (p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure from 80.26 mmHg to 76.86 mmHg (p < 0.001). In 87 patients with diabetes, A1C changed from 7.4% to 7.2% (p = ns). The P1st workflow model demonstrated significant improvements in blood pressure. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this model with a control group, longer follow-up and evaluation of the patient experience.",0,0,1,1,0,no control group,,,,,,,,,
110,34777650,"Pharmacists' perceptions of the Canadian opioid regulatory exemptions on patient care and opioid stewardship. Background This study explored the perceptions of Canadian pharmacists about the barriers and facilitators of providing opioid stewardship activities in pharmacy practice, considering the subsection 56(1) class exemption under Health Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Methods Qualitative key informant telephone interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of pharmacists from across Canada. We included community or primary health care team-based pharmacists who self-identified as having experience with providing care for patients using opioids via the exemptions. All transcripts were de-identified, and thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes. Ethics approval was obtained. Results Twenty pharmacists from community and primary health care teams, from all provinces and from urban and rural practices were interviewed. The following themes emerged: 1) optimization of opioid-related patient care, 2) jurisdictional impact and 3) awareness and education. Barriers and facilitators for opioid stewardship activities were identified. Discussion The exemptions facilitated the pharmacists' ability to provide opioid stewardship and positively affect patient care by providing continuity of and timely access to care. Our research demonstrated that pharmacists can responsibly and independently manage opioid prescriptions within this expanded scope, demonstrating the valuable contribution pharmacists can have in opioid stewardship. Conclusion Pharmacists were willing and able to care for patients receiving opioid medication and thereby played a role in helping address the opioid crisis. The benefits of these exemptions were demonstrated beyond situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and warrant consideration for consistent implementation across provincial and territorial jurisdictions, thereby ensuring equitable access to care for all Canadians.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
111,34778137,"Estimated Manipulation of Tablets and Capsules to Meet Dose Requirements for Chinese Children: A Cross-Sectional Study.  Objectives: To estimate the frequency of manipulations of all tablets and capsules prescribed for children in a teaching and tertiary children's hospital in China over the course of 1 month. Moreover, hypothetical reduction of manipulation according to the availability of low-strength tablets/capsules licensed by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (CNMPA) was evaluated. Methods: Information on all tablets and capsules prescribed in the hospital from March 17 to April 16, 2019 was collected. It was assumed that tablets or capsules were manipulated if the prescribed dose would have required only a proportion of the intact dose form. Manipulation typically includes splitting or crushing tablets, opening capsules and dispersing in water, or combinations of these method. Moreover, we defined an ""avoidable manipulation,"" when the dose could be rounded and/or when alternative products with a reduced strength or in liquid formulation were available in the hospital, and a ""inappropriate manipulation,"" which involved manipulated medications with a direct contraindication for any manipulation, such as those with a narrow therapeutic index or hazardous ingredients, or modified release dosage-forms. The frequencies of total, avoidable, and inappropriate manipulation were estimated, along with the hypothetical reduction of manipulation according to the availability of CNMPA-approved drug doses. Results: A total of 17,123 prescriptions for 142 medications were identified to have required a manipulation among 78,366 prescriptions administered during the study period, with 43 different proportions of subdivisions, ranging from a 19/20 to 1/180 product strength reduction. Half, quarter, and trisection were the most common subdivisions administered. Overall, 19% of the manipulated prescriptions were determined to be avoidable, and 19% of the manipulations involved medications with a clear recommendation to not manipulate. In addition, 21% of the manipulated prescriptions could have been potentially avoided if all of the approved preparations with the lowest strength would have been available at the hospital. Any manipulations undertaken were carried out by pharmacists and family care givers. Conclusions: More than 20% of tablets and capsules prescriptions need manipulated, included a high incidence of avoidable and inappropriate manipulation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
112,34779653,"Best Practices for Education and Training of Resuscitation Teams for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.  Background: Survival outcomes following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) vary significantly across hospitals. Research suggests clinician education and training may play a role. We sought to identify best practices related to the education and training of resuscitation teams. Methods: We conducted a descriptive qualitative analysis of semi-structured interview data obtained from in-depth site visits conducted from 2016-2017 at 9 diverse hospitals within the American Heart Association ""Get With The Guidelines"" registry, selected based on IHCA survival performance (5 top-, 1 middle-, 3 low-performing). We assessed coded data related to education and training including systems learning, informal feedback and debrief, and formal learning through ACLS and mock codes. Thematic analysis was used to identify best practices. Results: In total, 129 interviews were conducted with a variety of hospital staff including nurses, chaplains, security guards, respiratory therapists, physicians, pharmacists, and administrators, yielding 78 hours and 29 minutes of interview time. Four themes related to training and education were identified: engagement, clear communication, consistency, and responsive leadership. Top-performing hospitals encouraged employee engagement with creative marketing of new programs and prioritizing hands-on learning over passive didactics. Clear communication was accomplished with debriefing, structured institutional review, and continual, frequent education for departments. Consistency was a cornerstone to culture change and was achieved with uniform policies for simulation practice as well as reinforced, routine practice (weekly, monthly, quarterly). Finally, top-performing hospitals had responsive leadership teams across multiple disciplines (nursing, respiratory therapy, pharmacy and medicine), who listened and adapted programs to fit the needs of their staff. Conclusions: Among top-performing hospitals excelling in IHCA survival, we identified core elements for education and training of resuscitation teams. Developing tools to expand these areas for hospitals may improve IHCA outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
113,34780261,"GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism among North Indian lung cancer patients treated using monotherapy and poly-pharmacy. BACKGROUND Genetic polymorphism within the P1 isoenzyme of the Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) family is found to modulate and alter the enzyme activity of GSTP1 protein and thus may result in a change of sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. We investigated the relationship between GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms and overall survival, treatment response, and for both hematological and non-hematological toxicity of advanced North Indian lung cancer patients undergoing platinum-based double chemotherapy. METHODS The polymorphism of GSTP1 Ile105Val in North Indian lung cancer patients was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A total of 682 lung cancer patients were enrolled in the study, and it was observed that patients who were carrying both the mutant alleles (Val/Val) for the GSTP1 polymorphism showed a higher trend of median survival time (MST) as compared to the patients bearing the wild type of genotype (Ile/Ile) (MST = 8.30 vs. 7.47, p = 0.56). Based on toxicity profiling, we observed that lung cancer patients with the mutant genotype of GSTP1 (Val/Val) had an increased risk of leukopenia (OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.39-4.18, p = 0.001) as compared to subjects carrying both copies of the wild alleles (Ile/Ile). Our data suggested that patients with heterozygous genotype (Ile/Val) had a 2.14-fold increased risk of developing severe anemia (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 0.97-4.62, p = 0.03). Our data also showed that in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) patients' polymorphism of GSTP1 was associated with thrombocytopenia (χ2 test = 7.32, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism could be a predictive biomarker for hematological toxicity, like leukopenia and anemia, but not thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

116,34782042,"QTc-time-prolongating drugs and additional risk factors for long-QT-syndrome at hospital admission of surgical patients - risk assessment by pharmacists.  Drugs can cause long-QTc-syndrome (LQTS), thereby elevating the risk for palpitations, syncopes, and sudden cardiac death. Additional risk factors such as the intake of more than one QTc-prolongating drug (QTPD) and surgery (cardiac and non-cardiac) increase the risk considerably. Therefore, a good knowledge of patientś perioperative risk is important. Data concerning this issue in surgical patients is, however, scarce. We aimed to determine the number of surgical patients taking QTPD at hospital admission and to assess the presence of additional risk factors for LQTS. In addition, we determined the LQTS-risk at hospital admission by calculating the Tisdale Risk Score, enabling early detection of patients at risk. In a retrospective study, the pre-hospital medication of a 4-month cohort of surgical patients admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital was evaluated for QTPD-intake. For these patients, additional risk factors for LQTS were assessed and the Tisdale Risk Score was calculated. Of 837 surgical patients, 419 (50%) took at least one QTPD. In total, 3,376 drugs were taken and 723 (21%) classified as QTPD with a median number of 2 (range 1-8) per patient. The median number of LQTS-risk factors for these patients at hospital admission was 2 (range 0-5). The Tisdale Risk Score classified 23 patients (5%) as high, 187 (45%) as moderate, and 209 (50%) as low risk. These findings indicate a high number of surgical patients with QTPD and additional risk factors. The Tisdale Risk Score can be used as a screening instrument for patients at risk for QTc-prolongation during medication reconciliation by pharmacists at hospital admission. Patients identified as high and moderate risk should be evaluated for adjustable risk factors and monitored adequately. Medical treatment needs to be chosen carefully in view of in-hospital patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
117,34782755,"Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guideline for the gene-drug interaction between CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 and SSRIs.  The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guideline presented here, presents the gene-drug interaction between the genes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 and antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor type (SSRIs). Both genes' genotypes are translated into predicted normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), poor metabolizer (PM), or ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM). Evidence-based dose recommendations were obtained, based on a structured analysis of published literature. In CYP2C19 PM patients, escitalopram dose should not exceed 50% of the normal maximum dose. In CYP2C19 IM patients, this is 75% of the normal maximum dose. Escitalopram should be avoided in UM patients. In CYP2C19 PM patients, citalopram dose should not exceed 50% of the normal maximum dose. In CYP2C19 IM patients, this is 70% (65-75%) of the normal maximum dose. In contrast to escitalopram, no action is needed for CYP2C19 UM patients. In CYP2C19 PM patients, sertraline dose should not exceed 37.5% of the normal maximum dose. No action is needed for CYP2C19 IM and UM patients. In CYP2D6 UM patients, paroxetine should be avoided. No action is needed for CYP2D6 PM and IM patients. In addition, no action is needed for the other gene-drug combinations. Clinical effects (increase in adverse events or decrease in efficacy) were lacking for these other gene-drug combinations. DPWG classifies CYP2C19 genotyping before the start of escitalopram, citalopram, and sertraline, and CYP2D6 genotyping before the start of paroxetine as ""potentially beneficial"" for toxicity/effectivity predictions. This indicates that genotyping prior to treatment can be considered on an individual patient basis.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
118,34782878,"Hepatitis medical care coordinators: Comprehensive and seamless support for patients with hepatitis.  Chronic liver disease, especially viral hepatitis, is an urgent issue in Japan. Human resource management is important to promote appropriate care for patients with chronic liver disease in medical institutions and in the community. In 2011 the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan started training hepatitis medical care coordinators (HMCCs). Various medical professionals (such as public health nurses, general nurses, and clinical technicians), patients, and ordinary citizens are certified as HMCCs by the prefectural government after learning about liver diseases in a training program. The training program can be optimized in accordance with the regional circumstances and basic knowledge and skills of the applicants. HMCCs encourage residents and patients to undergo a hepatitis screening test, after which positive patients undergo detailed examination, treatment, and follow-up. HMCCs contribute to the expansion of knowledge about hepatitis in their workplace and community. By 2018, there were HMCCs in all 47 prefectures of Japan. There were 20,049 HMCCs in 2019. The most common professions of HMCCs were public health nurses, followed by general nurses, hospital pharmacists, laboratory technicians, and medical social workers.

INTRODUCTION Ambulatory chemotherapy is an important and major advance in clinical oncology practice since it allows the administration of chemotherapy in the comfort of the patient's home without the assistance of a health professional by means of an elastomeric pump. However, these pumps are not without risks and can be the cause of incidents due to technical failures. Our objective is to study the technical failures of elastomeric pumps in the Cytotoxic Preparation Unit and in the patient's home, to evaluate the possible impact of these failures on the patient and on the staff and to propose measures to reduce them. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study conducted at the pharmacy of the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat. It gathered all the specific reports on elastomeric pumps issued during the period (January 2017-May 2021) by the cytotoxic preparation unit to the materiovigilance cell via a notification form. RESULTS 205 cases of elastomeric pump materialovigilance were identified during the study period. The main technical failures were: chemotherapy product leakage (44%), flow rate anomalies (30%) and injection difficulties (20%). Following these incidents, certain actions were undertaken such as alerts sent to the supplier and letters sent to the competent health authorities. CONCLUSION Despite the failures that may have occurred, elastomeric pumps have revolutionized home chemotherapy delivery.

121,34784959,"Barriers and facilitators for integration of guidelines on operating health shops: a case of family planning services. BACKGROUND The Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority (ZAMRA) piloted the implementation of Guidelines on Operating Health Shops in Zambia in 2016, with a view to making basic medicines more accessible to communities. The guidelines aim to transform ordinary drug shops into health shops, which are dispensing facilities permitted to sell a ZAMRA-prescribed list of medicines over the counter. However, studies that explore the integration and uptake of guidelines into the health system are lacking. This study aims to inform future improved implementation of these guidelines by examining the current acceptability of guidelines within the Zambian health system, especially in relation to family planning services. METHODOLOGY Data collected through documentary review, key informant interviews with district pharmacists, staff from ZAMRA and in-depth interviews with 24 health shop owners and dispensers were analyzed using thematic analysis. A conceptual framework on the integration of health innovations into health systems guided the analysis. RESULTS The Guidelines on Operating Health Shops were implemented to address the problem of inadequate access to quality medicines especially in rural areas. Factors that facilitated the acceptability of the guidelines included their perceived relevance and simplicity, comprehensive training and improved knowledge among health shop operators on the guidelines, development of a governance and reporting structure or steering committee at the national level as well as perceived improved health outcomes at the community level. Factors that hindered acceptability of the guidelines included the high cost of implementing them, a restricted list of drugs which affected consumer choice, limited communication between the local council and the operators of health shops, health shop owners not owning the health shop premises restricting their ability to adapt the building, and cultural norms which constrained uptake of family planning services. CONCLUSION In addition to training, facilitating the acceptability of the guidelines among health shop owners requires paying attention to operational issues such as location, ownership of the shop, size of infrastructure as well as financial costs of implementing guidelines through decentralizing the registration process and thus reducing the cost of registration. It is also important to have effective communication strategies between operators and the regulators of health shops.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective The primary objective of this study is to gain an understanding of student pharmacist learning occurring during international advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). The secondary objective is to direct the development of suitable pre-departure orientation activities for pharmacy students.Methods University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy students authored blogs between 2012 and 2019 describing patient-care and non-patient care international APPEs. Investigators utilized inductive thematic analysis to analyze the blogs and define codes, categories, and themes from the data set. The entire data set was utilized to generate changes for pre-departure orientation.Results. The analysis included 47 blogs from which seven pictorial codes and 24 text codes were isolated from the data set to ultimately form four categories: Learning About Health care; My Surroundings; Logistics; and Me, Myself, and I. Two overall themes emerged from the codes and categories: Everything is Different and Here's What I Think and Feel. Examination of the data in conjunction with review of other studies focusing on study abroad demonstrated that the themes isolated in this study parallel previously described benefits of study abroad. Additionally, analysis of the blogs suggested expansion of pre-departure orientation for students and follow-up discussion to ensure understanding may be required prior to travel.Conclusion: This study gives a unique insight into thoughts and relative importance of pharmacy student experiences during study abroad.

Twenty two percent of preceptors reported scores consistent with burnout, with 57% of preceptors scoring positive for burnout in one of the three burnout criteria. On multivariate regression analysis, two independent risk factors for burnout syndrome were identified; preceptors who precepted a large number of difficult or unmotivated learners per year, and preceptors who did not feel their contributions as preceptors were appreciated by their institution.Conclusion. The rate of burnout among pharmacy preceptors is high, with preceptors exhibiting high EE and low levels of PA. Precepting a large number of difficult or unmotivated learners, and not feeling contributions as preceptors are appreciated, appear to be predictors of burnout syndrome.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
124,34785499,"Evaluating the Pre-Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam and Other Factors Associated with Performance on the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam.  Objective. To evaluate the relationship between the Pre-Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) and MPJE among pharmacy graduates and determine the influence of demographic, pre-pharmacy, and pharmacy school factors on MPJE outcomes.Methods. A retrospective review of pharmacy graduates' (n=156) MPJE scores, Pre-MPJE scores, demographics, pre-pharmacy academic performance factors, and pharmacy school academic performance factors was performed. Bivariate and correlational analyses were conducted along with multiple linear regression modules to determine the influence of variables on the MPJE total scaled score.Results. A total of 136 graduates were included with the majority being female (59%) and non-Hispanic White students (75%). The Pre-MPJE was not significantly correlated with the MPJE first attempt pass/fail outcome or total scaled score. Younger age at graduation, higher pharmacy law course grade, PCOA total and content area 1-4 scaled scores, and final pharmacy GPA were correlated to passing the MPJE. MPJE total scaled score was correlated to higher pre-pharmacy GPA, pharmacy law course grade, PCOA total and content area 1-4 scaled scores, and final pharmacy GPA. However, regression models found the greatest variance in MPJE total scaled score was contributed by the pharmacy law course grade. PCOA total scaled score contributed to some variance for all MPJE takers, but only pharmacy law course grade significantly influenced in-state MPJE total scaled score.Conclusion. The findings did not show pre-MPJE was a predictor for passing or total scaled score for the MPJE. Pharmacy law course performance was the most important determinant of MPJE total scaled score.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective To evaluate a telehealth simulation rubric for a pharmacy skills lab course using inter-rater reliability (IRR) comparing different evaluator types.Methods A rubric was developed and used to score student pharmacists' competency in a telehealth simulation for a pharmacy skills lab course. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine the IRR.Results Fifty-five recorded telehealth simulation sessions were scored three times by a pool of evaluators using the rubric. The overall ICC for the rubric was 0.631 across different types of evaluators, indicating good IRR. Differences in ICC were observed when analyzed by type of evaluator and rubric sub-components.Conclusion The rubric demonstrated good IRR across multiple types of evaluators when used in a skills lab course. Additional evaluation of the rubric and continuous quality improvement is warranted to ensure that assessment becomes more consistent with continued use, regardless of the evaluator type.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
126,34785501,"Overcoming Past Perceptions and Profession-Wide Identity Crisis to Reflect Pharmacy's Future.  The profession of pharmacy has come to encompass a myriad of identities including apothecary, dispenser, merchandiser, expert advisor, and health care provider. While these have changed over time, the responsibilities and scope of practice have not evolved to keep up with the goals of the profession and level of education of practicing pharmacists in the United States. By assuming both the product-centric and patient-centric responsibilities for the aforementioned names, our true professional identity is unclear, which can be linked to the development and preservation of impostor phenomenon among the profession. For pharmacy to truly move forward, we need a unified definition for the profession by either letting go of past identities or separating these identities from each other through altering our standards within professional degree programs and practice models. Without substantial changes to the way we approach this challenge as a profession, the problems described will only persist and deepen.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

128,34785529,"Discrimination experienced by Asian Canadian and Asian American health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study. BACKGROUND Asian Canadians and Asian Americans face COVID-19-related discrimination. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of Asian health care workers dealing with discrimination, with a focus on racial micro-agressions, in Canada and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We adopted a qualitative descriptive approach. We used convenience and snowball sampling strategies to recruit participants. We conducted individual, in-depth semistructured interviews with Asian health care workers in Canada and the US via videoconferencing between May and September 2020. Eligible participants had to self-identify as Asian and be currently employed as a health care worker with at least 1 year of full-time employment. We used an inductive thematic approach to analyze the data. RESULTS Thirty participants were recruited. Fifteen (50%) were Canadians and 15 (50%) were Americans; there were 18 women (60%), 11 men (37%) and 1 nonbinary person. Most of the participants were aged 25-29 years (n = 16, 53%). More than half were nurses (n = 16, 53%); the other participants were attending physicians (n = 5), physiotherapists (n = 3), resident physicians (n = 2), a midwife, a paramedic, a pharmacist and a physician assistant. Two themes emerged from the data: a surge of racial microaggressions related to COVID-19 and a lack of institutional and public acknowledgement. Participants noted that they have experienced an increase in racial microaggressions during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have also experienced threats of violence and actual violence. The largely silent organizational response to the challenges being faced by people of Asian descent and the use of disparaging terms such as ""China virus"" in the early stages of the pandemic were a substantial source of frustration. INTERPRETATION Asian health care workers have experienced challenges in dealing with racial microaggressions related to COVID-19 in the US and Canada. More research should be done on the experiences of Asian Americans and Asian Canadians, both during and after the pandemic, and supportive measures should be put in place to protect Asian health care workers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
129,34787938,"Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in Japanese Elementary Schools: Current conditions and practices. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is the foundation for preventing infectious diseases as the current COVID-19 pandemic shows. WASH in schools is essential for school health, yet there have been very few papers published on WASH in Japanese schools. The objective of this article is to describe the current conditions and practices in Japanese elementary schools using an international framework for WASH in schools and identify implications for handwashing promotion in other areas. METHODS This research is primarily based on a literature review. Information on common practices was also collected through an international workshop with school health experts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION There is a rigorous legal foundation for ensuring the physical infrastructure and quality control of a safe water supply in Japanese schools. Water quality is monitored regularly by Yogo teachers and school pharmacists. Strategic locations and an abundance of water points facilitate handwashing behavior. Hygiene promotion activities by Yogo teachers and student's health committees play a major role in increasing awareness, while health education classes provide minimal but necessary knowledge on handwashing with soap. Flush toilets are the standard, but there is still a demand for toilet improvement. This could be because toilets are expected to evolve in response to changes in the social environment. Children participate in daily cleaning of school toilets; this activity contributes to students understanding the importance of cleanliness. Drawing from the Japanese example, implications and suggestions for WASH in schools' interventions are presented at the end.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
130,34788317,"Magnitude of client satisfaction and its associated factors with outpatient pharmacy service at Dubti General Hospital, Afar, North East Ethiopia: A cross sectional study. INTRODUCTION In Ethiopia the pharmacy service has had several gaps among these were low patient satisfaction, and poor availability of essential pharmaceuticals. In addition, previous studies showed variation in magnitude of client satisfaction, and there is no previous study in the study area. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine client satisfaction with outpatient pharmacy service and associated factors among adult clients at Dubti General Hospital in Afar, Ethiopia. METHODS A hospital based cross sectional study design was employed from February 1 to March 30, 2020 at Dubti General Hospital. Participants were selected by systematic random sampling method. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was computed to assess statistical association between the outcome variable, and independent variables. AOR with 95% CI were used to show statistical Significance at P <0.05. RESULTS The overall satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy service was 165(40.5%). Regarding associated factors, service payment insured through their workplace was positively associated with satisfaction (AOR = 3.178, 95% CI: 1.294-7.80) where as availability of some medications (AOR = 0.393, 95% CI: 0.208-0.741), unfair medication cost (AOR = 0.613, 95% CI: 0.607-0.910), and lack of organized pharmacy work flow (AOR = 0.105, 95% CI: 0.049-0.221) were negatively associated with clients' satisfaction. CONCLUSION The clients' satisfaction in this study is low that warrants immediate corrective measures. Corrective measures should be taken based on identified gaps such as improving drug availability, pharmacy work flow, and cost of medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

132,34788391,"Anion gap physiology and faults of the correction formula. PURPOSE The anion gap is a calculated fundamental laboratory parameter used to identify and monitor acid-base disturbances. A recently popularized correction formula transforms the resulting integer to compensate for hypoalbuminemia and improve diagnostic yield. Clinical pharmacists should be aware of the underlying biochemistry, interpretation, and limitations of this formula to discern drug- and disease-related etiologies. SUMMARY The anion gap is utilized in most care settings, ranging from outpatient monitoring to inpatient intensive care units. Supported by decades of experience, the original anion gap derives its value from its simplicity. Applying the anion gap in metabolic acidosis can help narrow differential diagnosis and detect concomitant acid-base disorders. To account for hypoalbuminemia and potential missed diagnoses, a correction formula was developed to improve sensitivity. Yet, the law of electroneutrality ensures that hypoalbuminemia is already accounted for in the original anion gap, and the proposed correction formula was derived from samples unrepresentative of human physiology. Evidence from clinical trials shows no benefit from applying the correction formula. CONCLUSION There is no advantage to correcting the anion gap, and such correction may increase the risk of misinterpretation or error. Clinicians should understand these limitations when diagnosing or trending acid-base disturbances.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Keeping abreast with current literature can be challenging, especially for practitioners caring for patients sustaining thermal or inhalation injury. Practitioners caring for patients with thermal injuries publish in a wide variety of journals, which further increases the complexity for those with resource limitations. Pharmacotherapy research continues to be a minority focus in primary literature. This review is a renewal of previous years' work to facilitate extraction and review of the most recent pharmacotherapy-centric studies in patients with thermal and inhalation injury. Sixteen geographically dispersed, board-certified pharmacists participated in the review. A MeSH-based, filtered search returned 1,536 manuscripts over the previous 2-year period. After manual review and exclusions, only 98 (6.4%) manuscripts were determined to have a potential impact on current pharmacotherapy practices and included in the review.

135,34789233,"Can a virtual microbiology simulation be as effective as the traditional Wetlab for pharmacy student education? BACKGROUND Pharmacy practice education requires the development of proficiencies and an understanding of clinical microbiology. Learning in this area could be delivered using practical laboratory exercises, or potentially, simulation-based education. Simulation has previously successfully enhanced learning in health professional education. The current global climate due to COVID-19 has further highlighted the important role of technology-enhanced learning in delivering outcomes that meet the requisite learning objectives of a course. The aim of the present study was to compare the impact of a commercially available virtual microbiology simulation (VUMIE™) with a traditional wet laboratory (wetlab) on learner knowledge, skills and confidence in a second-year integrated pharmacotherapeutics course for Bachelor of Pharmacy students. METHODS A randomised, crossover study was employed to determine whether the simulation intervention (VUMIE™) improves learning outcomes (knowledge, skills and confidence) of pharmacy students, when compared to a traditional wetlab intervention. Each student completed three 1-2 h length sessions, for both the wetlab and VUMIE™ interventions (6 sessions total). Data was collected using surveys deployed at baseline (pre-interventions), post-intervention 1 or 2 (VUMIE™ or wetlab) and endpoint (post-interventions 1 and 2). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics 25 and Instat™ software. RESULTS Response rates were approximately 50% at initial survey and approximately 25% at endpoint survey. VUMIE™ produced higher post-intervention knowledge scores for the multiple-choice questions compared to the wetlab, however, the highest score was achieved at endpoint. Both interventions produced statistically significant differences for mean scores compared to baseline (pre-VUMIE™ and wetlab) across the domains of knowledge, skills and confidence. VUMIE™ produced higher post-intervention mean scores for knowledge, skills and confidence compared to post-intervention mean scores for the wetlab, however there was no statistical significance between the mean score for the two interventions, thus the VUMIE™ activity produced learning outcomes comparable to the wetlab activity. CONCLUSION These findings suggest VUMIE™ provides similar effects on students' knowledge, skills, and confidence as a wetlab. The simulation's implementation was not cost-prohibitive, provided students with a physically and psychologically safe learning environment, and the benefit of being able to repeat activities, supporting deliberate practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
136,34789270,"Assessing the relationship between syringe exchange, pharmacy, and street sources of accessing syringes and injection drug use behavior in a pooled nationally representative sample of people who inject drugs in the United States from 2002 to 2019.  Provision of sterile syringes is an evidence-based strategy of reducing syringe sharing and reusing and yet, access to sterile syringes through pharmacies and syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in the United States remains inadequate. This nationally representative study examined associations between obtaining syringes from pharmacies, SEPs, and sterilizing syringes with bleach and risk of syringe borrowing, lending and reusing syringes in a pooled cross-sectional dataset of 1737 PWID from the 2002-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression was used to produce odds ratios (OR) of the odds of injection drug behaviors after adjusting for obtaining syringes from SEPs, pharmacies, the street, and other sources and potential confounders of race, ethnicity, sex, education, and insurance coverage. Obtaining syringes through SEPs was associated with lower odds of borrowing (OR = .4, CI95% = .2, .9, p = .022) and reusing syringes (OR = .3, CI95% = .2, .6, < .001) compared to obtaining syringes on the street. Obtaining syringes from pharmacies was associated with lower odds of borrowing (OR = .5, CI95% = .3, .9, p = .037) and lending (OR = .5 CI95% = .3, .9, p = .020) syringes.

137,34789404,"The impact of faculty and student pharmacist relationships on burnout. BACKGROUND Students in health professions, including student pharmacist, are at an increased risk of psychological distress. Unfortunately, effective efforts to combat burnout for student pharmacists are still lacking in the literature and create a void in schools and colleges of pharmacy that seek to assist their students. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to explore how increasing positive out-of-class interactions between the student pharmacists and faculty members affect burnout, especially in work exhaustion and interpersonal disengagement. Professional fulfillment was also assessed as a primary outcome. METHODS The institutional review board approved this study consisting of 4 faculty members and 12 students. After providing informed consent, the participants were assigned to one of 4 groups. Each group included 1 faculty member and 3 students. At the start of the study, each participant completed a modified Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index questionnaire to measure baseline burnout characteristics and initial level of professional fulfillment. For 8 weeks, the groups met weekly to discuss a topic related to burnout and professional fulfillment. After 8 weeks, each participant completed the postquestionnaire. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to the mean scores (pre vs. post) in each of the 3 constructs. The statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS The results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the burnout constructs, work exhaustion and interpersonal disengagement. There was not a statistically significant change in professional fulfillment. CONCLUSIONS Improving relationships between student pharmacist and faculty through increasing out-of-class interactions benefits individuals who are at risk of experiencing burnout.

OBJECTIVES As part of the service provided by clinical pharmacists in our hospital, an assay for plasma amikacin quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been established for clinical use since 2018. This study was undertaken to describe: (1) the establishment of this assay; (2) the application and results of the testing; and (3) the analysis and impact for patients. METHODS The amikacin quantification assay was validated and the plasma amikacin concentration data were extracted and analysed. The clinical data for related patients were collected from electronic health and medical records. RESULTS 121 plasma samples from 53 patients were included in this statistical analysis. The use of amikacin was mostly monitored in the intensive care unit and the haematology department, and the monitoring range of amikacin concentrations were about 0.1-57µg/mL. The main indications for amikacin concentration detection were combined medications, impaired renal function, or people over 65 years old, which may increase the incidence of adverse reactions. Amikacin prescribing decisions were diversified due to the combination of assay results and clinical disease progression, and the effective rate of amikacin administration was about 52.8% (28/53). CONCLUSIONS The assay for plasma amikacin concentration has been successfully established to monitor the clinical use of amikacin, and the assay results served as one of the references for amikacin prescribing decisions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of low-fidelity simulation on students' confidence, knowledge, and skills in pediatric physical assessments, and to compare students' interest ratings of topics and effectiveness of learning activities between students' who experienced simulation and those who did not. METHODS Within a pediatric elective, a vital signs and physical assessment activity was re-designed to incorporate a low-fidelity heart and breath sounds simulator. Students rated their confidence in completing 9 different physical assessment skills before and after the activity and assessment. Students' perspectives of the activity were also assessed. Course evaluation surveys were compared with prior course offerings (without simulation) to determine a change in students' interest ratings of the topic and effectiveness of learning activities. The Wilcoxon signed rank test, thematic analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze outcomes. RESULTS All 106 second professional year students in the elective completed the pre- and post-simulation surveys and course evaluations for 3 offerings. Students' post-simulation average confidence scores increased statistically on all 9 skills compared with pre-simulation scores. All students agreed or strongly agreed ""the lecture and simulation activity done in class helped me overcome challenges I had with learning the skill."" Students (98%) successfully demonstrated competency on the formal assessment. Compared with previous course offerings, students reported higher interest ratings in the topics and instruction effectiveness when simulation was incorporated into the activity.

OBJECTIVE Initial posaconazole dosing regimens in children often do not achieve target concentrations, and data continue to support the need for higher initial dosing regimens. The objective of this study is to contribute to the current data regarding suboptimal posaconazole dosing in pediatric patients by retrospectively observing dosing strategies and subsequent drug concentrations. METHODS This study was conducted at a single institution in 27 patients aged 1 to 21 years. Patients who were initiated on any formulation of posaconazole for prophylaxis or treatment while admitted to the hospital were included. The primary outcome was to determine the percentage of pediatric patients who achieved the targeted trough concentration using their initial posaconazole dosing regimen. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients who experienced a breakthrough invasive fungal infection (IFI), percentage of patients with elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and discontinuation for any reason. RESULTS There were 15 patients (55.5%) who reached desired trough serum concentration after the initial dosing regimen. The number of dose modifications to achieve the desired trough ranged from 1 to 3. Most patients received delayed-release tablets (n = 17), and the average doses for reaching prophylactic and treatment trough concentrations were 6.1 mg/kg/day and 11 mg/kg/day, respectively. There were 2 patients (7.4%) who experienced breakthrough IFI. Overall, 5 patients developed elevated LFTs and 7 patients discontinued treatment early.

Despite the growing use of chemotherapy drugs in resource-constrained settings, training opportunities on safe handling practices are lacking. This study's objectives were to develop and evaluate an e-learning training module on the safe handling of chemotherapy drugs to strengthen knowledge and practices in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The module's curriculum was developed using the Six-Step Approach for Curriculum Development for Medical Education. Asynchronous, self-paced, e-learning lessons within the module were created and uploaded onto a free online platform, Pharm-Ed. The study ran online from January to April 2021. Participant recruitment was done using convenience sampling through various channels (social media, communities of practice). Training module effectiveness was evaluated using knowledge assessments (a pre-test and post-test study design) and participant satisfaction. We developed a comprehensive e-learning module on the safe handling of chemotherapy drugs comprising 11 asynchronous, self-paced, e-learning lessons. Eighty-two participants (68% pharmacists and 17% pharmacy students) from 17 countries completed at least one lesson, with a total of 259 lessons completed. Evaluation of the different lessons showed significant improvements in theoretical knowledge (p < 0.01) in all except one lesson and a high degree of participant satisfaction.

RESULTS Of 3,024 pharmacists contacted, 614 pharmacists (20.3%) responded to an online survey and 550 (18.2% of overall sample) completed the MBI and were included for analysis. Overall, high levels of burnout were observed in 61.8% of respondents based on the MBI, with 57.9% of respondents scoring high on the emotional exhaustion domain and 31.3% high in the depersonalization domain. Pharmacists with burnout worked on average 48.6 (±9.6) hours per week compared with 44.5 (±9.6) hours per week for those without high burnout and spent more time on administrative tasks per week (7.5 hours v 4.3 hours; all P < .001). Pharmacists reporting high burnout were more likely to report concern they had made a major medication error within the past 3 months (27.6% v 8.1%; P < .001) and greater intent to leave their current job within 2 years (60.3% v 19.0%; P < .001). CONCLUSION Burnout is prevalent among hematology-oncology pharmacists and may affect both patient safety and the adequacy of the workforce. Risk factors for burnout among hematology-oncology pharmacists in this study may be targets for burnout mitigation and prevention strategies to reduce the impact on pharmacists and improve cancer care for patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
149,34794171,"Performance of a trigger tool for detecting drug-related hospital admissions in older people: analysis from the OPERAM trial. BACKGROUND identifying drug-related hospital admissions (DRAs) in older people is difficult. A standardised chart review procedure has recently been developed. It includes an adjudication team (physician and pharmacist) screening using 26 triggers and then performing causality assessment to determine whether an adverse drug event (ADE) occurred (secondary to an adverse drug reaction, overuse, misuse or underuse) and whether the ADE contributed to hospital admission (DRA). OBJECTIVE to assess the performance of those triggers in detecting DRA. DESIGN retrospective study using data from the OPERAM (OPtimising thERapy to prevent Avoidable hospital admissions in Multimorbid older people) trial. SETTINGS four European medical centres. SUBJECTS multimorbid (≥ 3 chronic medical conditions) older (≥ 70 years) inpatients with polypharmacy (≥ 5 chronic medications) were enrolled in the OPERAM trial (N = 2,008) and followed for 12 months. We included patients with ≥1 adjudicated hospitalisation during the follow-up. METHODS the positive predictive value (PPV; number of DRAs identified by trigger/number of triggers) was calculated for each trigger and for the tool as a whole. RESULTS of 1,235 hospitalisations adjudicated for 832 patients, 716 (58%) had at least one trigger; an ADE was identified in 673 (54%) and 518 (42%) were adjudicated as DRAs. The overall PPV of the trigger tool for detecting DRAs was 0.66 [0.62-0.69]. CONCLUSIONS this tool performs well for identifying DRAs in older people. Based on our results, a revised version of the tool was proposed but will require external validation before it can be incorporated into research and clinical practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
150,34794833,"Development of a Probiotics Practice E-Reference Database for Health Care Professionals. PURPOSE Currently available references provide evidence on the efficacy of probiotics strains but exclude product-specific information, making it challenging for health care professionals (HCPs) to provide consumers with suitable recommendations on probiotics. An online probiotics e-reference database was developed to assist HCPs in delivering evidence-based recommendations on probiotics to consumers. The usability and applicability of the database in health care practice were evaluated. METHODS Information on the efficacy of probiotics and probiotic products was collated using a PubMed literature search, and from local pharmacies and online supplement stores. A web database was compiled using various programming scripts and uploaded onto a web server. The database was beta-tested using an online self-administered questionnaire for community-based pharmacists, and responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. FINDINGS The database comprised 584 clinical study excerpts, 449 probiotic products, and 1879 unique product-study links. Users can search for suitable probiotics based on their indication profile or for a specific probiotic product. Information provided includes the probiotic constituents, dosage regimen, and indications of the product, with supporting clinical evidence. Overall, all participants of the beta-test indicated that they were satisfied with the database and were willing to use it again (both, 13 participants [100%]). In addition, all participants indicated that they found the database intuitive to use and smooth functioning, without inconsistencies (both, 13 [100%]). The majority also indicated that they found the information provided to be clear, comprehensive, and useful in health care practice (12 [92.3%] each). IMPLICATIONS The probiotics e-reference database is an integrated resource that is user-friendly, and provides HCPs with ready access to clear and comprehensive information on probiotic products and clinical studies, so that HCPs can provide consumers with relevant and evidence-based recommendations on probiotics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The reactivation of the hepatitis B virus(HBV)induced by chemotherapy can cause fulminant hepatitis, followed by death. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare released the guideline on the prevention of chemotherapy- induced reactivation of HBV in 2009. The NCGM's pharmacy department conducted a study on the HBV screening rate and the guideline compliance rate in patients undergoing chemotherapy who met the criteria for monthly HBV DNA monitoring during chemotherapy and 12 months after. We also conducted a study on the influence on the guideline compliance rate with inquiries by pharmacists. The HBV screening rate was 100%(68/68 cases), and there were inquiries in 10.3% (7/68 cases). This suggests that inquiries contributed to the improvement in the HBV screening rate. However, the guideline compliance rate in high-risk cases was 75.0%(12/16 cases). It is necessary to raise awareness in physicians and patients on the management of HBV reactivation and to establish a follow-up system for HBV DNA monitoring.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
152,34795543,"Community Pharmacists' Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Pediatric Pain Management in Nigeria. Purpose Community pharmacists (CPs) frequently attend to pediatric patients with pain but limited data exist regarding their knowledge of and attitude to effective management of pediatric pain in Nigeria. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge of and attitude to pediatric pain management among CPs in Nigeria. Patients and Methods A validated and pilot-tested questionnaire, the Community Pharmacists Survey on Pediatric Pain, was administered to 517 eligible participants at the 38th Annual National Conference of the Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria. Independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used for inferential statistical analyses. Results CPs with additional higher academic qualifications and clinically related additional academic degrees had significantly higher mean knowledge scores relative to first degree only holder counterpart (t= 4.33, p< 0.05, Eta2=0.05) and those without clinically related second degrees (t= 6.34, p< 0.05, Eta2=0.27). Pain knowledge among the study cohort also varied significantly by age group, years of practicing community pharmacy, ownership structure of premises, geographical location of practice and previous exposure to pain management training (F(4370)=2.858, p=0.025, Eta2=0.03; F(3371)=3.985, p=0.008, Eta2=0.03; F(2372)=3.643, p=0.027, Eta2=0.02; F(5369)=4.497, p=0.01, Eta2=0.06; F(2372)=3.587, p=0.029, Eta2=0.02), respectively.

153,34795591,"Real-World Data of Tigecycline-Associated Drug-Induced Liver Injury Among Patients in China: A 3-year Retrospective Study as Assessed by the Updated RUCAM.  Background: Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic, is increasingly used clinically for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, but it is also associated with hepatotoxicity. However, the incidence and risk factors of tigecycline-associated drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the incidence, characteristics and risk factors of tigecycline-associated DILI in the real-world clinic setting. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted in inpatients who received tigecycline treatment from January 2018 to January 2020. Based on the biochemical criteria of DILI and the causality assessment by Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) using cases with a probable or highly probable causality grading, two clinical pharmacists and one clinician worked together to screen patients for tigecycline-associated DILI. Then patients with DILI were randomly matched by gender in a ratio of 1:2 to the remaining patients in the tigecycline cohort without biochemical abnormalities to identify risk factors. Results: A total of 973 patients from 1,250 initial participants were included. The incidence of tigecycline-associated DILI was 5.7% (55/973). Among 55 DILI patients, 10 cases presented with the hepatocellular pattern, 4 cases belonged to the mixed pattern, and 41 presented with the cholestatic pattern. Most cases reached the severity of grade 1 and 2. The rate of recovery in hepatocellular pattern, mixed pattern, and cholestatic pattern was 70.0, 50.0, and 41.5%, respectively. The proportion of the DILI cases treated with high dose (100 mg) and prolonged duration (>14 days) was significantly higher than standard dose and routine duration (100.0% vs. 18.1%, p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that high maintenance dose (OR = 1.028, p = 0.002), prolonged duration (OR = 1.208, p = 0.000), and number of hepatotoxic drugs (OR = 2.232, p = 0.000) were independent factors of tigecycline-associated DILI. Conclusion: Tigecycline was associated with liver injury, with a slightly higher incidence (5.7%) than the frequency of ""frequent"" (5%) defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Patients with a high maintenance dose and prolonged tigecycline regimen, as well as concomitant use of multiple hepatotoxic drugs should be paid more attention.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
154,34795710,"Community pharmacists' management of self-limiting infections: a simulation study in Akwa Ibom State, South-South Nigeria. Background Inappropriate use of antibiotics, especially for treatment of self-limiting infections remains one of the major drivers of antibiotic resistance (ABR). Community pharmacists can contribute to reducing ABR by ensuring antibiotics are dispensed only when necessary. Objective To assess community pharmacists' management of self-limiting infections. Methods A purposive sample of 75 pharmacies participated in the study. Each pharmacy was visited by an investigator and a trained simulated patient who mimicked symptoms of common cold and acute diarrhoea, respectively. Interactions between the simulated patient and pharmacist were recorded by the investigator in a data collection form after each visit. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. Ethics approval was obtained from the state Ministry of Health Research Ethics Committee. Results For common cold, 68% (51/75) of pharmacists recommended an antibiotic. Azithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (43%, 24%, 20%, respectively) were the most frequently dispensed agents. For acute diarrhoea, 72% (54/75) of pharmacists dispensed one antibiotic, while 15% dispensed more than one antibiotic. The most frequently dispensed agent was metronidazole (82%), which was dispensed in addition to amoxicillin or tetracycline among pharmacists who dispensed more than one agent. In both infection scenarios, advice on dispensed antibiotics was ofered in 73% and 87% of the interactions, respectively. Conclusion This study shows high rate of inappropriate antibiotics dispensing among community pharmacists. There is need for improved awareness of antibiotic resistance through continuing education and training of community pharmacists. Furthermore, the inclusion of antibiotic resistance and stewardship in undergraduate pharmacy curriculum is needed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Medications known to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF) are either not prescribed or prescribed at sub-therapeutic doses. The addition of clinical pharmacists to the HF team positively impacts optimizing prognostic medications for a patient with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Objective To assess the intervention of the clinical pharmacist as part of the multidisciplinary (MD) team in up-titration to achieve target doses of key therapeutic agents for HFrEF. Methods This was a prospective one group pretest-posttest interventional study; a comparison of the target dose achievement of key therapeutic agents for HFrEF was performed before and after clinical pharmacist interventions. Results Out of 110 HFrEF patients, 57.3% were males, and the mean age of patients was 55.8 years (SD 12.6). Cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of HF. At baseline, 86% were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ACEIs/ARBs/ARNi) and 93.6% on beta blockers (BBs). At the end of study, the proportion of patients achieved the target dose was significantly increased (0 vs 77.4%, 6.8 vs 85.4%, and 0 vs 55.6%) for ACEIs, ARBs and ARNi, respectively, and (8.6% vs 66.1%; P = 0.001) for BBs. Moreover, the up-titration process was associated with significant improvement in most clinical as ejection fraction and New York Heart Association (NYHA) scale and laboratory characteristics.

156,34797865,"'They eat it like sweets': A mixed methods study of antibiotic perceptions and their use among patients, prescribers and pharmacists in a district hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. BACKGROUND Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat. In Afghanistan, high levels of indiscriminate antibiotic use exist, and healthcare programmes are not informed by understanding of local attitudes towards rational antibiotic use. Médecins Sans Frontières is an international non-governmental organization providing healthcare services to the Ahmad Shah Baba (ASB) District Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, since 2009. This mixed-methods study aimed to explore the perceptions and attitudes toward antibiotics among patients, prescribers, and pharmacists in the ASB District hospital outpatient department. METHODS AND FINDINGS Knowledge of antibiotics including their purpose and function, how and why they are used, and drivers for choice of antibiotic was examined at patient, prescriber, and provider-level. The first phase of the study, an exploratory qualitative component using an interpretative approach, was used to inform the second phase, a structured survey. Thirty-six interviews were conducted with 39 participants (21 patients or caretakers and 18 hospital health workers). Three hundred and fifty-one (351) patients and caretakers completed the second phase, the structured survey. This study found that poor knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance is a driving factor for inappropriate use of antibiotics. Participant perceptions of living in a polluted environment drove the high demand and perceived 'need' for antibiotics: patients, doctors and pharmacists alike consider dirty and dusty living conditions as causes of 'disease' in the body, requiring antibiotics to 'clean' and 'strengthen' it. CONCLUSIONS Findings highlight the need for strategies to improve awareness and knowledge of the general public, improve practice of doctors and pharmacists, regulate antibiotic dispensing in private pharmacies, and implement antibiotic stewardship in hospitals.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
157,34797894,"Detection of overdose and underdose prescriptions-An unsupervised machine learning approach.  Overdose prescription errors sometimes cause serious life-threatening adverse drug events, while underdose errors lead to diminished therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is important to detect and prevent these errors. In the present study, we used the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), one of the most common unsupervised machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection, to identify overdose and underdose prescriptions. We extracted prescription data from electronic health records in Kyushu University Hospital between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. We constructed an OCSVM model for each of the 21 candidate drugs using three features: age, weight, and dose. Clinical overdose and underdose prescriptions, which were identified and rectified by pharmacists before administration, were collected. Synthetic overdose and underdose prescriptions were created using the maximum and minimum doses, defined by drug labels or the UpToDate database. We applied these prescription data to the OCSVM model and evaluated its detection performance. We also performed comparative analysis with other unsupervised outlier detection algorithms (local outlier factor, isolation forest, and robust covariance). Twenty-seven out of 31 clinical overdose and underdose prescriptions (87.1%) were detected as abnormal by the model. The constructed OCSVM models showed high performance for detecting synthetic overdose prescriptions (precision 0.986, recall 0.964, and F-measure 0.973) and synthetic underdose prescriptions (precision 0.980, recall 0.794, and F-measure 0.839). In comparative analysis, OCSVM showed the best performance. Our models detected the majority of clinical overdose and underdose prescriptions and demonstrated high performance in synthetic data analysis. OCSVM models, constructed using features such as age, weight, and dose, are useful for detecting overdose and underdose prescriptions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
158,34798631,"Barriers and facilitators in the clinical implementation of beta-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill patients: a critical review. PURPOSE With increasing knowledge of beta-lactam pharmacodynamics and inter- and intra-patient variability in pharmacokinetics, the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is becoming increasingly clear. However, little research has been conducted to identify potential barriers and facilitators in the clinical implementation of beta-lactam TDM. This paper provides an overview of the current practices of beta-lactam TDM and barriers and facilitators in its implementation. METHODS A systematic search was conducted using the Ovid MEDLINE database in April 2021, without restrictions on the publication date. All studies reporting the implementation of beta-lactam antibiotic TDM in critically ill patients through questionnaires or surveys were included in this review. RESULTS Six eligible studies were identified from 215 records, all of which were cross-sectional. All studies identified barriers and facilitators in the implementation of beta-lactam TDM in critically ill patients. The main barriers were insufficient knowledge about various aspects regarding the implementation of beta-lactam TDM and the unavailability of assays. Furthermore, a delay in the acquisition of TDM results reduces the probability of physicians altering drug dosages. Lastly, doubts about the cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam TDM in critically ill patients hinders broad implementation. Moreover, to improve the willingness of physicians to use beta-lactam TDM, collaboration between physicians and clinical pharmacists and clinical microbiologists should be strengthened. CONCLUSION While the evidence for application of beta-lactam TDM continues to grow, its clinical implementation remains limited. To enable optimal implementation of these antibiotics in critically ill patients, several barriers need to be overcome in terms of logistics, equipment availability, clinical evidence, and proof of cost-effectiveness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
159,34798826,"Effects of an interprofessional deprescribing intervention in Swiss nursing homes: the Individual Deprescribing Intervention (IDeI) randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND Deprescribing polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) has been shown to be beneficial to nursing home (NH) residents' health. Medication reviews are the most widely studied deprescribing intervention; in a previous trial, we showed that another intervention, a deprescribing-focused interprofessional quality circle, can reduce the use of inappropriate medications at the NH level. However, this intervention cannot account for the variety of the residents' clinical situations. Therefore, we trialled a subsequent intervention in NH that enacted the quality circle intervention in the previous year. METHODS In 7 NHs, the most heavily medicated residents were recruited and randomised to receive usual care or the intervention. The intervention was a pharmacist-led, deprescribing-focused medication review, followed by the creation of an individualised treatment modification plan in collaboration with nurses and physicians. Intervention's effects were assessed after four months on the number and dose of PIMs used, quality of life, and safety outcomes (mortality, hospitalisations, falls, and use of physical restraints). Data were analysed using Poisson multivariate regression models. RESULTS Sixty-two NH residents participated, falling short of the expected 100 participants; 4 died before initial data collection. Participants used a very high number of drugs (median 15, inter-quartile range [12-19]) and PIMs (median 5, IQR [3-7]) at baseline. The intervention did not reduce the number of PIMs prescribed to the participants; however, it significantly decreased their dose (incidence rate ratio 0.763, CI95 [0.594; 0.979]), in particular for chronic drugs (IRR 0.716, CI95 [0.546; 0.938]). No adverse effects were seen on mortality, hospitalisations, falls, and restraints use, but, in the intervention group, three participants experienced adverse events that required the reintroduction of withdrawn treatments, and a decrease in quality of life is possible. CONCLUSIONS As it did not reach its recruitment target, this trial should be seen as exploratory. Results indicate that, following a NH-level deprescribing intervention, a resident-level intervention can further reduce some aspects of PIMs use. Great attention must be paid to residents' well-being when further developing such deprescribing interventions, as a possible reduction in quality of life was found in the intervention group, and some participants suffered adverse events following deprescribing.

161,34798895,"A cost utility analysis alongside a cluster-randomised trial evaluating a minor ailment service compared to usual care in community pharmacy. BACKGROUND Minor ailments are ""self-limiting conditions which may be diagnosed and managed without a medical intervention"". A cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) was designed to evaluate the clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes of a Minor Ailment Service (MAS) in community pharmacy (CP) compared with usual care (UC). METHODS The cRCT was conducted for 6 months from December 2017. The pharmacist-patient intervention consisted of a standardised face-to-face consultation on a web-based program using co-developed protocols, pharmacists' training, practice change facilitators and patients' educational material. Patients requesting a non-prescription medication (direct product request) or presenting minor ailments received MAS or UC and were followed-up by telephone 10-days after the consultation. The primary economic outcomes were incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the service and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Total costs included health system, CPs and patient direct costs: health professionals' consultation time, medication costs, pharmacists' training costs, investment of the pharmacy and consultation costs within the 10 days following the initial consultation. The HRQoL was obtained using the EuroQoL 5D-5L at the time of the consultation and at 10-days follow up. A sensitivity analysis was carried out using bootstrapping. There were two sub-group analyses undertaken, for symptom presentation and direct product requests, to evaluate possible differences. RESULTS A total of 808 patients (323 MAS and 485 UC) were recruited in 27 CPs with 42 pharmacists (20 MAS and 22 UC). 64.7% (n = 523) of patients responded to follow-up after their consultation in CP. MAS patients gained an additional 0.0003 QALYs (p = 0.053). When considering only MAS patients presenting with symptoms, the ICUR was 24,733€/QALY with a 47.4% probability of cost-effectiveness (willingness to pay of 25,000€/QALY). Although when considering patients presenting for a direct product request, MAS was the dominant strategy with a 93.69% probability of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Expanding community pharmacists' scope through MAS may benefit health systems. To be fully cost effective, MAS should not only include consultations arising from symptom presentation but also include an oversight of self-selected products by patients. MAS increase patient safety through the appropriate use of non-prescription medication and through the direct referral of patients to GP. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN, ISRCTN17235323 .

INTRODUCTION An integrated, competency-based curriculum that fosters social accountability including cultural sensitivity among graduates is an educational strategy towards producing practice-ready professionals. This study aimed to evaluate pharmacy graduates' perceptions of competency, integration, and social accountability in the undergraduate curriculum of Nigerian schools of pharmacy. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey consisting of a 42-item questionnaire was administered to 467 purposively selected pharmacy graduates who completed their undergraduate training between January 2012 and February 2020 from 20 accredited Nigerian pharmacy schools. Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the differences in the participants' responses on a Likert scale. RESULTS Of 467 participants, 54.4% felt that the Nigerian undergraduate pharmacy curriculum was not adequate in content, while 54.2% felt the courses in the curriculum were not well integrated to facilitate easy learning by students. About half (50.6%) strongly agreed or agreed that ""the basic pharmacy courses are well synchronized with the clinical components"" but 28.9% strongly disagreed or disagreed. The majority (88%), with no significant difference between gender (z = -1.615, P = .11), strongly agreed or agreed that they apply knowledge of clients' culture and disparity to deliver pharmaceutical services. CONCLUSIONS Marginally above half of the graduates perceived the Nigerian undergraduate pharmacy curriculum to be deficient in course content.

INTRODUCTION With community pharmacy transitioning from a fee-for-service model to a value-based care focus, the desired skills of pharmacist graduates is an evolving paradigm. As active stakeholders in community practice, pharmacist preceptors are in a unique position to compare the ever-changing dichotomy between pharmacy practice and training. Examining preceptors' assessments of these essential contemporary practice skills may provide useful insights. METHODS A survey was emailed to all regional, active college of pharmacy community advanced pharmacy practice experiences preceptors. Participating preceptors were given 30 days to complete the online survey. Weekly reminders were provided. RESULTS Of the 168 preceptors invited to participate, 42 (25%) completed the survey. Descriptive analysis compared preceptors' perceptions of transformative services vs. their relative implementation in practice. This revealed service areas such as health screenings that were proportionate in their prevalence of offering and perception as contemporary. In contrast, services such as pharmacogenomic testing were more widely perceived as contemporary compared to their low prevalence as an offering. Participants showed broad consensus in the importance of most skills listed in the survey, predominantly indicating these skills were either ""very important"" or ""extremely important."" Only a few specific skills areas were identified that showed less consensus, with a minority of respondents specifying that these skills were of less importance. CONCLUSIONS Preceptor surveys may offer insights on the progression of community practice curricula. Continued monitoring of changes in service parameters over time may reveal trends in practice transformation, identifying service areas being more widely adopted.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this research brief was to describe interventions related to spirituality and/or religion that are encountered by students during advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) patient care activities. METHODS Fourth-year pharmacy students were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire defining the frequency and setting of patient care activities that incorporated spiritual beliefs during APPEs. Data analysis utilized descriptive statistics. RESULTS Sixty-three students completed the questionnaire. The most common theme encountered was that of patient refusal of specific therapy based on patient's spiritual or religious beliefs. This result remained consistent across multiple practice settings, except in the community practice setting, where product substitution due to a religious forbidden ingredient was the most common theme encountered.

166,34799058,"Does the ability to identify the construct on an empathy situational judgment test relate to performance? Exploring a new concept in assessment. INTRODUCTION The ability to identify criteria (ATIC) refers to an examinee's capacity to distinguish the construct being evaluated. Previous research indicates ATIC can be predictive of performance on some assessments. This exploratory study investigated the relationship between a participant's ability to identify criteria and their performance on an empathy situational judgment test (SJT), an assessment format used to measure social and behavioral attributes. METHODS A 12-item empathy SJT was completed by 15 students and 15 pharmacists. During a cognitive interview, participants were asked what they believed each exam question measured. Responses were coded to determine whether participants stated ""empathy"" (indication of ATIC). The point-biserial correlation coefficient was calculated to explore the relationship of ATIC (correctly or not correctly identifying the item measured empathy) and performance on the SJT (total score). RESULTS Participants identified empathy 33.3% of the time, and it was the construct most often identified. Pharmacists (27.5%) identified empathy less often than students (39.2%). When empathy was identified as the construct, it was most often reported for items in a non-healthcare setting (56.3%) rather than a healthcare setting (43.7%) and for questions targeting affective empathy (71.3%) rather than cognitive empathy (28.7%). There were no statistically significant relationships with correctly identifying the construct and performance on individual items and the overall test. CONCLUSIONS There is inconclusive evidence that ATIC relates to performance on an empathy SJT. Additional research is needed to evaluate the role of ATIC and assessment performance to corroborate study results.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
167,34799059,"Evaluating the impact of a ""grand rounds"" elective course on students' perceived motivations, comfort, and confidence in providing constructive and reinforcing feedback to guest lecturers. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Providing feedback is an important skill for all healthcare professionals both within and outside of their discipline. Although student pharmacists frequently receive feedback during both didactic and experiential education, training on how to provide feedback to others is less common. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING An elective was designed to expose second-year pharmacy students to ""grand rounds"" with practicing pharmacists as the presenters. Students provided feedback to presenters on presentation style and assessment questions. The primary objective of this research project was to determine if the elective improved students' motivations, comfort, and confidence in providing constructive written feedback. FINDINGS Over two course offerings, 54% (19 of 35) of enrolled students completed both the pre- and post-surveys. At baseline, the majority of students self-identified as being motivated, comfortable, and confident with providing quality written feedback with the exception of two specific areas: motivation to provide quality written feedback and comfort with providing difficult or sensitive written feedback. At the end of the course, the majority of students self-identified as being motivated, comfortable, and confident across all areas queried. All students agreed or strongly agreed that the efficiency and quality of their written feedback improved during the course. SUMMARY The course offered several benefits to students, including learning clinical topics from a variety of presenters and developing feedback skills. The implementation of the grand rounds elective provided students an opportunity to develop their motivation, comfort, and confidence with providing quality constructive written feedback.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
168,34799060,"Impact of a pilot elective course to address student pharmacist well-being. INTRODUCTION Survey results from 2016 and 2018 at the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy highlighted mental health concerns for the student population, including struggles with depression, anxiety, and academic distress. This led to creation of a pilot well-being elective course for first year doctor of pharmacy students. This article describes how this course was assessed and adapted for the future. METHODS The well-being elective course used a course-specific survey and the Brief Inventory of Thriving to assess student outcomes. The course-specific survey was based upon the course objectives and the University of Michigan Common Agenda for Well-Being. Both surveys were given pre- and post-course to identify change. RESULTS Course survey results illustrated an improvement in student well-being over a single semester. Compared with pre-course responses, students who completed the course were significantly more likely to agree with statements indicating they had strong time management skills, resilience to manage the fluctuations of life, were able to make thoughtful choices to reduce harm and promote well-being, and overall rated their well-being as excellent. Additionally, nearly all students felt a sense of strengthened community with peers and faculty within the course, better able to recognize or refer a peer for help, and felt the course contributed to their overall well-being. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of this well-being elective pilot course provided students the tools and resources to improve upon their overall well-being in an effort to address anxiety, depression, and academic distress.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
169,34799061,"Design and implementation of a pilot student wellness program at a school of pharmacy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In response to concerns about student stress and well-being, a volunteer wellness task force was formed to promote a culture of wellness at the school of pharmacy (SOP). The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of this pilot wellness program. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING A task force was formed to design and implement a pilot wellness program for pharmacy students. Interventions included: orientation to wellness program, sessions on nutrition and mindfulness, in-class brain breaks, and promotion of on-campus resources. Student wellness was assessed at baseline with a questionnaire including sociodemographic data, perceived stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), wellness practices, and use of wellness resources. Program feedback was obtained using a post-questionnaire to identify student perceptions and preferences for wellness activities. FINDINGS Pharmacy year one through three students (n = 166) were included in the pilot wellness program, with 92.2% and 88.8% completing the baseline and post-questionnaires, respectively. There were notable changes in wellness practices compared to baseline including an increase in weekly exercise and sleeping >4 hours a night. There was greatest use of and satisfaction with 5- to 10-min in-class wellness breaks. The mean student PSS-10 baseline score was 20.14 while the post-implementation mean score was 19.62.

The design, implementation, and lessons learned from this pilot program may serve as a practical framework for institutions seeking to promote student wellness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
170,34799062,"Utilization of an emotional intelligence workshop to enhance student pharmacists' self-awareness. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This study evaluated the impact of an emotional intelligence (EI) workshop as a tool to improve student pharmacists' self-awareness. The primary objectives were to assess the change in student pharmacists' self-awareness as measured by the Self-Awareness Outcomes Questionnaire (SAOQ) and identify trends in their self-reflection. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING A four-hour EI workshop was delivered in a first-year required student pharmacist leadership course. The components of the workshop included: an EI assessment via the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i 2.0) administered to student pharmacists outside of class, active learning class time that applied the principles of EI to leadership and group dynamics, and peer-to-peer discussions. Personal results of the EQ-i 2.0 were reviewed individually and in small groups. Student pharmacists completed a self-reflection and EI action plan outside of class. The SAOQ was completed before and after the workshop and the aggregated Likert scales were analyzed by paired t-tests. FINDINGS After two consecutive course offerings of the workshop (N = 100), there was a significant increase in the total SAOQ score as well as a significant increase for the three positive subscales: reflective self-development, acceptance, and proactivity. There was no change in the negative subscale: emotional costs. Student pharmacists positively perceived the workshop and reported that the activities motivated students to improve their interpersonal skills and increase extracurricular involvement.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In-person Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are used as assessments in most pharmacy programs, however, reports of virtual OSCEs and skills assessments are limited. With a pivot to virtual OSCEs necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider core competencies assessed as well as logistics, technology, and other factors. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING The virtual redesign of a Capstone OSCE for third professional year pharmacy students at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS Core components of pivoting an in-person Capstone OSCE to virtual included an initial assessment of what was planned, what competencies were being assessed, and how this could be accomplished in the virtual realm. Key stakeholders such as students, testing and evaluation services, and faculty were included in the planning process. In addition to changes in OSCE delivery, grading processes and remediation were also modified. SUMMARY This Capstone OSCE merged virtual education and skills-based assessments together out of necessity and provides an example of flexibility and nimbleness in times of great change. Although further assessment is needed, processes used and lessons learned are helpful for future, intentional planning of virtual or partially virtual skills assessments.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
173,34799066,"Measuring the immediate impact when first year pharmacy students are introduced to diverse career pathways. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To assess if exposure to diverse pharmacy career pathways influences the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) student's career plans within the first month of an academic curriculum. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING First year PharmD students were enrolled in a four-week course with a focus on introduction to core practice areas of pharmacy: community, hospital, and managed care. Guidance was provided with resources and a pharmacist panel to aid in both self-learning and direct sharing about diverse areas of pharmacy practice extending beyond the core course practice areas. A survey was given at the beginning and at the end of the course to measure the influence of course activities on first year students' aspirations for varied pharmacy careers. All students completed the survey but needed to opt into the research for data to be collected. Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Test, and descriptive statistics were used in data analysis. FINDINGS In this study of 508 first year pharmacy students, we found that 50.8% reported a change in their pharmacy career plans at the end of the course. Student interest in non-traditional career paths increased from 38.2% at the beginning of the course to 47.6% at the end of the course. As a result, students reported that they would select different electives (P < .001), pursue different pharmacy organizations (P = .0003), and explore new internship opportunities (P < .001). Overall, 98% found the course introduced them to pharmacy career paths they were previously unaware existed.

174,34799067,"Student perceptions of non-technical skills development during advanced pharmacy practice experiences. INTRODUCTION In today's workforce, non-technical skills (NTS) are essential in determining an employee's ability to fit into an organization. However, it is unknown whether pharmacy students consider these skills essential to their future work or believe they are sufficiently trained. Therefore, this study evaluated student perceptions of the value of NTS as a pharmacist and their satisfaction with NTS training. METHODS A 45-item survey was distributed to 111 fourth-year pharmacy students at Texas A&M College of Pharmacy in March 2019. Given the diverse nature of NTS, this study collected student perceptions about the 2016 Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education Standard 4 Key Elements: self-awareness, leadership, innovation, and professionalism. Results were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics. RESULTS Approximately 84% (n = 93) of students completed the survey. More students perceived professionalism as an important skill to have, followed by leadership, self-awareness, and innovation. Similar results were shown with students' satisfaction with NTS training. Also, results highlighted that students' satisfaction level with their NTS training and their belief regarding their strengths relied on two factors: the number of advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) where NTS training occurred and the amount of time spent practicing the NTS. CONCLUSION These data add to the existing literature to support NTS training in experiential pharmacy education. While APPEs should not be the only setting where these skills are practiced in the curriculum, our study's findings may further guide curricular priorities and assessment strategies for NTS in the experiential setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
175,34799068,"Student perceptions of an academic introductory pharmacy practice experience. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Many pharmacists have found a career in academia to be meaningful and fulfilling, and pharmacy schools have traditionally utilized academic advanced pharmacy practice experiences to prepare their students to enter into this field. This article describes the design, implementation, and perceptions of an academic introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE). EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Eighteen second professional year students and six third professional year students completed the IPPE between 2017 and 2019. Throughout these experiences, students engaged in teaching activities, developed presentation skills, and were educated on various aspects of life in academia. IPPE students completed evaluations of the preceptor and rotation using a standardized evaluation form. FINDINGS Collective student feedback indicated that IPPE students found the rotation to be a positive and meaningful experience, with highlights including opportunities to expand their understanding of careers in academia and to challenge themselves to develop and refine their teaching skills. SUMMARY The successful implementation of this academic IPPE may provide an impetus for other pharmacy schools to develop similar rotations. Challenges associated with precepting such a rotation should be noted, and a quantitative assessment of the rotation can be considered for future offerings. This initiative demonstrated that an academic IPPE can provide students early in their pharmacy education meaningful insight into the teaching and learning process and assist with associated skill development.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
176,34799069,"A community-based partnership collaborative practice agreement project to disseminate and implement evidence-based practices in community pharmacy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The objective of this study is to explore the impact of an educational intervention including (1) collaborative practice agreement (CPA)-focused lecture and (2) a student project in partnership with a community-based pharmacy on dissemination and implementation of CPAs in community pharmacy practice. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING A CPA-focused classroom lecture and related project were given to five sequential years of second-year pharmacy students enrolled in a community pharmacy elective course. Community pharmacist feedback provided at the completion of the project was compared to present-day data collected via telephone survey. Responses for each survey question were summarized using frequencies, and chi-square analysis was conducted to assess the association between pharmacist perceptions at the time of the project vs. the present day. FINDINGS Forty-seven projects representing 47 unique CPAs were completed over five sequential years of the course. The most commonly targeted disease states by CPAs were influenza/streptococcus pharyngitis (25.5%), therapeutic interchange (6.4%), oral contraceptives (6.4%), and tobacco cessation (6.4%). Pharmacists noted that students facilitated their progress toward CPA implementation by serving as a means for CPA law education (23.4%) and by saving time in CPA development (12.8%). SUMMARY This study demonstrated that a student project partnering with a local community pharmacy improved knowledge dissemination but did not have any direct impact on implementation of CPAs in a community pharmacy. However, students may have a role in dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practices, such as CPAs, when appropriately matched to setting-specific implementation barriers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
177,34799070,"An interprofessional activity involving pharmacy and physician assistant students aimed at reinforcing the patient care process. BACKGROUND Pharmacy students should have the opportunity to practice applying the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP) in an interprofessional environment. The purpose of this study was to compare the change in students' confidence in their ability to complete the five steps of the PPCP before and after participation in an interprofessional activity involving physician assistant (PA) students. INTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION ACTIVITY Second-year pharmacy students and second-year PA students completed an activity in teams of six (four pharmacy and two PA students per team) in which they applied the PPCP to a patient case to create a plan of care. Students completed a pre- and a post-survey regarding their confidence in completing the PPCP and their attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration, as well as a program evaluation after completion of the activity. DISCUSSION There were 117 pharmacy and 58 PA students divided into 29 interprofessional teams. Of those, 99 (85%) pharmacy and 52 (90%) PA students completed both surveys. There was a statistically significant increase in confidence to perform the PPCP for all students, with a large effect size. There were no changes in attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration. Overall, the program evaluation reflected the activity was rated highly by students. IMPLICATIONS The interprofessional activity demonstrated a positive effect on students' self-reported confidence in their ability to complete steps of the PPCP.

178,34799071,"Lessons learned: Assessing team creation by personality inventories in pharmacy students. BACKGROUND Proper team formation is critical for team performance and dynamics in the setting of team-based learning (TBL). Faculty should stratify students to ensure an even allocation of learner resources; however, the ideal method of team creation for TBL in pharmacy education has yet to be determined. A study aimed to assess team formation stratified by personality strengths on student performance for graded team activities, peer evaluations, and student perceptions of team dynamics compared to randomization of teams the previous semester with the same cohort. This Live and Learn piece will describe lessons learned throughout this project and research considerations for future studies on TBL team creation. IMPACT The study design compared team stratification by strengths vs. randomization, which resulted in similar distribution of CliftonStrengths domains with a variation of two teams between the semesters. Due to homogeneity in student strengths and negligible difference in purposeful team creation by strengths vs. randomization, the study was limited in its methodology and findings. RECOMMENDATIONS Through the description of this experience, the authors have outlined suggestions for designing studies to explore team creation methods, specifically capturing preliminary data, including a control group, and recognizing the influence of randomization. DISCUSSION Future studies to identify the optimal method for team formation may include alternate stratification approaches and should be performed over multiple cohorts from varying institutions. It is equally plausible that randomization consistently generates teams with equitable resource distribution and team formation has no overall impact on TBL effectiveness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
179,34799259,"Perceptions and barriers to the annual influenza vaccine compared with the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in an urban underserved population. BACKGROUND For a vaccine to be successful, communities must perceive it as important, safe, effective, and necessary. However, there are many barriers and hesitancies to vaccination. Underserved patient populations may face additional challenges related to access and cost. Because community pharmacists improve vaccine access and increase vaccination rates, it is beneficial for pharmacists to understand perceptions and barriers to vaccinations in their community to increase vaccine confidence. OBJECTIVES This study aims to assess and compare barriers and perceptions of the annual influenza to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine for underserved patients of a charitable pharmacy. METHODS Patients who qualified to receive medications from an outpatient charitable pharmacy took an electronic survey when receiving medications. The survey incorporated questions developed by the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Vaccine Hesitancy on a 5-point Likert scale. Questions about the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines mirrored one another. Demographic data such as age, race, sex, and education level were also collected. RESULTS Of the 189 patients surveyed at the charitable pharmacy, 71.7% were 55 years old and older and 58.9% were female. Of note, 78% and 77% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, respectively, were important for the health of others in their community. Adverse effects and the cost of the COVID-19 vaccine were noted to be statistically significantly more of a concern with the COVID-19 vaccine than that of the influenza vaccine (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Ensuring equitable vaccine access, promoting the COVID-19 vaccine as free, and eliciting and addressing individual persons' concerns related to vaccine safety and adverse effects are all important ways pharmacists and other health care providers and community stakeholders can help promote vaccine confidence within the populations they serve.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
180,34799260,"Evaluation of quality measure attainment with pharmacist-delivered Medicare annual wellness visits. BACKGROUND Medicare is required to fully cover annual wellness visits (AWVs) to increase access to preventive care. As health care converts to pay for performance models, clinical quality measures have increasing importance. Few studies have investigated the effect of pharmacist-delivered AWVs on clinical quality measure attainment in a rural family medicine (FM) clinic setting. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to evaluate attainment of clinical quality measures for pharmacist-delivered AWVs compared with physician-delivered AWVs (usual care). Secondary objectives included assessment of the number and type of drug therapy problems (DTPs) identified by pharmacists during AWVs. METHODS This single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted within an FM clinic located in southwest Georgia. Two cohorts were created according to the provider of AWVs during 2017: pharmacist or physician-usual care. Data on quality measure eligibility, attainment, and DTPs (for the pharmacist group only) were collected through electronic chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize variables, and chi-square (or Fisher exact where appropriate) tests to compare the proportion of clinical quality measures attained between groups. RESULTS Among 334 delivered AWVs, pharmacists performed 68.6%. Approximately 62% of pharmacist and usual care visits were female with mean ages of 72 (SD +/- 9.1) and 62 (SD +/- 13.9) years, respectively. Pharmacist-delivered AWVs had statistically significant greater quality measure attainment in the following categories: advance care planning, osteoporosis cardiovascular screenings, and Tdap vaccinations compared with usual care (P < 0.05). Usual care had statistically significant greater quality measure attainment for diabetes screening. Seventy-five DTPs were identified in the pharmacist group, with the majority being related to adherence (39%). CONCLUSION Pharmacist-delivered AWVs had greater quality measure attainment in several areas than usual care. Furthermore, increased quality measure attainment may assist in meeting benchmarks set by payers to ensure ongoing reimbursement of these services.",1,1,0,0,0,"Outcome is attaintement of a metric, not patient outcome.",,,,,,,,,
181,34800417,"Safety and efficacy of erythropoietin for the treatment of patients with optic neuritis (TONE): a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled study. BACKGROUND The human cytokine erythropoietin conveys neuroprotection in animal models but has shown ambiguous results in phase 2 clinical trials in patients with optic neuritis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of erythropoietin in patients with optic neuritis as a clinically isolated syndrome in a multicentre, prospective, randomised clinical trial. METHODS This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial, conducted at 12 tertiary referral centres in Germany, included participants aged 18-50 years, within 10 days of onset of unilateral optic neuritis, with visual acuity of 0·5 or less, and without a previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 33 000 IU erythropoietin or placebo intravenously for 3 days as an adjunct to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg per day). Block randomisation was performed by the trial statistician using an SAS code that generated randomly varying block sizes, stratified by study site and distributed using sealed envelopes. All trial participants and all study staff were masked to treatment assignment, except the trial pharmacist. The first primary outcome was atrophy of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL), measured by optic coherence tomography (OCT) as the difference in pRNFL thickness between the affected eye at week 26 and the unaffected eye at baseline. The second primary outcome was low contrast letter acuity at week 26, measured as the 2·5% Sloan chart score of the affected eye. Analysis was performed in the full analysis set of all randomised participants for whom treatment was started and at least one follow-up OCT measurement was available. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01962571. FINDINGS 108 participants were enrolled between Nov 25, 2014, and Oct 9, 2017, of whom 55 were assigned to erythropoietin and 53 to placebo. Five patients were excluded from the primary analysis due to not receiving the allocated medication, withdrawn consent, revised diagnosis, or loss to follow-up, yielding a full analysis set of 52 patients in the erythropoietin group and 51 in the placebo group. Mean pRNFL atrophy was 15·93 μm (SD 14·91) in the erythropoietin group and 14·65 μm (15·60) in the placebo group (adjusted mean treatment difference 1·02 μm; 95% CI -5·51 to 7·55; p=0·76). Mean low contrast letter acuity scores were 49·60 (21·31) in the erythropoietin group and 49·06 (21·93) in the placebo group (adjusted mean treatment difference -4·03; -13·06 to 5·01). Adverse events occurred in 43 (81%) participants in the erythropoietin group and in 42 (81%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse event was headache, occuring in 15 (28%) patients in the erythropoietin group and 13 (25%) patients in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in eight (15%) participants in the erythropoietin and in four (8%) in the placebo group. One patient (2%) in the erythropoietin group developed a venous sinus thrombosis, which was treated with anticoagulants and resolved without sequelae. INTERPRETATION Erythropoietin as an adjunct to corticosteroids conveyed neither functional nor structural neuroprotection in the visual pathways after optic neuritis. Future research could focus on modified erythropoietin administration, assess its efficacy independent of corticosteroids, and investigate whether it affects the conversion of optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis.

INTRODUCTION Improving access to naloxone is an important public health strategy in the U.S. This study examines the state-level trends in naloxone dispensing from 2012 to 2019 for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. METHODS Data from IQVIA Xponent were used to examine the trends and geographic inequality in annual naloxone dispensing rates and the number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed per high-dose opioid prescription from 2012 to 2019 and from 2016 to 2019 to correspond with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain release. Annual percentage change was estimated using linear regression. Analyses were conducted in 2020. RESULTS Naloxone dispensing rates and the number of naloxone prescriptions per 100 high-dose opioid prescriptions increased from 2012 to 2019 across all states and the District of Columbia. Average state-level naloxone dispensing rates increased from 0.55 per 100,000 population in 2012 to 45.60 in 2016 and 292.31 in 2019. Similarly, the average number of naloxone prescriptions per 100 high-dose opioid prescriptions increased from 0.002 in 2012 to 0.24 in 2016 and 3.04 in 2019. Across both measures of naloxone dispensing, the geographic inequality gap increased during the study period. In 2019, the number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed per 100 high-dose opioid prescriptions ranged from 1.04 to 16.64 across states. CONCLUSIONS Despite increases in naloxone dispensing across all states, dispensing rates remain low, with substantial variation and increasing disparities over time at the state level. This information may be helpful in efforts to improve naloxone access and in designing state-specific intervention programs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
183,34802944,"Utilizing diagnostic pharmacists to support Family Medicine Walk-In clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, physician focus shifted from continuity of care to pandemic duties. However, patients still required in-person visits for acute or chronic complaints. Specially trained pharmacists were utilized to alleviate Family Medicine Walk-In (FMWI) provider shortages. OBJECTIVE To describe the innovative practice utilizing diagnostic pharmacists in FMWI, evaluate their impact on provider time, compare workload with traditional advanced practice providers (APPs), and evaluate type of visits and medications prescribed. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Pharmacists at an Indian Health Service medical center staffed FMWI 2.5 days per week to alleviate provider shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. The privileged pharmacist had a diagnostic scope like APPs. Non-privileged pharmacists provided care to patients utilizing current protocols and were required to present all new complaints to providers. PRACTICE INNOVATION The facility utilized pharmacists that have completed or were progressing through the local diagnostic training program to alleviate provider shortages. EVALUATION METHODS The absolute number of visits by pharmacists was determined and the number of provider hours shifted to pharmacy estimated. The number of visits by provider type was calculated and compared. ICD-10 codes were evaluated for purpose of visits. New prescriptions written by pharmacists were categorized and reimbursement rates determined. RESULTS Pharmacists were responsible for 677 visits during 88 clinic days, with an estimated 338 provider hours shifted to pharmacists. Pharmacists saw 5.8 patients per day, APPs 5.2, and physicians 5.7. Pharmacists primarily evaluated hypertension, diabetes, musculoskeletal, and infectious disease complaints. New prescription categories included pain management, endocrine, cardiovascular, and infectious disease. The single billable pharmacist was reimbursed $77,945. CONCLUSION Diagnostic pharmacists in FMWI have allowed providers to shift to other pandemic duties and demonstrate similar workload as APPs. Most visits and prescriptions fall within known pharmacist practice. Pharmacists in this setting pay for the existence of this position and remain integrated in FMWI.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
184,34802945,"Can the LACE index help identify uninsured patients at risk of loss to follow-up during a pharmacist-led transitions of care program? BACKGROUND Uninsured patients are susceptible to being lost to follow-up (LTFU). In addition to being uninsured, follow-up is especially critical among this population during transitions of care when patients are discharged from the hospital setting back to home because follow-up care after discharge has been proven to prevent readmissions. The LACE tool has historically been used to predict readmissions, but the LACE tool has not been used to evaluate patients' risk of LTFU. OBJECTIVE To understand the potential translation of the LACE tool for use in uninsured patients' follow-up care, we assessed the association between LACE index scores and patients' risk of LTFU during a pharmacist-led transitions of care program for uninsured patients. METHODS Data were extracted from a randomized controlled trial implementing a pharmacist-led transitions of care program at an indigent care clinic. The study population included uninsured adult patients (>18 years old) who spoke English and attended a clinical visit with a pharmacist within 16 days after discharge from a community hospital. Analyses sought to determine factors associated with the patients' LTFU status. RESULTS Among 88 enrolled participants, 29 participants (32.95%) were LTFU. Thirty-two patients (36.4%) had a high LACE index score at baseline, indicating an increased risk of 30-day readmission. Of the remaining 56 patients (63.6%) with low-to-moderate LACE index scores, 54 (61.4%) had a moderate LACE index score, and only 2 (2.3%) had a low LACE index score. Uninsured patients with high LACE index scores had 70% lower odds of being LTFU than uninsured patients with low-to-moderate LACE index scores (exact odds ratio 0.297 [95% CI 0.081-0.947]). CONCLUSION The LACE index score was inversely related to the risk of LTFU during a pharmacist-led transitions of care program. Pharmacists may use the LACE tool to identify patients at high risk of LTFU.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
185,34802958,"The role of clinical pharmacists in general practice in England: Impact, perspectives, barriers and facilitators. BACKGROUND By 2020/1 NHS England plans to invest over 100 m to ensure that there is one clinical pharmacist post in primary care for every 30,000 patients. A recent realist review identified key questions in the literature related to the implementation of a clinical pharmacist (CP) in a general practice role. These relate to the impact of the role, perspectives on the role (patients, GPs and pharmacists), and barriers and facilitators to the implementation process. The data collected in the national evaluation of the pilot scheme provides data to answer the realist questions identified. OBJECTIVES This paper examines the experience of implementing the clinical pharmacist in general practice role, in relation to the areas identified above. METHODS The research took a mixed methods approach to understanding the scheme implementation and this research draws on both survey and qualitative interview data from a wide range of stakeholders. RESULTS Pharmacists in the pilot phase are motivated to develop clinical skills and make a positive impact on patients. Data suggests that clinical pharmacists have a positive impact, in particular on health outcomes related to polypharmacy and long-term conditions. GPs have a broadly positive response to the CPs, in particular when they save time and money for the practice. However, GPs have to invest time in mentoring and building relationships to realise the benefits of the role. Patients appreciate the CP role for increasing access to a practitioner and providing expertise in medications. There are some barriers to successful implementation of the role, including policy and funding, lack of clarity around the role and lack of quantitative and economic validation of the role. Facilitators of success include supportive working relationships, integration and mentoring. CONCLUSION The pilot implementation of this new role was successful but there are lessons which can be learned for the success of future iterations and more work is required to economically validate the role which is likely to in turn generate positive relationships with GPs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

187,34803008,"Situation analysis of antimicrobial resistance control, policy and regulation - a reflection of Pakistan.  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat that affects 700,000 lives every year and could lead to 10 million deaths every year by 2050. World Health Organization (WHO) has instituted a global action plan in 2015 to deal antimicrobial resistance in the 68th World Health Assembly. This paper aimed to review the situation analysis of current bottlenecks of the health system and provision of recommendations to improve the current regulatory mechanism for antimicrobial drugs in Pakistan. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) emerged as a threat practically in all nations of the world including Pakistan which is the world's sixth most populous country. This qualitative document analysis has been done by using Pakistan's National Policy on AMR. In 2004, total expenditure on pharmaceuticals was 1844 million US$ with a total pharmaceutical expenditure per capita of 11.3US$. Total number of pharmacists licensed was10,000 technician and assists were 20,000 and licensed pharmacies were 7000. There are only 0.9 pharmacists per 100000 populations are deployed. The health system and society are at risk of an emerging epidemic of AMR. This investigational analysis of AMR control, policy and regulation in Pakistan highlights some facts about misuse, availability of over the counter medicine, self-medications and low effect of existing approaches. Drug prescription monitoring law and policy investment is needed in the regulation of drugs to reduce unnecessary drug consumption and prescription, and strengthening quality parameters at several levels to control epidemic of AMR.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
188,34805718,"Lessons Learned From Implementing a Novel Bayesian Adaptive Dose-Finding Design in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. PURPOSE Novel Bayesian adaptive designs provide an effective way to improve clinical trial efficiency. These designs are superior to conventional methods, but implementing them can be challenging. The aim of this article was to describe what we learned while applying a novel Bayesian phase I-II design in a recent trial. METHODS The primary goal of the trial was to optimize radiation therapy (RT) dose among three levels (low, standard, and high), given either with placebo (P) or an investigational agent (A), for treating locally advanced, radiation-naive pancreatic cancer, deemed appropriate for RT rather than surgery. Up to 48 patients were randomly assigned fairly between RT plus P and RT plus A, with RT dose-finding done within each arm using the late-onset efficacy-toxicity design on the basis of two coprimary end points, tumor response and dose-limiting toxicity, both evaluated at up to 90 days. The random assignment was blinded, but within each arm, unblinded RT doses were chosen adaptively using software developed within the institution. RESULTS Implementing the design involved double-blind balance-restricted random assignment, real-time assessment of patient outcomes to evaluate the efficacy-toxicity trade-off for each RT dose in each arm to optimize each patient's RT dose adaptively, and transition from a single-center trial to a multicenter trial. We present lessons learned and illustrative documentation. CONCLUSION Implementing novel Bayesian adaptive trial designs requires close collaborations between physicians, pharmacists, statisticians, data managers, and sponsors. The process is difficult but manageable and essential for efficient trial conduct. Close collaboration during trial conduct is a key component of any trial that includes real-time adaptive decision rules.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
189,34805778,"Characterizing the reach of comprehensive medication management in a population health primary care model. Introduction As care teams adopt team-based models of care, it is important to examine the reach of interdisciplinary services, such as pharmacists providing comprehensive medication management (CMM). This study examined the reach of pharmacist-delivered CMM in the first 10 months of a population health-focused primary care transformation (PCT). Methods Using electronic health record data, descriptive statistics (counts and percentages, as well as means and standard deviations) were quantified to summarize the patients who received CMM in two PCT pilot clinics pre- and post-PCT. Results Patients who had at least one CMM visit increased from 554 during the pre-PCT window to 880 during the post-PCT window. However, when adjusted for the increased pharmacist full-time equivalents (FTE) included as part of the PCT, 462 and 330 patients/FTE were seen in the pre- vs post-PCT periods, respectively. When calculating the percentage of patients who received CMM, this increased from 2.3% of all primary care patients seen in the two pilot clinics before the PCT began to 4.4% after the PCT was implemented. Most patient demographics remained largely the same between the pre- and post-PCT periods. However, CMM patients seen in the post-PCT period had more medication therapy problems across all medication therapy problem categories compared to patients in the pre-PCT period. Additionally, patients receiving CMM had significantly more conditions and medications and higher hospitalizations and emergency department use compared to the general clinic population. Conclusions Reach is an important implementation outcome to determine the representativeness of individuals participating in a given service. This study illustrates that pharmacists providing CMM see complex patients with a high propensity for medication therapy problems. However, opportunities exist to improve the reach of CMM and, in turn, enhance team-based care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
190,34806569,"Specialized training in hospital pharmacy: an overview of the concerns, needs and current situation of resident tutors. OBJECTIVE To provide new insight into the training needs and resources required by hospital pharmacy resident tutors in Spain, as well as  into their level of motivation and satisfaction with their teaching. Method: Google Forms® was used to design a survey addressed to hospital pharmacy resident tutors between January and March 2019. They survey consisted of generic (tutor, hospital, service) and specific  questions (available resources, teaching activities, teaching satisfaction,  training needs). A univariate exploratory analysis was conducted to study  possible factors related to teaching satisfaction and motivation. Results: Replies were received from 83 tutors (rate of response: 52.8%), from  15/17 Spanish regions. The annual resident/tutor ratio was 4 (IQR = 2- 4). A total of 96.4% of tutors conducted interviews, of whom 65.1% did so  quarterly. Other activities included the management of external training  rotations (97.6%), planning of rotations (97.6%) and annual  appraisals  (96.4%). Only 17.1% of respondents were given time off their regular duties  for their tutorship work, with 71.4% stating that the time they were allowed  was insufficient. A total of 70.7% of tutors from eight Spanish regions where  the granting of protected time was regulated said were not given any time off  for their teaching endeavors. Most tutors declared to be satisfied (66.7%) and  motivated (63%) with their teaching work. Motivation appeared to fall with  age, and both motivation and satisfaction decreased as a function of the tutors'  years of professional experience and when they were given no time off  for their tutorship work or when the remuneration was low, without any  relationship being identified between these factors. Tutors pointed out that work should be done to increase the number of hours assigned to tutorships  (78%), preparing SEFH-validated training plans (76.8%), improving teaching  techniques (65.9%), and decreasing the clinical workload (62.2%). Over the  past 3 years, 69.1% of tutors had received training. This training was arranged  by educational committees (63.3%), the Spanish regional authorities  (42.4%) and SEFH (13.6%). All the training in clinical, teaching, and communicative competencies enjoyed wide acceptance (&gt; 90%). The  preferred delivery method was hybrid (partly on-line and partly onsite)  (64.6%). CONCLUSIONS SEFH's tutors' group conducted its first national survey  addressed to hospital pharmacy resident tutors. The survey showed that, although tutors are highly satisfied with their teaching activities, they  ould like more training and to be able to devote more time to their tutorship work. It was also shown that a regulatory framework needs to be  implemented in various Spanish regions and that compliance with existing  regional regulations must be improved.  Objetivo: Conocer las necesidades formativas y de recursos de los tutores de  formación especializada de farmacia hospitalaria de España, así como su  motivación y satisfacción con la docencia.Método: Se realizó, mediante Google-forms®, una encuesta dirigida a tutores  de farmacia hospitalaria durante enero-marzo de 2019 con preguntas generales (tutor, hospital, servicio) y específicas (medios  disponibles, actividades docentes, satisfacción con la docencia, necesidades  formativas). Se realizó un análisis exploratorio univariante para estudiar  posibles factores relacionados con la satisfacción y la motivación docente. Resultados: Respondieron 83 tutores (tasa de respuesta: 52,8%), de 15/17  comunidades autónomas. El número de residentes/año-tutor resultó 4 (rango  intercuartílico = 2-4). El 96,4% realizan entrevistas (trimestrales [65,1%]- ninguna [3,6%]. También se ocupan principalmente de la gestión de rotaciones  externas [97,6%], planificación de rotaciones  [97,6%] y la  evaluación anual [96,4%]). El 17,1% dispone de horas para la docencia  insuficientes para el 71,4%. Un 70,7% de los tutores de ocho comunidades  autónomas con normativa sobre el tiempo de liberación carecen de dicho  tiempo. Los tutores se declararon mayoritariamente satisfechos con la docencia  (66,7%) y motivados (63,0%). Parece que la motivación desciende  con la edad, y que motivación y satisfacción disminuyen con los años como  tutor y como especialista, también son menores en ausencia de liberación o  retribución económica, sin haberse podido demostrar asociación. Los tutores  seleccionaron como acciones de mejora: aumento de dedicación horaria  (78%), planes formativos validados por la Sociedad Española de Farmacia  Hospitalaria (76,8%), mejorar técnicas pedagógicas (65,9%) y menor carga  asistencial (62,2%). En los últimos 3 años el 69,1% recibió formación. La  formación fue organizada por la Comisión de Docencia (63,3%), comunidades  autónomas (42,4%) y Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria (13,6%). La  formación propuesta en competencias clínicas, docentes y de comunicación  fue ampliamente aceptada (&gt; 90%). El formato docente  preferido fue semipresencial (64,6%).Conclusiones: El Grupo de Tutores de la Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria ha realizado la primera encuesta nacional dirigida a  tutores de farmacia hospitalaria. La encuesta muestra que, aunque la satisfacción con la actividad docente es elevada, los tutores demandan más tiempo de dedicación y una mayor formación.

191,34806570,"The role of the pharmacist within an immune-mediated inflammatory disease unit: Results of a survey of healthcare providers and patients. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the importance and need for pharmacists to expand  their role to new activities and to promote and maintain others they already  carried out prior to the implementation of a new Immunemediated Inflammatory Diseases Unit to be created in our hospital; to prioritize the new activities incorporated based on the results obtained. METHOD This was a single center cross-sectional based on a survey  administered during January 2020 to all clinical healthcare providers due to be part of the new unit, as well as to a sample of patients. It was structured into two categories: actions related to patients' pharmaceutical  care, and actions related to practitioners of the Immune-mediated  Inflammatory Diseases Unit. Each item was assigned a score from 0 to 10,  where 10 indicated maximum interest or need. A prioritization template was  applied to quantify and evaluate each activity and implement the new ones in  order of priority. RESULTS A total of 90 responses were obtained (30 from patients and 60 from  healthcare workers). An analysis was performed of the median scores of each  of the 20 activities proposed, which ranged between 8 and 10 points. When  comparing the scores obtained, it was observed that more statistically  significant differences were obtained in the pharmacists vs doctors group than  in the pharmacists vs nurses group, or the pharmacists vs patients one. After  prioritization, the first action taken was to implement electronic prescriptions  for outpatients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. CONCLUSIONS The survey revealed the expectations of healthcare providers and patients regarding the role pharmacists should play in the newly created unit and provided an insight into the most valued activities. This information will be useful in prioritizing the implementation of the new activities to be carried out by the unit.  Objetivo: Evaluar el interés y necesidad de que el farmacéutico desarrolle nuevas actividades propuestas, y potenciar o mantener otras que ya se realizaban, antes de que la futura Unidad de Enfermedades Inflamatorias Inmunomediadas inicie su actividad en nuestro hospital. Además, priorizar la incorporación de las nuevas actividades en base a los  resultados obtenidos.Método: Diseño observacional transversal unicéntrico mediante una encuesta  realizada en enero de 2020 a todos los profesionales sanitarios de los servicios  clínicos implicados y a una muestra de pacientes, y estructurada en dos  categorías: Acciones orientadas a la atención farmacéutica al paciente y  Acciones orientadas a los profesionales de dicha Unidad. Cada ítem se puntuó  de 0 a 10, siendo 10 el máximo interés/necesidad. Se aplicó una matriz de  priorización para cuantificar y evaluar cada actividad e implantar las nuevas  por orden de priorización.Resultados: Se completaron 90 encuestas (30 de pacientes y 60 de profesionales). Se analizaron las medianas obtenidas de cada una de las 20  actividades propuestas, alcanzándose valores entre 8 y 10. Se compararon valores: en el grupo de farmacéuticos versus médicos se  obtuvieron más ítems con diferencias estadísticamente significativas que en el grupo farmacéuticos versus enfermería, o farmacéuticos versus pacientes. Tras la priorización, la primera acción fue implantar la prescripción electrónica en pacientes externos con enfermedades inflamatorias inmunomediadas.Conclusiones: La encuesta ha permitido conocer las expectativas de los  profesionales sanitarios y pacientes sobre la actividad del farmacéutico en  dicha Unidad, cuantificar las actividades más valoradas y priorizar la  implantación de nuevas actividades.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
192,34806571,"Improvement of outpatient pharmacy through patient participation and Lean methodology. OBJECTIVE To improve the quality of the dispensing process and  pharmaceutical care in the Outpatient Pharmacy through patient participation and Lean methodology, and to analyse the results obtained in  terms of efficiency and patient satisfaction. METHOD Prospective observational single-centre study. A working group was  organized with the health care staff involved in outpatient care to apply Lean  methodology and detect improvement opportunities. We used a focus group  technique to understand the patients' experience. The impact on patient  satisfaction was measured through a mass survey mailed out in December  2019 (before introducing the main measures) and in December 2020. RESULTS More than 30 improvement actions were identified after surveying the opinions of the patients and health care staff involved. Nine actions were prioritized, which were mainly related to structural and circuit changes. Waiting times significantly improved (35% of patients waited for more than 30 minutes before the improvement actions vs 4.5% afterward). The results showed that waiting times and overall  satisfaction significantly improved in the period between the two surveys. In both cases, the degree of satisfaction was higher after introducing the improvement actions. CONCLUSIONS We analysed the situation of our Outpatient Service and designed the most appropriate improvement actions according to the resources available. This initiative was achieved through patient  participation (via a focus group and mass surveys), the participation of health  care staff, and the application of Lean methodology.  Objetivo: Mejorar la calidad del proceso de dispensación y atención farmacéutica a pacientes externos mediante la participación del  paciente y la aplicación de la metodología Lean y analizar los resultados  obtenidos en cuanto a eficiencia e impacto en la satisfacción de los pacientes. Método: Estudio observacional, prospectivo y unicéntrico. Se creó un grupo de  trabajo con los diferentes profesionales implicados en la atención al  paciente externo para aplicar la metodología Lean y detectar oportunidades de  mejora. Para conocer la experiencia del paciente se utilizó la técnica del grupo  focal. El impacto en la satisfacción de los pacientes se midió mediante  encuestas de satisfacción que se enviaron a través del correo electrónico en  diciembre de 2019 (antes de implantar las principales medidas) y en diciembre  de 2020.Resultados: Teniendo en cuenta la perspectiva de los pacientes y de los  profesionales sanitarios, se identificaron más de 30 acciones de mejora de las  que se priorizaron 9, relacionadas fundamentalmente con cambios  estructurales y de circuitos. Se consiguió mejorar significativamente los  tiempos de espera (el 35% de los pacientes esperaban más de 30 minutos  frente al 4,5% en el análisis realizado después de las intervenciones). Los  aspectos que mostraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en las  encuestas entre los dos periodos fueron el tiempo de espera y la satisfacción  global, en ambos casos el grado de satisfacción fue superior una vez  implantadas las acciones de mejora.Conclusiones: La participación del paciente, a través del grupo focal y  encuestas masivas, unido a la participación de los profesionales sanitarios implicados en el proceso, a través de la metodología Lean, ha permitido analizar la realidad de nuestro servicio y diseñar las acciones de  mejora más adecuadas en función de los recursos disponibles.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
193,34806574,"Interaction between valproic acid and meropenem or ertapenem in patients with epilepsy: clinical relevance and results from pharmaceutical intervention. OBJECTIVE The literature has described the interaction between valproic acid  and carbapenems. This interaction leads to decreases in plasma concentrations  of valproic acid. The main objectives of this study were  to assess its relevance in clinical practice, to identify variables associated with  increased seizure episode rates, and to analyse the impact of pharmaceutical intervention on avoiding the effects of this interaction. METHOD An observational retrospective study of inpatients with epilepsy  admitted between 2016 and 2020. Their pharmacological treatment throughout  admission was recorded, and the presence of other interactions  leading to decreased plasma concentrations of valproic acid was reviewed. The  seizure rate during the year prior to admission was compared to that during  the interaction period. For every episode in which the interaction was detected, an intervention was conducted by providing the prescriber with information on  the interaction and suggesting a change of antibiotherapy as well as the  pharmacokinetic monitoring of valproic acid. RESULTS 37 episodes were included. 58.1% of the patients were male and  median age was 70 years. In total, 56.8% of the patients received meropenem  and 43.2% received ertapenem. The median duration of  concomitant treatment with valproic acid and carbapenem was 4 days. The  incidence rate ratio was 2.60 (95% confidence interval: 1.61-4.21). Thus, this  interaction was associated with a higher seizure rate. A statistically significant  association was found between higher seizure rates and patients treated with  more than one anti-epileptic drug. Hospital pharmacists detected 24 episodes  (64.9%). In total, 17 interventions (70.8%) were accepted and 13  combinations were discontinued. Pharmacokinetic monitoring was conducted in  13 episodes (35.1%) and infratherapeutic levels were found in all of them. CONCLUSIONS The interaction between valproic acid and meropenem or ertapenem is clinically relevant. It is recommended that this combination should be avoided provided that a viable alternative is available.  Pharmaceutical intervention may contribute to preventing seizures associated with this combination.  Objetivo: La interacción entre ácido valproico y carbapenems está descrita en  la literatura y conlleva una disminución de los niveles plasmáticos de ácido  valproico. Los objetivos son evaluar su relevancia en la práctica clínica, conocer  las variables que se asocian a un incremento de crisis epilépticas y  analizar el impacto de la intervención farmacéutica para evitar las  consecuencias de dicha interacción.Método: En este estudio observacional retrospectivo se estudiaron pacientes  con epilepsia hospitalizados entre 2016 y 2020. Se registró el tratamiento  farmacológico prescrito en el ingreso y se revisó la presencia de otras  interacciones que redujeran la concentración plasmática de ácido valproico. La  frecuencia de crisis epilépticas durante el año previo al ingreso se comparó con  la correspondiente al periodo de interacción. Se realizó una intervención  en todos los episodios con la interacción detectada informando al prescriptor  sobre la interacción y proponiendo sustitución de la antibioterapia, así como  monitorización farmacocinética de ácido valproico.Resultados: Se incluyeron 37 episodios. El 58,1% eran varones y la mediana  de edad fue de 70 años. El 56,8% de los pacientes recibió meropenem y el  43,2% restante, ertapenem. Para la duración del tratamiento concomitante  entre ácido valproico y el carbapenem prescrito  se obtuvo una mediana de 4  días. Se halló una razón de tasas de incidencia de 2,60 (intervalo de confianza  del 95%: 1,61-4,21), por lo que esta interacción se asocia a una mayor  frecuencia de crisis epilépticas. Se asoció una mayor frecuencia de crisis  estadísticamente significativa en los pacientes tratados con más de un fármaco  antiepiléptico. Los farmacéuticos hospitalarios detectaron 24  episodios (64,9%). Se aceptaron 17 intervenciones farmacéuticas (70,8%) y  se suprimieron 13 combinaciones. Se realizó monitorización farmacocinética en  13 episodios (35,1%) y en todos se hallaron niveles infraterapéuticos. Conclusiones: La interacción entre ácido valproico y meropenem o ertapenem  es clínicamente relevante y se recomienda evitarla siempre que  existan alternativas viables.

195,34806583,"Knowledge, perceptions, attitude, barriers and facilitators of biosimilars use across specialty physicians and hospital pharmacists: A national survey. OBJECTIVE To analyze knowledge, perceptions, attitude, barriers and facilitators of biosimilars uptake across physicians managing immune diseases and hospital pharmacists. METHOD Two structured and closed anonymous online surveys were designed and sent to 41 physicians (rheumatologists, dermatologists, gastroenterologists) and 32 hospital pharmacists.  Sociodemographic and clinical practice related variables were collected. We also gathered information about biosimilars knowledge and importance,  access, attitude in clinical practice and perceptions, barriers and facilitators to biosimilars uptake. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS Surveys response rate was 100% (hospital pharmacists) and 96% (physicians). We found certain lack of biosimilars knowledge  about key aspects including switching, extrapolation, interchangeability or  substitution. There was a great variability in the types and brands of  biosimilars depending on the hospital. We observed several organization  preferences, policies, and practices regarding biosimilars. General  perception and attitude to biosimilars was positive. If used, biosimilars  were predominantly prescribed in biologic treatment-naive patients (this  indication was considered adequate and participants felt comfortable with  it). Reluctance to switch in clinical practice was common. The main  barriers to biosimilars uptake were the lack of confidence and knowledge.  The main facilitators were the development of recommendations from  professional associations and societies and the demonstration of  interchangeability efficacy. We gathered concerns about biosimilar long  term efficacy and safety, lack of real-life data, lack of biosimilars  traceability or the risk of biologic reference medicines stock shortages. CONCLUSIONS Biosimilar education and more evidence filling current gaps  might help increase prescriber knowledge, comfort and use of biosimilars.  Objetivo: Analizar el conocimiento, las percepciones, la actitud, las barreras y los facilitadores sobre el uso de los biosimilares entre los  médicos que manejan enfermedades inmunológicas y los farmacéuticos de hospital.Método: Se diseñaron dos encuestas online anónimas, estructuradas y  cerradas que se enviaron a 41 médicos (reumatólogos, dermatólogos y  gastroenterólogos) y 32 farmacéuticos de hospital. Se recogieron variables sociodemográficas y relacionadas con la práctica clínica. También  información sobre el nivel de conocimiento e importancia de los  biosimilares, el acceso a los mismos, la actitud en la práctica clínica, y las  percepciones, barreras y facilitadores con el uso de los mismos. Se realizó  un análisis descriptivo.Resultados: La tasa de respuesta fue del 100% (farmacéuticos de  hospital) y del 96% (médicos). Encontramos cierta falta de conocimiento  sobre los biosimilares en aspectos clave como el cambio de un biológico de referencia a un biosimilar, la extrapolación de indicaciones, la  intercambiabilidad o la sustitución. Hubo una gran variabilidad en los tipos  y marcas comerciales de biosimilares entre hospitales. Observamos  distintas preferencias, políticas y prácticas en los hospitales en relación  con el uso de biosimilares. La percepción y actitud general hacia los  biosimilares fue positiva. Los biosimilares se prescribían  predominantemente en pacientes sin tratamiento bioló gico previo (esta  indicación se consideraba adecuada y los participantes se sentían cómodos con ella). La reticencia al cambio en la práctica clínica fue común. Los  principales obstáculos para el uso de biosimilares fueron la falta de  confianza y de conocimientos. Los principales facilitadores el desarrollo de recomendaciones de asociaciones y sociedades científicas y la  demostración de la eficacia de la intercambiabilidad. Se recogieron  preocupaciones sobre la eficacia y seguridad a largo plazo de los  biosimilares, la falta de datos en vida real, la falta de trazabilidad de los  biosimilares o el riesgo de escasez de existencias de medicamentos  biológicos de referencia.Conclusiones: Actividades formativas en biosimilares y una mayor  evidencia podrían ayudar a aumentar el conocimiento, comodidad y el uso de los biosimilares por parte de los prescriptores.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
196,34806587,"Pharmaceutical humanitarian assistance in the establishment of a drug compounding laboratory in a refugee camp.  In 1992 Medicus Mundi Mediterrània and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic spearheaded a cooperation project to set up a small  drug compounding laboratory in the Sahrawi refugee camps located in the desert town of Rabouni (Algeria's Tindouf province). The goal of the  project was to build a drug compounding facility, create a training center  for local staff, and ensure local production of medicines in cases of  inadequate supply.With the help of external experts and of multiple public and private organizations and institutions, a small compounding laboratory was established with separate work areas, similar to the lines of the  laboratories found in Spanish hospitals. The laboratory now has a stable team of 10-12 pharmacy technicians led by a pharmacist. In the  last 25 years, 40 Sahrawis have been trained through internships in  hospital pharmacy departments abroad, visits to drug compounding labs in other countries, tutoring, and ongoing training programs. Products that  can be compounded in the laboratory include capsules, oral solutions,  creams and ointments, topical solutions, eye drops, and sterile irrigation  and lavage solutions. Over fifty different formulations of varying degrees of complexity have been prepared. One of the most significant challenges, given the political situation and the geographical environment, has been  the procurement and transportation of the active ingredients and the packaging materials/equipment required for the compounding process. After 25 years of continuous work, this project is now a reality thanks to the effort and direct involvement of the Sahrawi people. The experience gained in the last few years has shown the importance of coordinating drug preparation with local prescribing physicians, as well as having quality standards and facilities with homologated low complexity basic equipment that allows, in other areas that is required, the replication of this model.  En 1992, Medicus Mundi Mediterrània y la República Árabe Saharaui Democrática iniciaron un proyecto de cooperación para el  establecimiento de un pequeño laboratorio de producción de  medicamentos en los campamentos de refugiados del pueblo saharaui,  situado en pleno desierto del Sahara, concretamente en Rabuni, Tindouf  (Argelia). Los objetivos del proyecto fueron establecer una estructura e  instalaciones que permitieran la elaboración de medicamentos, crear un  centro de formación de personal local y facilitar cierta capacidad de  producción en situaciones de crisis o emergencia ante la falta de  medicamentos.Mediante el asesoramiento externo y la ayuda de múltiples organizaciones, instituciones y entidades privadas, se construyó un  pequeño laboratorio de características similares al que teníamos en los  hospitales españoles, con áreas diferenciadas de trabajo. El laboratorio  dispone de un equipo humano estable de 10-12 técnicos superiores de  farmacia dirigidos por un farmacéutico.A lo largo de estos 25 años se han formado y capacitado 40 saharauis, a través de estancias externas en servicios de farmacia, visitas a  laboratorios de producción de otros países, tutorización de farmacéuticos y cursos de formación continuada. Se han incluido varias líneas de  producción de medicamentos como: cápsulas, soluciones orales, cremas y  pomadas, soluciones tópicas, colirios, soluciones de irrigación y lavado  estériles. Se han elaborado más de 50 formulaciones distintas, todas ellas de diferente grado de complejidad.

197,34806588,"Patient and health practitioner perceptions about the role of hospital pharmacists along the care continuum: the Fharmaconectados Project. OBJECTIVE To determine the perception of patients and practitioners regarding the role of the hospital pharmacist along the care  continuum. METHOD This was a multicenter cross-sectional observational analytical study, carried out in two phases between 15 October and 31  December 2020. In the first phase, a literature search was carried out to  identify specific questionnaires that measured the overall satisfaction of  patients in relation to the work of hospital pharmacists. Subsequently, a  specific consensus-based questionnaire was developed, structured into  three areas: care, relationships, and capacity-building and training. The  study included patients treated in the participating centers and served by  patient associations. They had to be older than 18 years, present with a  chronic condition, and be treated with medication for hospital use. In the  second phase, a qualitative study was carried out using focus group  discussions to analyze how hospital pharmacists are perceived and how  they would like to be recognized by patients. Four meetings were held in  different territories of Spain. Previously, the research team agreed on the  questions to be asked, which were grouped into four sections: healthcare,  relational, training and information. RESULTS A total of 482 surveys were obtained. The percentage of patients  who expressed a positive view of the role of the hospital  pharmacist was 88.0% (n = 424). In the multivariate analysis, the most  positive  opinions about these professionals were expressed by women and by patients who had received previous care in the hospital, those who had  a high opinion of the coordination of these professionals with the rest of  the care team, and those who had received the greatest amount of  emotional support. Integration of the pharmacist with the healthcare team  was found to vary across different hospitals and the hospitals' public image  we seen to be related to the way they were pharmacoeconomically  managed. In the sections related to capacity-building and training and  challenges for the future, respondents emphasized the need to promote  the introduction of new patient monitoring technologies. CONCLUSIONS Patients have a good opinion of the service provided by hospital pharmacists, although many are unaware of the significance of  their role.

198,34806908,"Payer perceptions on the use of patient-reported outcomes in oncology decision making.  BACKGROUND: In oncology, especially with accelerated regulatory approvals and niche populations, US payers appreciate all evidence that can help support formulary decision making, including evidence beyond traditional safety and efficacy data from clinical trials. Research suggests payers incorporate patient-reported outcome (PRO) evidence in their decision making and expect the importance of PRO evidence to grow. Greater understanding on payers' use of PRO information in oncology is needed. OBJECTIVE: To assess US payer perceptions regarding the use of PRO evidence in informing oncology formulary decision making. METHODS: A multidisciplinary steering committee involving a measurement specialist, health economics and outcomes research experts, and payers developed a survey containing single-answer, multiple-answer, and free-response questions. The pilot survey was tested at a mini-advisory board with 5 US payers and revised based on feedback. In February 2020, the survey was distributed to 221 US payers through the AMCP Market Insights program and 10 additional payer panelists who were invited to discuss and contextualize the survey results. Results were presented primarily as frequencies of responses and evaluated by plan size, type of health plan, and geography (regional vs national). Differences in categorical data responses were compared using Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact tests. Two-tailed values are reported and a P value less than or equal to 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Overall, 106 of 231 payers (45.9%) completed the survey; 45.5% represented small plans (< 1 million lives), and 54.5% represented large plans (≥ 1 million lives). Respondents were largely pharmacists (89.9%), with 55.6% of all respondents indicating their job was pharmacy administrator. The majority of payers (60.0% of small health plans and 57.8% of large plans) felt PRO evidence from clinical trials is useful. Similarly, the majority of payers (57.8% of small plans and 51.9% of large plans) felt PRO evidence from real-world studies is useful. Almost half (47.1%) suggested formulary review would be influenced by a lack of PRO evidence from oncology clinical trials either somewhat, much, or a great deal. Most payers (78.2%) thought PRO evidence is useful for providing additional context for safety of oncology therapies. More than one-third of payers (34.3%) valued PRO evidence when comparing 2 similar therapies, and 51.5% felt PRO evidence may help in measuring value for value-based agreements. Panelists indicated PRO evidence can be useful for developing treatment pathways for addressing health-related quality of life, informing provider-patient dialogues, and defining progression-free survival length and quality. CONCLUSIONS: US payers view PRO evidence from both clinical trials and real-world studies as useful for supplementing traditional clinical trial data when making oncology formulary decisions and for refining treatment pathways and care delivery models. Manufacturers of oncology therapies should collect and consider leveraging PRO evidence from both settings when engaging with US payers.

199,34807365,"""A little bit more looking…listening and feeling"" A qualitative interview study exploring advanced clinical practice in primary care and community pharmacy.  Background Growing demands on healthcare globally, combined with workforce shortages, have led to greater skill mix in healthcare settings. Pharmacists are increasingly moving into complex areas of practice, a move supported by policy and education/training changes. Aim To understand the nature of extended roles for pharmacists practising at an advanced level in primary care and community pharmacy settings, to explore how clinical and physical examination was incorporated into practice and to understand the impact of providing such examination on practice and on patient relationships. Method Telephone interviews (N = 15) were conducted with a purposive sample of pharmacists using clinical and physical examination in their practice in Great Britain. The sample included primary care pharmacists (N = 5), community pharmacists (N = 4), pharmacists working across settings (N = 5) and one working in another primary care setting. Participants were recruited through professional networks, social media and snowballing. Results Primary care pharmacists and community pharmacists were utilising clinical and physical examination skills in their practice. Some community pharmacists were operating locally-commissioned services for low acuity conditions. Incorporating such examinations into practice enabled pharmacists to look at the patient holistically and enhanced pharmacist/patient relationships. Barriers to practise included lack of timely sharing of patient data and perceived reluctance on the part of some pharmacists for advanced practice. Conclusion With growing opportunities to provide patient-focussed care, it remains to be seen whether pharmacists, both in Great Britain and elsewhere, are able to overcome some of the organisational, structural and cultural barriers to advanced practice that currently exist in community pharmacy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Dispensing remains a key component of the pharmacy undergraduate curriculum, teaching skills in the individualized preparation of medicines. In hospitals, pharmacists compound medicines to improve access for patients who would otherwise not have the medicine in the suitable formulation. Current trends suggest that the dispensing curriculum needs to be improved to include topics that will equip students with skills and competences in hospital compounding. The objective of this review was to describe compounding needs and practices in hospitals in Nigeria with a view to curriculum development. Four studies were retrieved that show that compounding was for magistral preparations or products prepared from other existing products. Most of the compounded medicines were oral liquids for use in pediatric patients. The majority of compounded medicines were in three therapeutic groups: 1) cardiovascular, 2) antimicrobials, and 3) vitamins. These were commonly prepared by crushing tablets or emptying capsules into compounding vehicles such as distilled water, vitamin C, or vitamin B-complex syrups. Being magistral, these are not included in the curriculum by default, as the curriculum focuses on officinal preparations. Expanded training to include a module incorporating protocols for the preparation and quality and stability testing for these compounded medicines advances the practice of dispensing and is urgently needed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

204,34807848,"Formulation, Physical Stability, and the Clinical Effectiveness of Extemporaneous Ivermectin Oral Solution.  Ivermectin is a gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-gated-Cl-channels modulator, which has been used orally in the treatment of numerous parasitic infections. The study target was to set up a stable, efficient 0.2% w/v ivermectin solution, which would be achieved from pure ivermectin powder as a source of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Several trial solutions were prepared. The most fitting solution, with respect to its organoleptic properties, was chosen for additional investigation, including the solution's physical stability. Two storage conditions, room temperature (25°C, 60% relative humidity) and accelerated stability chambers (40°C, 75% relative humidity) were subjected to guarantee the physical stability of the solution through the 3-month study period. Furthermore, other quality tests were assessed, (e.g., pH, assay, organoleptic properties, microbial contamination) for the same latter period. Quantification of ivermectin was validated utilizing a high-performance liquid chromatography analytical method. The adopted solution showed accepted organoleptic properties. The pH of the solutions was approximately 5 and remained unchanged during the stability study. The mean percent of remained ivermectin solution was close to 97% ± 0.2 at room temperature. Ivermectin solution was additionally tested for microbial contamination, and it was free from any microbial contamination (E. coli bacteria: Negative/mL, yeast and molds count: <10 cfu/mL and aerobic microbial count results in <10 cfu/mL). The adopted formula showed the best physical stability within at least the three months of storage at both room and accelerated conditions. Ivermectin solution was successfully prepared from its pure powder. This formula provides a stable, efficient oral solution for those who suffer from swallowing difficulties or patients in the intensive care unit who cannot receive the medication in a solid dosage form.

OBJECTIVES This retrospective study examined how a pharmacist-involved education program in a multidisciplinary team (PEMT) for oral mucositis (OM) affected head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS Total samples data of 53 patients during the stipulated timeframe were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records from February 2017 to January 2019. We compared the presence/absence of OM (OM: yes/no) between patients with and without PEMT (PEMT: yes/no) as the primary endpoint and OM severity as the secondary endpoint. The following information was surveyed: age, gender, weight loss, steroid or immunosuppressant use, hematological values (albumin, white blood cell count, blood platelets, and neutrophils), cancer grade, primary cancer site, type and use of mouthwash and moisturizer, opioid use (yes/no, days until the start of opioid use, and dose, switch to tape), and length of hospital day (LOD). The two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test for qualitative data and the Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative data, and a significance level of p<0.05 was set. RESULTS The group managed by PEMT had significantly lower weight loss and a significantly lower incidence of local anesthetic and opioid use and switch to tape compared with the group not managed by PEMT (p<0.05). The two groups showed no significant difference in OM (yes/no) or OM severity. The PEMT group had significantly shorter LOD at 57 (53-64) days compared with the non-PEMT group at 63.5 (57-68) days (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that PEMT did not improve OM (yes/no) or OM severity in HNC patients undergoing CCRT. However, the PEMT group had a lower incidence of grades 3 and 4 OM than the non-PEMT group, although not significantly. In addition, PEMT contributed to oral pain relief and the lowering of the risk for OM by reduction in weight loss.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,Oncology,Oncology,,,,,Other,Not stated in the abstract.
206,34807982,"Identifying Practices to Promote Inpatient Adolescent and Influenza Vaccine Delivery. OBJECTIVES Many hospitalized children are underimmunized. We assessed the association between hospital immunization practices and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal, human papillomavirus (HPV), and influenza vaccine delivery. METHODS An electronic survey regarding hospital vaccine delivery practices was distributed via the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings networks to PHIS hospitals. Number of vaccines delivered and total discharges in 2018 were obtained from the PHIS database to determine hospital vaccine delivery rates; patients 11 to 18 years old (adolescent vaccines) and 6 months to 18 years old (influenza vaccine) were included. Vaccine delivery rates were risk adjusted by using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling and compared with survey responses to determine associations between the number or presence of specific practices and vaccine delivery. Adjusted HPV and meningococcal vaccine delivery rates could not be calculated because of low delivery. RESULTS Twenty-nine hospitals completed a survey (57%). 152 499 and 423 046 patient encounters were included for the adolescent and influenza vaccines, respectively. Unadjusted inpatient vaccine delivery rates varied. After adjustment, the number of practices was associated only with influenza vaccine delivery (P = .02). Visual prompts (P = .02), nurse or pharmacist ordering (P = .003), and quality improvement projects (P = .048) were associated with increased influenza vaccine delivery; nurse or pharmacist ordering had the greatest impact. No practices were associated with Tdap vaccine delivery. CONCLUSIONS The number and presence of specific hospital practices may impact influenza vaccine delivery.

OBJECTIVE To describe geographic and sociodemographic variations in operating hours and availability of medications commonly prescribed by pediatric urologists at Washington State retail pharmacies. METHODS We identified all retail pharmacies in the state. We stratified counties by population density and household income (HI) and compared differences in pharmacy operating hours and availability of 10 commonly prescribed medications. RESULTS 1057/1058 pharmacies were contacted. All pharmacies had liquid formulations of oxycodone, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in stock. Liquid formulations of ciprofloxacin (10%) and oxybutynin (14.3%) were uncommonly stocked, while 92.5% of pharmacies stocked nitrofurantoin suspension and 80.9% nitrofurantoin capsules. Statewide, 108 (10.2%) of pharmacies were closed on Saturdays and 297 (28.1%) closed on Sunday. More high (HPDC) than low population density (LPDC) (62.5% vs 0%, p<0.001) and high-HI than low-HI counties (62.5% vs. 0%, p=0.30) had 24-hour pharmacies. A larger proportion of pharmacies were open 7-days in HPDC than LPDC (75.6% vs 56.2%, p<0.0001) and in high-HI than low-HI counties (100% vs. 62.5%, p=0.30). The likelihood of a pharmacy being open 7 days/week was significantly higher in HPDC (versus LPDC; OR=13.2, 95% CI: 4.39-39.7) and high-HI (versus low-HI; OR=4.98, 95% CI: 2.58-9.60) counties. CONCLUSIONS Most pharmacies in Washington State carry medications commonly prescribed by pediatric urologists. However, retail pharmacy operating hours are widely variable and create geographic and temporal barriers in rural and poor areas that may limit the timely administration of prescription medication.

209,34810136,"Pharmacy practice in emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons from Australia.  The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the pharmacy practice and initiatives taken by the Australian federal government to ensure the continued supply of essential medicines under the conditions of an emergency response plan for COVID-19. During the pandemic, Australian pharmacists have been working collaboratively with multidisciplinary teams at the frontline to manage the equitable and safe supply of medicines despite the unprecedented situation. Although these presented problems for small pharmacies, social distancing policies were implemented widely to maintain personal and environmental hygiene and reduce the number of face-to-face patient visits. In collaboration with various pharmaceutical stakeholders, the Australian government responded rapidly to ensure equitable and sufficient supply with continued access to therapeutic goods during the pandemic. Additionally, vital policies and practices have been implemented, including supplying regular medicines at government-subsidized prices, a maximum one-month supply of some prescription medicines and purchase limits on over-the-counter medicines (one unit per purchase), medication management reviews through telehealth, electronic and digital prescribing, home delivery of medicines to vulnerable people and those in home isolation and the provision of serious shortage medicine substitution rights to pharmacists. Pharmacists were encouraged to communicate and collaborate with other local pharmacies to ensure that essential pharmacy services met community needs (e.g., opening hours). However, there has been a shortage of some medicines due to supply chain disruption and increased demand due to the pandemic. Higher demand for flu vaccinations, increased work pressure in pharmacies, and severe frustration and anxiety in pharmacy customers were also reported. Vigilance is required to monitor foreseeable shortages of therapeutics goods, particularly in regional pharmacies.

210,34811600,"Determination of potential drug-drug interactions in prescription orders dispensed in a community pharmacy setting using Micromedex® and Lexicomp®: a retrospective observational study.  Background Community pharmacists have a role in identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) when processing prescription orders and dispensing medications to patients. The harmful effects of DDIs can be prevented or minimized by using an electronic DDI checker to screen for potential DDIs (pDDIs). However, different DDI checkers have variable rates of detecting pDDIs. Aim To estimate the prevalence of pDDIs in prescriptions dispensed in a community pharmacy setting using two electronic DDI databases and to evaluate the association between the pDDIs and contributory factors. Method Eligible prescription orders dispensed by a community pharmacy chain in Qatar from January to July 2020 were included in this retrospective observational study. For each prescription, Micromedex® and Lexicomp® were simultaneously used to identify pDDIs, and the interactions categorized based on severity and risk rating. Results Seven hundred-twenty prescriptions met the inclusion criteria, of which Micromedex® and Lexicomp® respectively identified 125 prescriptions (17.4%) and 230 prescriptions (31.9%) as having at least one pDDI. Moderate strength of agreement was found between Lexicomp® and Micromedex® in identifying pDDIs (Cohen's Kappa = 0.546). Micromedex® classified 61.6% of DDIs as major severity, while Lexicomp® classified 30.8% as major severity. The number of concurrent medications per prescription was significantly and positively associated with pDDI. Conclusion This study demonstrates a high prevalence of pDDIs among prescriptions dispensed in a community pharmacy setting. It is advisable that community pharmacists in Qatar, who typically do not have access to computerized patient profiles, use these DDI checkers to ensure all pDDIs are communicated to respective prescribers for appropriate action.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

213,34814820,"Clinical Pharmacist's Contribution to Medication Reconciliation in Outpatient Specialty Clinics in Iran. BACKGROUND The majority of research in medication reconciliation has focused on the inpatient settings, and little is known about the outpatient settings, particularly in developing countries. As such, we conducted this study to evaluate direct clinical pharmacist involvement in medication reconciliation in outpatient specialty clinics in Iran. METHODS This prospective interventional study was conducted from September 2019 to February 2020 in a University-affiliated clinic in Iran. For 196 patients over 18 years of age who were scheduled for an appointment with a physician, medication reconciliation intervention was carried out by a clinical pharmacist. The number and type of unintentional discrepancies, their potential harm to the patients, their correlation with the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, and the number of accepted recommendations upon the unintentional discrepancies by the clinicians were assessed and recorded. Additionally, patients' understanding of any change made to their current medication regimen was also assessed. The association between the unintentional discrepancies with patients' characteristics was also assessed. RESULTS Totally, 57.14% of patients had at least one or more unintentional medication discrepancies, with an overall rate of 1.51 (±0.62) per patient. This is while the patient understanding of their medication changes was inadequate in a significant proportion of the study patients (62.2%). Patients with older ages, lower educational levels, and a higher number of medications and comorvidities were at a higher risk of having unintentional discrepancies. The most common type of unintentional discrepancy was the omission of a drug, and almost half of the reconciliation errors might have had the potential to cause moderate or severe harm to the patient. From 145 recommendations suggested by the clinical pharmacist upon unintentional discrepancies, 131 cases (90.34%) were accepted and implemented by the clinicians. CONCLUSION These findings further support the need for conducting medication reconciliation in outpatient settings to identify discrepancies and enhance the safety of patient medication use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
214,34814848,"Integrating medication risk management interventions into regular automated dose dispensing service of older home care clients - a systems approach. BACKGROUND Automated dose dispensing (ADD) services have been implemented in many health care systems internationally. However, the ADD service itself is a logistic process that requires integration with medication risk management interventions to ensure safe and appropriate medication use. National policies and regulations guiding ADD in Finland have recommended medication reconciliation, review, and follow-up for suitable risk management interventions. This implementation study aimed to develop a medication management process integrating these recommended risk management interventions into a regular ADD service for older home care clients. METHODS This study applied an action research method and was carried out in a home care setting, part of primary care in the City of Lahti, Finland. The systems-approach to risk management was applied as a theoretical framework. RESULTS The outcome of the systems-based development process was a comprehensive medication management procedure. The medication risk management interventions of medication reconciliation, review and follow-up were integrated into the medication management process while implementing the ADD service. The tasks and responsibilities of each health care professional involved in the care team became more explicitly defined, and available resources were utilized more effectively. In particular, the hospital pharmacists became members of the care team where collaboration between physicians, pharmacists, and nurses shifted from parallel working towards close collaboration. More efforts are needed to integrate community pharmacists into the care team. CONCLUSION The transition to the ADD service allows implementation of the effective medication risk management interventions within regular home care practice. These systemic defenses should be considered when national ADD guidelines are implemented locally. The same applies to situations in which public home care organizations responsible for services e.g., municipalities, purchase ADD services from private service providers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were collected on committee membership, leadership, functions, and charges. New questions explored ties to assessment and Standards 2016. Analysis included descriptive statistics and comparisons to the 2011 survey results.Results Response rate was 80%; one partial response was excluded from analysis. Most (93%) schools and colleges rely on a curriculum committee to provide curriculum oversight. Faculty and students remain the most frequent types of members but there has been an increase in the number of committees with members from other areas including experiential programs, staff, directors, librarians, and pharmacy residents. Committee charges have increased beyond the traditional curriculum planning, mapping, and review to include newer tasks (eg, EPAs, IPEs, PPCP, co-curriculum, certificates).

Thus, the objectives of this study were to: establish validity evidence of the KCES-R (Kiersma-Chen Empathy Scale-Revised), compare student self-perceptions and standardized patient (SP) perceptions of student empathy using a parallel patient scale (KCES-PV), and evaluate student reflections on the encounter.Methods. Student pharmacists completed an assessment of their self-perceptions of empathy (KCES-R) pre-/post-patient encounter. SPs completed the KCES-PV regarding student pharmacist empathy immediately post-encounter. Student pharmacists also watched their encounter videos and completed a self-reflection on their use of empathy. Descriptive statistics, Spearman's rank-order correlations, exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test were computed. Reflections were explored using thematic analysis.Results. The KCES-R contains 2 factors with high internal consistency and shows the ability to detect changes in empathy. Student pharmacist self-perceptions of empathy ability appeared higher than the SP evaluation. Student pharmacists had a stronger belief in the importance of expressing empathy during patient encounters and indicated a need for further development.Conclusion. This study provides validity evidence for the use of the KCES-R and presents a parallel scale that may be used by SPs. Validated parallel scales along with reflective practice could be a potential avenue to grow self-awareness and empathy by allowing students to receive feedback and then reflect on their perceived vs actual demonstration of the skill.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

220,34815273,"Survey of workflow and cost implications of decommissioning regarding the Falsified Medicines Directive in Hungarian hospital pharmacies. OBJECTIVES, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS In July 2011, the EU adopted the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) primarily aiming to prevent the infiltration of falsified medicines into the legitimate supply chain. Our aim was to measure the cost elements of FMD implementation and operation using an internationally adaptable tool among Hungarian hospital pharmacies. DESIGN A 41-item questionnaire was developed to evaluate the implementation process and associated cost consequences leading up to February 2019, and the stabilisation period. RESULTS Our representative data are supported by the high response rate, as 44.8% of the Hungarian hospital pharmacies have completed the survey. Human resource requirements related to decommissioning activities were measured as working hours and were expressed in full time equivalent (FTE). We have found an increased workload with extra 0.25 pharmacist and 0.75 technician FTE/institution at the end of the stabilisation period. The entire infrastructural and IT implementation costs were determined as €2173, on average (SD: €3366) and the median was €1506 (range: €0-€20 723). The total IT investment cost per institution was valued at €1410 (SD: €335). We identified a positive correlation (R=0.663) in consideration of the costs, the number of beds and the number of hospital locations with a multivariate linear regression model. At the time of our survey, 76.7% of the respondents experienced drug shortages, 58.1% reported suspected increase in drug costs regarding serialised medications, and 53.5% noticed an increase in packaging size. CONCLUSIONS Notably, our research is the first complex study depicting FMD cost implications in the hospital pharmacy sector in Central Europe, indicating decommissioning significantly impacted workflow referencing human resources and IT.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
221,34815972,"Assessment of Community Pharmacist's Practice and Patient Counselling Toward Acute Diarrhea Treatment in Khartoum Locality: A Simulated Patient Study. Background Acute diarrhea is one of the most common health problems globally as a minor ailment, it is widely managed by community pharmacists (CPs). Professional patient counseling provided in community pharmacies is essential to decide about acute diarrhea and avoid treatment failure properly. Objective To assess CPs' history-taking practice, medication dispensing, and patient counseling in response to acute diarrhea in adults. Methods A cross-sectional, covert simulated patient (SP) study was conducted in 235 community pharmacies in the Khartoum locality. Two scenarios were used, one scenario assesses afterwards compliance to treatment guidelines and patient counseling, and second scenario determines afterwards if pharmacists referred patients to medical consultation. Six final-year pharmacy students were involved as SPs. All encounters were audio-recorded by SP. Then the investigator filled the checklist that was intended to evaluate the overall practice of pharmacists. Results As planned, 235 pharmacies were visited twice, resulting in a total of 470 visits (visit completion rate: 100%). In history taking, the most asked questions were the patient's age (89.8% for scenario 1 and 88.5% for scenario 2). Followed by the presence of blood in the stool (25.5% for scenario 1 and 28.1% for scenario 2). In scenario 1, loperamide was the most dispensed medication (81.3%), while oral rehydration solution (ORS) was dispensed in 0.9% of the visits. In counseling, verbal and written instructions were provided in 47.7% of the visits. Duration of medications was mentioned in 3.8%, advice about fluid intake was offered in 7.2% of the visits. In scenario 2, 17% of the pharmacists managed patient history well to refer patients to medical consultation, while 42.6% recommended referral after sufficient information was provided by the SP. Conclusion CPs' practice in counseling toward acute diarrhea was poor; referral to medical consultation was below expectation. The current CPs dispensing practices need improvement; thus, professional education should be encouraged.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting, inherited, multi-organ disease which affects many systems of the body. Until recently, treatments were only able to ameliorate symptoms, but the introduction of precision medications which modulate the underlying defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene has changed this. Notably improvements in nutrition and lung function, reduced use of antibiotics and reduced occupation rates for hospital beds have been seen. This article summarises the discussion of a group of healthcare professionals from different specialties and an expert patient, representing their personal views and experience of treating patients who are using CFTR modulators.

223,34817667,"Adverse drug events during transitions of care : Randomized clinical trial of medication reconciliation at hospital admission. BACKGROUND During transitions of care, patient's medications are prone to medication errors. This study evaluated the impact of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation at hospital admission on unintentional medication discrepancies and adverse drug events. METHODS A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 120 adult medical patients hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in Slovenia. In the intervention group, a pharmacist-led medication reconciliation was performed on admission, while the control group received usual care. Patient's drug treatment before admission was compared with their admission and inpatient treatment to identify discrepancies. The intention of discrepancies and related adverse drug events were assessed as a consensus of an expert panel. RESULTS Included patients were elderly (median 72 years) and treated with polypharmacy (median 7 medications). Upon admission, discrepancies and unintentional discrepancies, representing a medication error, were identified in 61.2% (825/1347) and 18.3% (247/1347) of medications, respectively. In the intervention group, only 29.1% (37/127) of unintentional discrepancies were reported to the physicians in person. The majority of admission discrepancies (88%) persisted through hospitalization. Unintentional discrepancies resulted in 51 adverse drug events even during hospitalization. There were no differences between the intervention and control group in the occurrence of unintentional discrepancies (p = 0.481) or adverse drug events (p = 0.801). CONCLUSIONS Medication reconciliation at hospital admission failed to reduce unintentional discrepancies and adverse drug events, possibly due to its poor integration into clinical practice. Discrepancies resulted in patient harm even during the short period of hospitalization, which warrants the implementation of medication reconciliation at hospital admission.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,Geriatric,Geriatric,,,Inpatient,Inpatient,,
224,34817853,"Pharmacist-led transitions of care between hospitals, primary care clinics, and community pharmacies. BACKGROUND Pharmacist-led transitions of care (TOC) interventions have been described as some of the most promising interventions to reduce medication-related harm (MRH) in older adults. This study analyzed the feasibility of pharmacist-led TOC interventions between hospitals, multidisciplinary primary care clinics (PCC), and community pharmacies. METHODS Adults aged 65 years and older at risk of MRH in three regions of Quebec, Canada, with contrasting contexts of care based on university affiliation were recruited in this multicenter, single arm, and prospective intervention cohort. The hospital pharmacist developed the pharmaceutical care plan in collaboration with the hospital physician and transferred this plan with the hospitalization summary, at hospital discharge, to the PCC family physician and to the community and PCC pharmacists. A consultation with the community pharmacist was scheduled within seven days of hospital discharge and with the PCC pharmacist when appropriate. Feasibility outcomes included the time to complete the interventions and their location. RESULTS The 123 eligible patients had a mean age of 78.5 years, and 63.4% were females. The most frequent inclusion criterion was 10 medications or more, including one high-risk medication for 90 patients (73%). Recruitment in one region was stopped after three months due to unsuccessful recruitment of key PCC. The hospital pharmacist interventions took a median of 165 min. The first consultations of the PCC and community pharmacists took a median of 15 and 50 min. Among the 96 patients with a post-discharge pharmacist follow-up, 23 (24.0%) had a consultation with a PCC pharmacist, with 65.2% of the consultations conducted at the PCC. The community pharmacists conducted a consultation with 88 patients (93%), with more than 70% of consultations conducted by phone. CONCLUSION Our study showed the feasibility of pharmacist-led TOC interventions between hospitals, PCC, and community pharmacies and detailed the novel role that PCC pharmacists played in optimizing TOC interventions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
225,34818084,"Evaluation of the impact of a clinical pharmacist on a specialty neurology clinic's adherence to recommended laboratory test monitoring.  BACKGROUND: Pharmacists can have a significant effect on the specialty ambulatory care setting. Specialty medications are potentially high risk and may require frequent laboratory test monitoring to assess for therapy-associated adverse effects. Pharmacists may work under collaborative drug therapy management agreements that allow for the ordering and assessment of recommended laboratory tests in order to optimize safe and effective medication use. The impact of pharmacists on clinic adherence to recommended laboratory test monitoring has yet to be described in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of a specialty clinical pharmacist on neurology clinic adherence to manufacturer-recommended laboratory test monitoring. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review at a single academic medical center for the period between July 1, 2014, and April 30, 2020, comparing laboratory test monitoring adherence before (prepharmacist) and after (post-pharmacist) incorporation of a pharmacist into a neurology clinic. Patients were included if they lived in the Tri-County Area of Charleston, South Carolina, and received a prescription for dalfampridine, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, or cannabidiol that was prescribed by a neurology clinic provider at the Medical University of South Carolina. Chart review was conducted to assess clinic adherence with manufacturer-recommended laboratory test monitoring. Laboratory test monitoring was considered adherent if obtained within 6 months before or on the date of prescription order. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables, and adherence rates were compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: For dalfampridine, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide, there were 123 patients and 78 patients in the pre- and post-pharmacist groups, respectively. There were 51 patients in the cannabidiol group. Clinic adherence to laboratory test monitoring improved in the post-pharmacist group for every monitoring point, with statistically significant improvement in ""hepatic function tests every 6-9 months"" (P = 0.005), ""CBC every 6-9 months"" (P = 0.01), and ""VZV IgG titer at baseline"" (P = 0.005) for patients taking fingolimod.

226,34818090,"The cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-physician collaborative care models vs usual care on time in target systolic blood pressure range in patients with hypertension: a payer perspective.  BACKGROUND: Hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting nearly half of all adults (43%). Studies have shown that pharmacist-physician collaborative care models (PPCCMs) for hypertension management significantly improve blood pressure (BP) control rates and provide consistent control of BP. Time in target range (TTR) for systolic BP is a novel measure of BP control consistency that is independently associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. There is no evidence that observed improvement in TTR for systolic BP with a PPCCM is cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a PPCCM with usual care for the management of hypertension from the payer perspective. METHODS: We used a decision analytic model with a 3-year time horizon based on published literature and publicly available data. The population consisted of adult patients who had a previous diagnosis of high BP (defined as office-based BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) or were receiving antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness data were drawn from 2 published studies evaluating the effect of PPCCMs (vs usual care) on TTR for systolic BP and the impact of TTR for systolic BP on 4 cardiovascular outcomes (nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, heart failure [HF], and cardiovascular disease [CVD] death). The model incorporated direct medical costs, including both programmatic costs (ie, direct costs for provider time) and downstream health care utilization associated with acute cardiovascular events. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses examined model robustness. RESULTS: In base-case analyses, PPCCM hypertension management was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures (difference: -$162.86) and lower total program costs (difference: -$108.00) when compared with usual care. PPCCM was associated with lower downstream medical expenditures across all parameter ranges tested in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. For every 10,000 hypertension patients managed with PPCCM vs usual care over a 3-year time horizon, approximately 27 CVD deaths, 29 strokes, 21 nonfatal MIs, and 12 incident HF diagnoses are expected to be averted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPCCM compared to usual care on TTR for systolic BP in adults with hypertension. PPCCM was less costly to administer and resulted in downstream health care savings and fewer acute cardiovascular events relative to usual care. Although further research is needed to evaluate the long-term costs and outcomes of PPCCM, payer coverage of PPCCM services may prevent future health care costs and improve patient cardiovascular outcomes.

227,34819057,"Spatial determinants of excess all-cause mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. BACKGROUND The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France was associated with high excess mortality, and anecdotal evidence pointed to differing excess mortality patterns depending on social and environmental determinants. In this study we aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of excess mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and relate it at the subnational level to contextual determinants from various dimensions (socioeconomic, population density, overall health status, healthcare access etc.). We also explored whether the determinants identified at the national level varied depending on geographical location. METHODS We used available national data on deaths in France to calculate excess mortality by department for three age groups: 0-49, 50-74 and > 74 yrs. between March 1st and April 27th, 2020. We selected 15 variables at the department level that represent four dimensions that may be related to overall mortality at the ecological level, two representing population-level vulnerabilities (morbidity, social deprivation) and two representing environmental-level vulnerabilities (primary healthcare supply, urbanization). We modelled excess mortality by age group for our contextual variables at the department level. We conducted both a global (i.e., country-wide) analysis and a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model to account for the spatial variations in excess mortality. RESULTS In both age groups, excess all-cause mortality was significantly higher in departments where urbanization was higher (50-74 yrs.: β = 15.33, p < 0.001; > 74 yrs.: β = 18.24, p < 0.001) and the supply of primary healthcare providers lower (50-74 yrs.: β = - 8.10, p < 0.001; > 74 yrs.: β = - 8.27, p < 0.001). In the 50-74 yrs. age group, excess mortality was negatively associated with the supply of pharmacists (β = - 3.70, p < 0.02) and positively associated with work-related mobility (β = 4.62, p < 0.003); in the > 74 yrs. age group our measures of deprivation (β = 15.46, p < 0.05) and morbidity (β = 0.79, p < 0.008) were associated with excess mortality. Associations between excess mortality and contextual variables varied significantly across departments for both age groups. CONCLUSIONS Public health strategies aiming at mitigating the effects of future epidemics should consider all dimensions involved to develop efficient and locally tailored policies within the context of an evolving, socially and spatially complex situation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Collaboration is the way to deliver the desired health outcome for the patients or service users in the healthcare. Inter-professional collaboration can improve medication safety, patient outcome and minimize healthcare costs. This study aimed to explore the degree of collaboration and factors influencing collaboration between physicians and pharmacists within the public hospitals of Jigjiga town, Somali National Regional State, Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS A cross-sectional study qualitative was conducted among 149 participants in the two governmental hospitals of the Jigjiga town with a response rate of 79.87%. The collaborative working relationship model and the physician-pharmacist collaborative instrument with three main exchange domains (trustworthiness, role specification, and relationship initiation) and collaborative care items were used. An independent sample t-test was used to compute the differences of the mean scores of physician-pharmacist collaborative instrument domains and collaborative care. Separate multiple regression was employed to assess factors influencing collaborative care for pharmacists and physicians. RESULTS This study showed that pharmacists reported higher mean of collaborative care (10.66 ± 4.75) than physicians (9.17 ± 3.92). The multiple regression indicated that area of practice influence both professionals' collaborative practice. A significant association between collaborative care and the two PPCI domains (trustworthiness and relationship initiation for the physicians; role specification and relationship initiation for pharmacists) was established. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that the collaboration between the physicians and pharmacists was sub-optimal and the exchange variables had a significant influence on their collaboration.

229,34819206,"COVID-19 Knowledge and Pandemic-Associated Distress among the Hospital Pharmacist Workforce in China. BACKGROUND The unprecedented disruption brought about by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had produced tremendous influence on the practice of pharmacy. Sufficient knowledge of pharmacists was needed to deal with the epidemic situation, however, outbreak also aggravated psychological distress among healthcare professionals. Therefore, this study aimed to determine knowledge about the pandemic and related factors, prevalence and factors associated with psychological distress among hospital pharmacists of Xinjiang Province, China. METHODS An anonymous online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted via WeChat, a popular social media platform in China, during the COVID-19 outbreak from 23th to 27th February 2020. The survey questionnaire consisted of 4 parts including informed consent section, demographic section, knowledge about COVID-19 and assessment of overall mental health through World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). A score of 8 or above on SRQ-20 was used as cut-off to classify the participant as in psychological distress. SRQ-20 score and related knowledge score were used as dependent variables, demographic characteristics (such as gender, age, monthly income, etc) were used as independent variables, and univariate binary logistic regression was used to screen out the variables with p<0.05. Then, the filtered variables were used as independent variables, multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze associations with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 and psychological distress. RESULTS A total of 365 pharmacists participated in the survey, fewer than half (35.1%, n=128) of pharmacists attained a score of 6 or greater (out of 10) in overall disease knowledge, and most were able to select effective disinfectants and isolation or discharge criteria. In multivariable model, age ages 31-40(OR=3.25, p<0.05), ages 41-50(OR=2.96, p<0.05) vs >50 (referent); primary place of practice in hospitals: drug supply (OR=4.00, p<0.01), inpatient pharmacy(OR=2.06, p<0.01), clinical pharmacy (OR=2.17, p<0.05) vs outpatient pharmacy (referent); monthly income Renminbi (RMB, China's legal currency) 5000-10000 (OR=1.77, p<0.05) vs <5000 (referent); contact with COVID-2019 patients or suspected cases (OR=2.27, p<0.01); access to COVID-19 knowledge remote work+ on-site work(OR=6.07, p<0.05), single on-site work (OR=6.90, p<0.01) vs remote work (referent) were related to better knowledge of COVID-19. Research found that 18.4% of pharmacists surveyed met the SRQ-20 threshold for distress. Self-reported history of mental illness (OR=3.56, p<0.05) and working and living in hospital vs delay in work resumption (OR=2.87, p<0.01) were found to be risk factors of psychological distress. CONCLUSION Further training of COVID-19 knowledge was required for pharmacists. As specific pharmacist groups were prone to psychological distress, it was important for individual hospitals and government to consider and identify pharmacists' needs and take steps to meet their needs with regard to pandemic and other work-related distress.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN In this qualitative study, general inductive method was used and semi-structured exploratory interviews conducted. SETTING Stakeholders from a broad range of academic and healthcare practitioners in Qatar. PARTICIPANTS Exploratory, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 stakeholders throughout Qatar. The inclusion criteria include (a) participants working or involved in the Qatar's healthcare system, (b) participants having experience or working knowledge of medicine policy documents, different facets of it, use of medicines and access to medicines, (c) as well as participants well versed in the English language. It was intended to cover stakeholders from a broad range of healthcare and policy institutions in Qatar. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES All participants were involved in semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews, which were then transcribed verbatim, coded into NVivo V.12 and followed by thematic analysis to identify the common themes. Perceptions, experiences and opinions regarding Qatar's medicines policy issues were recorded. RESULTS This study found challenges related to the availability of pharmaceuticals in Qatar, including medicines registration process. There is no comprehensive national medicines policy in Qatar, however, there are a number of rules, regulations, policies and procedures in place. The community pharmacy services provided are mostly 'traditional' with less emphasis on pharmacists' extended roles and/or cognitive services. The study identifies several areas for improvement including extending the role of the pharmacist, improve the prescribing of antibiotics, medicines compliance and counselling for consumers, pharmacovigilance, implementation of generic medicines policies, as well as the need for a national health record database. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that in the last 20 years, Qatar has moved towards advancing healthcare; however, there are gaps and opportunities. The strategies need to be developed to resolve access to medicines issues, the priority being medicines registration, import and so on.

Purpose Suboptimal adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a widely recognized issue compromising the disease control and survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A recently published review by Heiney et al reported inconclusive findings on the effects of a broad range of adherence enhancing interventions. The current systematic review aimed to identify studies that evaluated adherence-enhancing interventions implemented by healthcare professionals and determine their effect on CML patients' medication adherence and clinical outcomes. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in 5 databases for articles published between 2002 and 2021. Studies that compared adherence enhancing interventions implemented by healthcare professionals with a comparison group were included. Relevant data on study characteristics were extracted. Medication adherence and clinical outcomes between intervention and control arms were compared. Results Nine studies were included in two randomised controlled trials, four cohort studies, and three before-and-after comparison studies. All the included studies incorporated complex interventions, including intensive education or consultation with pharmacists, nurses or multidisciplinary team, in combination with one or more other strategies such as structured follow-up, written materials or video, psychotherapy, medication reminder or treatment diary, with the overall goal of monitoring and improving TKI adherence. Most (7 out of 9) studies demonstrated significantly better adherence to TKIs in the intervention group than the comparison group. The relative proportion of participants who adhered to TKIs ranged from 1.22 to 2.42. The improvement in the rate of TKI doses taken/received ranged from 1.5% to 7.1%. Only one study showed a significant association between intervention and clinical outcomes, with a 22.6% higher major molecular response rate and improvement in 6 out of 20 subscales of health-related quality-of-life.

233,34819786,"Development and evaluation of clinical reasoning using 'think aloud' approach in pharmacy undergraduates - A mixed-methods study. Introduction Given the widespread use of clinical reasoning (CR) in the healthcare practice, it is essential to inculcate the CR practice in undergraduate pharmacy education which can not only facilitate their clinical education and clinical rotations but can also help them become better clinical pharmacists. There is very limited CR employed in the pharmacy curriculum and practice in the Middle East countries. This study aimed to develop and evaluate CR practice in pharmacy undergraduates in one college of pharmacy in Saudi Arabia. Methods We employed a mixed-methods methodology that included two phases. In Phase I, students were introduced to CR practice ('think aloud' method) and given geriatric clinical cases which they used in two sessions together with a tutor. This was followed by the writing of SOAP notes using the tutor feedback and completion of a survey that included a self-reflection about their experience of using the CR method. Phase II included face-to-face semi-structured interviews involving selected students that were recruited via convenience sampling to further explore the issues identified in Phase I of the study. Results Of the 155 students who completed the survey (response rate 94%), the majority of them agreed that CR using the 'think aloud' method was useful in gathering (92%) and interpreting (95%) relevant patient information, identifying medication-related problems (95%), exploring therapeutic options for the problem(s) (93%) and formulating a treatment plan for the patient (90%). Qualitative data analysis of the 12 interviews was consistent with these findings. Furthermore, it provided an insight into the challenges faced by the students in applying this CR method. Conclusions Students found the practice of CR using the 'think aloud' method helpful in working through given cases and taking clinical decisions.

234,34819794,"Evaluation and pharmacists perspective of repeat prescribing process in refill clinics. Introduction Repeat prescription refers to a re-prescribed medications list issued by a refill clinic, commonly for stable chronic illnesses. The issues regarding repeat prescriptions have garnered increasing important in recent years, as no general agreement about a standardized protocol exists between organizations. Due to the importance of pharmacists' involvement and intervention in the process of repeat prescription and the lack of local studies discussing this topic, the aim of this study was to assess pharmacists' perspectives toward the repeat prescription process and identify the issues related to repeat prescriptions in refill clinics at tertiary hospitals. Methodology A self-developed questionnaire was used to assess outpatient pharmacists' perspectives toward the repeat prescription process. This was followed by a comprehensive review of the electronic health records (EHR) of patients who requested repeat prescriptions to identify related issues. The study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital from September 2019 to January 2020. Results Based on the questionnaire, 34 pharmacists reported receiving less than 10 repeat prescriptions per week (82.35%); nevertheless, around 88.24% of pharmacists have faced issues with the repeat prescription process, and only 15.65% of the issues got resolved. Most of the pharmacists (88.24%) showed a proactive attitude toward modifying the work process to reduce issues. Further, the review of the patients' EHR identified 1766 prescriptions with related issues in 617 (14.02%) patients' profiles. Most of these issues were seen in the elderly (46.7%). The most common issue encountered was ""Patients came too early to request,"" which accounted for 986 (55.8%) of the total issues, followed by the issue of ""Refilling a restricted medication"" reported at 247 (14%). Only 11% of these issues were completely resolved by pharmacists. Conclusion The repeat prescription service might be associated with issues that lead to preventable adverse effects, especially among the elderly who are prone to such effects. Comprehensive reviews of patients' profiles are necessary to assess their needs and avoid such issues.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: The majority of the students were males (n = 223, 54%) with the mean age group 19-23 years, and 20 faculty members were interviewed with a mean duration of 15 min. Students have good knowledge about antibiotics use and the majority purchased antibiotics through prescription (n = 277, 66.9%) during the last month and strongly agreed to stop unnecessary household storage (n = 183 44.2%). Most of the students have heard the terminologies related to antimicrobial resistance through social media while unaware (n = 104, 25.1%) of a Pakistan national action plan against AMR (antimicrobial resistance). Overall, respondents have a somewhat good understanding of the ABR. Regular use of antibiotics without consultation of a physician can lead to ABR and some wrong answers were observed (162, 39.1%; p > 0.05). The majority of the students (n = 198, 47.8%) and teachers believe that the current pharmacy syllabus must be swiftly updated with the new subjects related to ABR and AMS (antimicrobial stewardship) in Pakistan. The UGPS have emphasized (n = 220, 53.1%; Median = 1, IQR = 2) establishing a link between academia and hospitals. The ABR issue has been highlighted by pharmacy faculty members, who have urged students to take practical efforts toward ABR and AMS knowledge. Conclusion: The UGPS knowledge related to ABR and AMS must be updated. Students at the undergraduate level must get training in order to encourage the sensible use of antibiotics. Courses on ABR and AMS should be included in present pharmacy curricula.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
237,34820311,"Assessment of pharmacists' perception toward continuing education.  Continuing education (CE) is a structured educational activity. Pharmacists must actively participate in CE and is an important part of developing the professional competency of pharmacists. This research focuses on measuring Saudi pharmacists' perception in CE, its impact on professional performance, and the barriers in CE. This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in 2020, using random sample of Saudi pharmacists working in all workplaces from different cities in Saudi Arabia using a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 15 questions that assess the perception of Saudi pharmacists toward CE and barriers that prevent them from CE. A total of 409 pharmacists participated in the study. Majority of pharmacists were working in government hospitals (48.4%) and have <2 years of practice experience (44.5%). More than 70% of respondents acknowledged that CE helps to increase their knowledge. The pharmacists mentioned that getting a certificate (23.37%) was the major reason for attending a CE event. The reasons that prevent respondents from attending live CE were cost and work responsibilities (23.59% and 24.57%, respectively). This study reported a subjective assessment of pharmacists' perception toward CE, their lifelong learning experience. Saudi pharmacists showed a great desire for CE because they believed that it greatly affects their professional performance.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
238,34820790,"Development of a Perioperative Medication-Related Clinical Decision Support Tool to Prevent Medication Errors: An Analysis of User Feedback. OBJECTIVES  Medication use in the perioperative setting presents many patient safety challenges that may be improved with electronic clinical decision support (CDS). The objective of this paper is to describe the development and analysis of user feedback for a robust, real-time medication-related CDS application designed to provide patient-specific dosing information and alerts to warn of medication errors in the operating room (OR). METHODS  We designed a novel perioperative medication-related CDS application in four phases: (1) identification of need, (2) alert algorithm development, (3) system design, and (4) user interface design. We conducted group and individual design feedback sessions with front-line clinician leaders and subject matter experts to gather feedback about user requirements for alert content and system usability. Participants were clinicians who provide anesthesia (attending anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, and house staff), OR pharmacists, and nurses. RESULTS  We performed two group and eight individual design feedback sessions, with a total of 35 participants. We identified 20 feedback themes, corresponding to 19 system changes. Key requirements for user acceptance were: Use hard stops only when necessary; provide as much information as feasible about the rationale behind alerts and patient/clinical context; and allow users to edit fields such as units, time, and baseline values (e.g., baseline blood pressure). CONCLUSION  We incorporated user-centered design principles to build a perioperative medication-related CDS application that uses real-time patient data to provide patient-specific dosing information and alerts. Emphasis on early user involvement to elicit user requirements, workflow considerations, and preferences during application development can result in time and money efficiencies and a safer and more usable system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Application of pharmacoeconomic data for decision making in medicines management is still nascent in most developing countries. Yet, escalating medication costs amidst rising budgetary constraints call for widespread application of economic evidence to maximize available healthcare resources. This study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of randomly-selected hospital pharmacists from secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities in Ogun State, Southwestern Nigeria, conducted between June and August 2019. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for primary data collection. Appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis at p < 0.05.

240,34822165,"Reducing medication errors for adults in hospital settings. BACKGROUND Medication errors are preventable events that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional or patient. Medication errors in hospitalised adults may cause harm, additional costs, and even death. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness of interventions to reduce medication errors in adults in hospital settings. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers on 16 January 2020.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies investigating interventions aimed at reducing medication errors in hospitalised adults, compared with usual care or other interventions. Outcome measures included adverse drug events (ADEs), potential ADEs, preventable ADEs, medication errors, mortality, morbidity, length of stay, quality of life and identified/solved discrepancies. We included any hospital setting, such as inpatient care units, outpatient care settings, and accident and emergency departments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. Where necessary, we extracted and reanalysed ITS study data using piecewise linear regression, corrected for autocorrelation and seasonality, where possible.  MAIN RESULTS: We included 65 studies: 51 RCTs and 14 ITS studies, involving 110,875 participants. About half of trials gave rise to 'some concerns' for risk of bias during the randomisation process and one-third lacked blinding of outcome assessment. Most ITS studies presented low risk of bias. Most studies came from high-income countries or high-resource settings. Medication reconciliation -the process of comparing a patient's medication orders to the medications that the patient has been taking- was the most common type of intervention studied. Electronic prescribing systems, barcoding for correct administering of medications, organisational changes, feedback on medication errors, education of professionals and improved medication dispensing systems were other interventions studied. Medication reconciliation Low-certainty evidence suggests that medication reconciliation (MR) versus no-MR may reduce medication errors (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.74; 3 studies; n=379). Compared to no-MR, MR probably reduces ADEs (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.80; 3 studies, n=1336 ; moderate-certainty evidence), but has little to no effect on length of stay (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95%CI -1.93 to 1.33 days; 3 studies, n=527) and quality of life (MD -1.51, 95%CI -10.04 to 7.02; 1 study, n=131).  Low-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to MR by other professionals, MR by pharmacists may reduce medication errors (OR 0.21, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.48; 8 studies, n=2648) and may increase ADEs (OR 1.34, 95%CI 0.73 to 2.44; 3 studies, n=2873). Compared to MR by other professionals, MR by pharmacists may have little to no effect on length of stay (MD -0.25, 95%CI -1.05 to 0.56; 6 studies, 3983). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that this intervention probably has little to no effect on mortality during hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.7; 2 studies, n=1000), and on readmissions at one month (RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.14; 2 studies, n=997); and low-certainty evidence suggests that the intervention may have little to no effect on quality of life (MD 0.00, 95%CI -14.09 to 14.09; 1 study, n=724).  Low-certainty evidence suggests that database-assisted MR conducted by pharmacists, versus unassisted MR conducted by pharmacists, may reduce potential ADEs (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.10 to 0.64; 2 studies, n=3326), and may have no effect on length of stay (MD 1.00, 95%CI -0.17 to 2.17; 1 study, n=311).  Low-certainty evidence suggests that MR performed by trained pharmacist technicians, versus pharmacists, may have little to no difference on length of stay (MD -0.30, 95%CI -2.12 to 1.52; 1 study, n=183). However, the CI is compatible with important beneficial and detrimental effects. Low-certainty evidence suggests that MR before admission may increase the identification of discrepancies compared with MR after admission (MD 1.27, 95%CI 0.46 to 2.08; 1 study, n=307). However, the CI is compatible with important beneficial and detrimental effects. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that multimodal interventions probably increase discrepancy resolutions compared to usual care (RR 2.14, 95%CI 1.81 to 2.53; 1 study, n=487). Computerised physician order entry (CPOE)/clinical decision support systems (CDSS) Moderate-certainty evidence shows that CPOE/CDSS probably reduce medication errors compared to paper-based systems (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.31 to 1.79; 2 studies, n=88).  Moderate-certainty evidence shows that, compared with standard CPOE/CDSS, improved CPOE/CDSS probably reduce medication errors (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.74 to 0.97; 2 studies, n=630). Low-certainty evidence suggests that prioritised alerts provided by CPOE/CDSS may prevent ADEs compared to non-prioritised (inconsequential) alerts (MD 1.98, 95%CI 1.65 to 2.31; 1 study; participant numbers unavailable). Barcode identification of participants/medications Low-certainty evidence suggests that barcoding may reduce medication errors (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.79; 2 studies, n=50,545). Reduced working hours Low-certainty evidence suggests that reduced working hours may reduce serious medication errors (RR 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.09; 1 study, n=634). However, the CI is compatible with important beneficial and detrimental effects. Feedback on prescribing errors Low-certainty evidence suggests that feedback on prescribing errors may reduce medication errors (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.67; 4 studies, n=384). Dispensing system Low-certainty evidence suggests that dispensing systems in surgical wards may reduce medication errors (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.79; 2 studies, n=1775). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to usual care, medication reconciliation, CPOE/CDSS, barcoding, feedback and dispensing systems in surgical wards may reduce medication errors and ADEs. However, the results are imprecise for some outcomes related to medication reconciliation and CPOE/CDSS. The evidence for other interventions is very uncertain.

241,34823191,"Impact of an emergency medicine pharmacist on door to needle alteplase time and patient outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. PURPOSE Time is a critical metric in the emergency department (ED) for acute ischemic stroke and thrombolytic therapy. National guidelines have emphasized tracking time from stroke onset to treatment and decreasing door to needle (DTN) time [1, 2]. Multidisciplinary teamwork is encouraged but, there is limited evidence demonstrating the value of the pharmacist on the stroke response team. The goal of this study is to compare DTN times in the ED with or without a pharmacist at bedside and examine the impact on subsequent patient outcomes. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Investigators identified patients who presented to the ED between August 2016 - May 2020 with signs of ischemic stroke and subsequently received intravenous alteplase. Patients were excluded if they refused alteplase or received alteplase off-campus before being transferred. Pharmacist documentation of clinical interventions was used to identify participation on the stroke response team. The primary outcome was median DTN time. Secondary outcomes included severity of deficits measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), hospital length of stay (LOS), 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and inpatient all-cause mortality. RESULTS Of the 164 patients included, 31 had an emergency medicine pharmacist at bedside (EMP group) and 133 did not (No EMP group). The median DTN time was significantly shorter at 35 min EMP [interquartile range (IQR) 29-44] vs 42 min No EMP [IQR 34-55]; p = 0.003. The number of cases achieving a DTN time of 30 min or less was significantly higher when a pharmacist was involved (35.5% vs.16.5%; p = 0.018) as well as the number of patients receiving alteplase within 45 min (80.7% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.015). NIHSS scores at discharge were lower in the EMP group (2 [IQR 0-5] vs. 4 [IQR 0-8.25]; p = 0.049). In patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed stroke, a difference was not observed in the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION Patients with an emergency medicine pharmacist as part of their stroke response team had significantly lower DTN times. A higher proportion of these cases met benchmark DTN times less than 45 min and 30 min. An emergency medicine pharmacist on a stroke response team has the potential to improve patient care.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,Emergency medicine,Emergency medicine,,,Inpatient,Inpatient,,
242,34823529,"Developing and piloting a self-assessment tool for medication review competence of practicing pharmacists based on nationally set competence criteria. BACKGROUND New competence requirements have emerged for pharmacists as a result of changing societal needs towards more patient-centred practices. Today, medication review competence can be considered as basic pharmaceutical competence. Medication review specific competence criteria and tools for self-assessing the competence are essential in building competences and a shared understanding of medication reviews as a collaborative practice. The aim of this study was to develop and pilot a self-assessment tool for medication review competence among practicing pharmacists in Finland. METHODS The development of the self-assessment tool was based on the national medication review competence criteria for pharmacists established in Finland in 2017 and piloting the tool among practicing pharmacists in a national online survey in October 2018. The pharmacists self-assessed their medication review competence with a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 for ""very poor/not at all"" to 5 for ""very good"". RESULTS The internal consistency of the self-assessment tool was high as the range of the competence areas' Cronbach's alpha was 0.953-0.973. The competence areas consisted of prescription review competence (20 items, Cronbach's alpha 0.953), additional statements for medication review competence (11 additional items, Cronbach's alpha 0.963) and medication review as a whole, including both the statements of prescription review and medication review competence (31 items, Cronbach's alpha 0.973). Competence items closely related to routine dispensing were most commonly self-estimated to be mastered by the practicing pharmacists who responded (n = 344), while the more clinical and patient-centred competence items had the lowest self-estimates. This indicates that the self-assessment tool works logically and differentiates pharmacists according to competence. The self-assessed medication review competence was at a very good or good level among more than half (55%) of the respondents (n = 344). CONCLUSION A self-assessment tool for medication review competence was developed and validated. The piloted self-assessment tool can be used for regular evaluation of practicing pharmacists' medication review competence which is becoming an increasingly important basis for their contribution to patient care and society.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
243,34824109,"Integrating the clinical pharmacist into the emergency department interdisciplinary team: a study protocol for a multicentre trial applying a non-randomised stepped-wedge study design. INTRODUCTION The 'emergency department (ED) pharmacist' is an integrated part of the ED interdisciplinary team in many countries, which have shown to improve medication safety and reduce costs related to hospitalisations. In Norway, few EDs are equipped with ED pharmacists, and research describing effects on patients has not been conducted. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of introducing clinical pharmacists to the interdisciplinary ED team. In this multicentre study, the intervention will be pragmatically implemented in the regular operation of three EDs in Northern Norway; Tromsø, Bodø and Harstad. Clinical pharmacists will work as an integrated part of the ED team, providing pharmaceutical care services such as medication reconciliation, review and/or counselling. The primary endpoint is 'time in hospital during 30 days after admission to the ED', combining (1) time in ED, (2) time in hospital (if hospitalised) and (3) time in ED and/or hospital if re-hospitalised during 30 days after admission. Secondary endpoints include time to rehospitalisation, length of stay in ED and hospital and rehospitalisation and mortality rates. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will apply a non-randomised stepped-wedge study design, where we in a staggered way implement the ED pharmacists in all three EDs after a 3, 6 and 9 months control period, respectively. We will include all patients going through the three EDs during the 12-month study period. Patient data will be collected retrospectively from national data registries, the hospital system and from patient records.

Introduction Dental settings have not traditionally functioned as access points to the health care system, however they can serve patients who may not otherwise seek routine health care. Millions of Americans annually visit either a dental or primary care provider, but not always both as recommended, even though multiple health co-morbidities can manifest in and impact oral health. Offering multidisciplinary health services in a dental setting has potential to reach unserved populations. Description Innovative partnerships between schools of dentistry, pharmacy, social work, and nursing were designed to promote integrated service delivery in the emerging workforce and the purposeful inclusion of oral health in integrated care settings. Discussion Oral complications of systemic disease and systemic complications of oral disease impose significant burdens on populations and the public health infrastructure in terms of economic cost, disability, and mortality. Exacerbated by the lack of integrated services, intersecting social, economic, and health issues perpetuate disparities and negative health outcomes. Care is often focused on reactive rather than preventive measures therefore addressing only the acute issue instead of the underlying, causative problem(s).

245,34824649,"Impact of Pharmaceutical Interventions in Hospitalized Patients: A Comparative Study Between Clinical Pharmacists and an Explicit Criteria-Based Tool. Background It has been well recognized that pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) can prevent patient harm related to prescribing errors. Various tools have been developed to facilitate the detection and the reduction of inappropriate prescriptions and some have shown benefit on clinical outcomes. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical, economical, and organizational impact of interventions generated by clinical pharmacists in hospitalized patients, and to evaluate the performance of an explicit tool, the Potentially Inappropriate Medication Checklist for Patients in Internal Medicine (PIM-Check), in detecting each pharmacist's intervention. Methods A cohort retrospective study was conducted on hospitalized patients. The impact of PIs based on pharmacists' standard examination was evaluated using the Clinical, Economic, and Organizational (CLEO) tool. The performance of PIM-Check in detecting each intervention was assessed by conducting a retrospective medication review based on available information collected from patients' records. A qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the types of PIs that PIM-Check failed to detect. Results The study was performed on 162 patients with a median age of 68 years (interquartile range = 46-77 years) and a median hospital stay of 5 days (interquartile range = 4-7 days). The pharmacists generated 1.9 PIs per patient (n = 304) of which 31% were detected by PIM-Check. The acceptance rate of the interventions by physicians was 84% (n = 255). Among the accepted interventions, 53% (n = 136) had a clinical impact graded CL ≥ 2C (moderate or major), whereas the majority of them were not detected by PIM-Check (63%; 86 out of 136). In addition, 46% of accepted interventions (n = 117) were associated with a cost decrease, among which 62% were not detected by PIM-Check (73 out of 117). The qualitative analysis shows that PIM-Check mostly failed to detect PIs related to dose adjustment, overprescribing, and therapy monitoring.

The Board Certified Psychiatric Pharmacist (BCPP) specialty certification was launched by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties in 1994. Candidates for the BCPP can qualify for the examination through 3 possible pathways: practice experience (4 years) in the specialty, completion of a PGY-1 residency plus an additional 2 years of practice experience, or completion of a PGY-2 specialty residency in psychiatric pharmacy. Recent fluctuations in the passing rate raised questions as to explanatory factors. This article represents the first published comprehensive study of candidate performance on the BCPP Examination. It describes a retrospective, observational study presenting (a) statistical trends of examination passing rates for biannual cohorts over the past 5 years, as well as (b) score distributions on the 3 performance domains of the certification. Pass-rate trend analyses suggest that variation in the proportion of eligibility pathway cohorts in the respective testing samples explains some of the fluctuation in passing rates. An analysis of variance of domain-level scores, using groups defined by eligibility pathway, yielded significant differences for nearly all group comparisons.

Outcome measures included pharmacists' willingness to immunise, service requirements, barriers and education needs. Results The questionnaire was sent out to 3086 community pharmacists of which 380 responses were included in the final analysis (12.3%). Willingness to administer immunisations after appropriate training and legislative regulation was stated by 82.6% (n = 314) of participants. It was demonstrated that pharmacists willing to immunise were significantly younger than their counterpart (38 [IQR 31-49] years vs. 45 [IQR 37.5-54] years; OR 1.06; 1.03-1.09, 95% CI; p < 0.001).

BACKGROUND The prevalence of clinical inertia, the failure of appropriate treatment intensification in diabetes treatment, is a well-documented worldwide phenomenon. This project addresses the problem of clinical inertia through three interrelated activities, clinical decision support (CDSS), team-based care, and patient engagement in diabetes management. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this research is to provide analysis under the State-University Partnership Learning Network regarding the impact of an electronic decision support tool combined with team-based care workflow on provider decision-making and patient outcomes for the treatment of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (diabetes) among patients receiving Kentucky Medicaid. The objectives of this study are to 1) assess clinical outcomes of type 2 diabetes in the Medicaid population with team-based care using CDSS, 2) evaluate physicians' and pharmacists' experience on CDSS. METHODS This is a quality improvement project using a mixed-method - longitudinal and control group comparison of outcomes based upon clinical measures and online surveys of providers and pharmacists involved in this project. RESULTS Patients treated by providers who changed the treatment regimen to one that either fully or partially followed the recommendation of the CDSS tool had a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c with an average initial HbA1c of 10.1 and the final HbA1c of 8. The online survey of physicians shows that more than 80% of physicians agree the use of CDSS will support improved patient outcomes. The use of a team-based care approach that includes pharmacists in implementing treatment changes was broadly supported by both physicians and pharmacists. CONCLUSION CDSS combined with team-based care can be effective in reducing HbA1c to targeted therapeutic levels. The use of CDSS provides a way to efficiently assess more than 160 potential frontline drugs and properly accelerate treatment. Consistent with the research literature, the inclusion of pharmacists can play a key role in team-based care to assess treatment alternatives and provide for improvement in outcomes and patient adherence for diabetes. The user surveys show both physicians and pharmacists have a positive attitude toward CDSS.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
250,34827215,"Endolysin, a Promising Solution against Antimicrobial Resistance.  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis for human public health which threatens the effective prevention and control of ever-increasing infectious diseases. The advent of pandrug-resistant bacteria makes most, if not all, available antibiotics invalid. Meanwhile, the pipeline of novel antibiotics development stagnates, which prompts scientists and pharmacists to develop unconventional antimicrobials. Bacteriophage-derived endolysins are cell wall hydrolases which could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan layer from within and outside of bacterial pathogens. With high specificity, rapid action, high efficiency, and low risk of resistance development, endolysins are believed to be among the best alternative therapeutic agents to treat multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. As of now, endolysins have been applied to diverse aspects. In this review, we comprehensively introduce the structures and activities of endolysins and summarize the latest application progress of recombinant endolysins in the fields of medical treatment, pathogen diagnosis, food safety, and agriculture.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are at high risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to polypharmacy. Little is known about type and frequency of DDIs within German ICUs. Clinical pharmacists' interventions (PI) recorded in a national database (ADKA-DokuPIK) were filtered for ICU patients. Binary DDIs involving ≥1 anti-infective agent with >1 database entry were selected. A modified two-step Delphi process with a group of senior hospital pharmacists was employed to evaluate selected DDIs for clinical relevance by using a five-point scale and to develop guidance for clinical practice. In total, 16,173 PI were recorded, including 1836 (11%) DDIs in the ICU setting. Of the latter, 41% (756/1836) included ≥1 anti-infective agent, 32% (590/1836) were binary DDIs, and 25% (455/1836) were listed at least twice. This translates into 88 different DDIs, 74% (65/88) of which were rated as being clinically relevant by our expert panel. The majority of DDIs (76% [67/88]) included macrolides, antifungals, or fluoroquinolones. This percentage was even higher in DDIs being rated as clinically relevant by the experts (85% [55/65]). It is noted that an inter-professional discussion and approach is needed in the individual patient management of DDIs. The guidance developed might be a tool for decision support.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
254,34828541,"How Community Pharmacists Perceive Ethics in Clinical Research: A Qualitative Study.  In recent years, the importance of building evidence in clinical practice that is increasingly acknowledged globally has been recognized in Japan as well, and it is expected that clinical research by community pharmacists will grow. In Japan, however, community pharmacists have few opportunities to learn about research ethics and may lack the training to make ethical decisions. We conducted a questionnaire survey of community pharmacists (n = 200) using a free descriptive format to understand how they perceived research ethics. Our qualitative analysis of 170 respondents revealed various perspectives (<A pharmacist's grounding>, <How pharmacists perceive research>, and <Ethical issues entailed by research>) of Japanese pharmacists on ethics in the context of clinical research. With respect to how to understand research, the following perspectives were found: ""research that prioritizes researchers,"" ""research that prioritizes research subjects (patients),"" and ""research that enters into regular work."" The perspectives on ""research that prioritizes research subjects (patients)"" and ""research that enters into regular work"" may inadvertently lead to ethically inappropriate research due to mismatch in professional values or poor understanding of research. These findings can contribute to the development of an educational program for community pharmacists on research ethics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacist prescribing practices were introduced into law in Poland in 2002, permitting pharmacists to prescribe medications in emergency situations and in 2020 the new law allowed to prescribe in all situation where it is needed because of the health risks reasons. Our aim was to analyze pharmacist prescribing practices in Poland and confirm the useful of pharmacists' activity in this area. Additionally, pharmacists were also authorized to issue reimbursed prescriptions for themselves or their family members. Since January 2020, only e-prescriptions are allowed in Poland. A retrospective analysis of the inspection written reports from 842 community pharmacies in the representative region of Poland with a population of two million, carried out in the time period from 2002 to 2016 was performed (2189 prescriptions) to assess the emergency pharmacist prescribing practices in Poland. The second part of the research was based on digital data on pharmacists prescriptions (18,529) provided by the e-Health Centre (a governmental organization under the Ministry of Health responsible for the development of health care information systems in Poland), enabling to conduct the analysis of pharmacist's prescribing from 1 of April 2020 to 31 of October 2020. The analysis gave the insight of the evolution of the pharmacy prescribing patterns. In general, pharmaceutical prescriptions were issued in cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, in town- or city center pharmacies, and in pharmacies in residential areas. The most common reason for a pharmaceutical prescription was that the patient was running out of a medicine and was unable to contact their physician. Cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatological, and digestive medications were most frequently prescribed.

256,34828586,"Regulation Awareness and Experience of Additional Monitoring among Healthcare Professionals in Finland. BACKGROUND Challenges in post-marketing adverse event reporting are generally recognized. To enhance reporting, the concept of additional monitoring was introduced in 2012. Additional monitoring aims to enhance reporting of adverse events (AE) for medicines for which the clinical evidence base is less well developed. PURPOSE The purpose was to get a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons why additional monitoring has not increased AE reporting as much as initially hoped. We examined how healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Finland perceive additional monitoring, why they do or do not report AEs more readily for these medicines and how they interact with patients treated with additionally monitored medicines. METHODS An anonymous, open questionnaire was developed and made available online at the e-form portal of University of Helsinki. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists were invited to complete the questionnaire via their respective trade or area unions. Content analysis of answers to open-ended questions was performed by two independent coders. RESULTS Pharmacists have the best understanding about additional monitoring but at the same time do not recognize their role in enhancing monitoring. Only 40% of HCPs working with patients knows always or often if a specific medicine is additionally monitored. Half (53%) of HCPs do not tell or tell only rarely patients about additional monitoring. 18% of HCPs reported having received additional monitoring training whereas 29% had received general AE reporting training. AE reporting was more common among HCPs who had received training. CONCLUSIONS Additional monitoring awareness among HCPs and patients should be increased by organizing regular educational events and making additional monitoring more visible. Educational events should emphasize the significance additional monitoring has on patient safety and promote a reporting culture among HCPs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the clinical and humanistic outcomes of community pharmacy-based interventions on medication-related problems of older adults at the primary care level. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the impact of various community pharmacy-based interventions from five electronic databases (namely, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL, APA PSYInfo, and Scopus) from January 2010 to December 2020. Consequently, we assessed these interventions' clinical and humanistic outcomes on older adults and compared them with non-intervention. We included 13 RCTs in the current review and completed a meta-analysis with six of them. The included studies had a total of 6173 older adults. Quantitative analysis showed that patient education was significantly associated with an increase in the discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics use (risk ratio 1.28; 95% CI (1.20, 1.36) I2 = 0%, p < 0.00001). Moreover, the qualitative analysis showed that medication reviews and education with follow-ups could improve various clinical outcomes, including reducing adverse drug events, reducing uncontrolled health outcomes, and improving appropriate medication use among the elderly population. However, medication review could not significantly reduce the number of older adults who fall (risk ratio 1.25; 95% CI (0.78, 1.99) I2 = 0%, p = 0.36) and require hospitalization (risk ratio 0.72; 95% CI (0.47, 1.12) I2 = 45%, p = 0.15). This study showed that community pharmacy-based interventions could help discontinue inappropriate prescription medications among older adults and could improve several clinical and humanistic outcomes.

Community pharmacies have recently joined Taiwan's primary care system; they have great potential to provide professional healthcare services. This study examined whether the services provided by community pharmacists enhance medication adherence, enable the identification and solution of drug therapy problems, and are accepted by community residents. The Department of Public Health, Taoyuan City, collaborated with the Taoyuan Pharmacist Association over 11 months in 2018 in enabling pharmacists to dispense prescriptions and provide medication adherence consultations, cognitive services, and home and institutional medical care services. This study designed four satisfaction questionnaires to assess the feasibility and performance of these services. Regarding the services related to medication knowledge and adherence, 92.10% of the patients reported overall satisfaction, and all understanding and ability scores were improved in more than 95% of patients. The number of patients highly cooperative regarding their medication had risen from 14 to 234 after the intervention, and the number with low medication adherence had dropped from 533 to 33. More than 90% of respondents indicated that the institutional medical care services had significantly improved their medication knowledge and behaviors.

This study aimed to report the effectiveness of community pharmacy smoking cessation services in 13 health regions in Thailand using a retrospective data-collecting method from the Foundation of Community Pharmacy database. The participants were smokers aged at least 18 years. The outcomes were the abstinence of smoking at least 30 consecutive days by self-report only and self-report with exhaled CO level <7 ppm (if available), the number of cigarettes smoked daily, exhaled carbon monoxide (exhaled CO), and % peak expiratory flow rate (%PEFR); smokers measured these outcomes before and after receiving the smoking cessation services. Of 58 community pharmacies, 532 smokers (93% male, mean age of 42.4 ± 14.9 years) received smoking cessation services from community pharmacists. Of 235 smokers with complete data, 153 (28.8%, 153/532) smokers reported smoking abstinence by self-report.

261,34832870,"Discordance to ASHP Therapeutic Guidelines Increases the Risk of Surgical Site Infection.  Clean surgery without contamination does not require prophylactic antibiotics, but there are high-risk surgical procedures that may cause infection and/or involve vital organs such as the heart, brain, and lungs, and these indeed require the use of antibiotics. This study aimed to determine the quantity of antibiotic use based on the defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 bed days and the quality of antibiotic use based on the percentage of concordance with The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) therapeutic guidelines (i.e., route of administration, time of administration, selection, dose, and duration). This includes the profiles of surgical site infection (SSI) in surgical patients from January through June 2019. The study subjects were 487 surgical patients from two hospitals who met the inclusion criteria. There were 322 patients out of 487 patients who had a clean surgical procedure. Ceftriaxone (J01DD04) was the most used antibiotic, with a total DDD/100 bed days value in hospitals A and B, respectively: pre-surgery: 14.71, 77.65, during surgery: 22.57, 87.31, and postsurgery: 38.34, 93.65. In addition, 35% of antibiotics were given more than 120 min before incision. The lowest concordance to ASHP therapeutic guideline in hospital A (17.6%) and B (1.9%) was antibiotic selection. Two patients experienced SSI with bacterial growths of Proteus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. The usage of prophylactic antibiotics for surgical procedures was high and varied between hospitals. Hospital B had significantly lower concordance to antibiotic therapeutic guidelines, resulting to a higher infection rate, compared with hospital A. ASHP adherence components were then further investigated, after which antibiotic dosing interval and injection time was found to be a significant predictor for positive bacterial growth based on logit-logistic regression.

262,34834378,"Critical Aspects in the Preparation of Extemporaneous Flecainide Acetate Oral Solution for Paediatrics.  The availability of liquid oral preparations compounded by pharmacists is essential to meet paediatric needs which remain unanswered by the pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, compendial monographs are often not available and, in many cases, pre-formulation studies (e.g., compatibility with other excipients and solubility evaluations) are not performed in-depth, leading, in some rare cases, to the inadvertent administration of a toxic dose. In this study, the preparation of an oral liquid formulation for paediatric use, containing flecainide acetate at different strengths, was considered, taking into account the possible effects of conventionally used excipients. First, the optimal vehicle was selected based on a solubility study, evidencing some unexpected formations of precipitates. As a matter of fact, the buffers commonly used for oral solutions significantly reduced flecainide solubility, and the concomitant presence of citrate buffer and methylparaben even caused the formation of non-resuspendable crystals. Then, chemical, physical, and microbiological stability were assessed. Solutions at strengths of 10 and 20 mg/mL flecainide acetate were stable up to 8 weeks when compounded by using a 40% sucrose solution as a vehicle.

The objective of this systematic review was to summarize existing literature on perceived barriers to administering HPV vaccination reported by pharmacists. Barriers identified from selected studies were synthesized and further grouped into patient, parental, (pharmacist's) personal, and system/organization barrier groups. Six studies were included in this review. The cost of the HPV vaccine, insurance coverage and reimbursement were commonly reported perceived barriers. Adolescent HPV vaccination barriers related to parental concerns, beliefs, and inadequate knowledge about the HPV vaccine. Perceived (pharmacist's) personal barriers were related to lack of information and knowledge about HPV vaccine and recommendations. At the system/organization level, barriers reported included lack of time/staff/space; difficulty in series completion; tracking and recall of patient; perceived competition with providers; and other responsibilities/vaccines taking precedence.

BACKGROUND Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are considered essential tools to analyze spatially referenced health data. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this scoping review is to describe how GIS is used in pharmacy specific health research. METHODS During July 2020, the following databases were searched: EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science and Scopus. The search strategy included terms relating to spatial analysis and pharmacy. Studies were considered eligible if they involved the use of GIS and focused on pharmacies. A narrative and tabular synthesis of the results was carried out, structured around the spatial analysis methods utilized across studies, as well as the characteristics of pharmacies evaluated in studies. RESULTS After a review of 6967 sources, 48 studies were included in this review. Twenty-nine studies were conducted in the United States (60.4%) and thirty-six focused on accessibility (75.0%; n = 36). Twenty-two studies investigated the relationship between sociodemographic aspects of the population and the accessibility and availability of pharmacies (45.8%). Twelve studies (25.0%) performed distance analysis and six studies (12.5%) performed geostatistical analysis. Community pharmacies were the setting evaluated most frequently, with over-the-counter selling products being the most evaluated pharmacy variable (13.3%; n = 6).

BACKGROUND Cambodian Americans have high rates of cardiometabolic and psychiatric disorders and disadvantaged social determinants of health (SDOH). These factors can make it challenging to resolve drug therapy problems (DTPs) and improve medication-related outcomes. This manuscript reports planned analyses from a randomized controlled trial in which participants were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms: (1) community health worker (CHW)-delivered lifestyle intervention called Eat, Walk, sleep (EWS), (2) EWS plus pharmacist/CHW-delivered medication therapy management (EWS + MTM), or (3) social services (SS: control). OBJECTIVES We compared the 3 arms on changes in self-reported medication adherence, barriers, and beliefs. Within the EWS + MTM arm only, we assessed the impact of EWS + MTM on DTP resolution and examined predictors of DTP resolution. METHODS Cambodian Americans at the age of 35-75 years at high risk of developing diabetes and meeting the criteria for likely depression (N = 188) were randomized (EWS, n = 67; EWS + MTM, n = 63; SS, n = 50; control). For all participants, self-reported surveys were collected at baseline, 12 months, and 15 months. DTPs were assessed on the same schedule but only for participants in the EWS + MTM. RESULTS All 3 groups reported a significant decrease in barriers to taking medications. Compared with the other arms, the EWS + MTM arm reported a decrease in forgetting to take medications at 15 months. In the EWS + MTM arm, mean DTPs per patient was 6.57 and 84% of DTPs were resolved. SDOH predictors of DTP resolution included years of education (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, P = 0.016), ability to write English (OR 0.73, P = 0.015), difficulty communicating with provider (OR 1.39, P < 0.001), private insurance (OR 1.99, P = 0.030), disability (OR 0.51, P = 0.008), and years living under Pol Pot (OR 0.66, P = 0.045).

The movement has, however, yet to manifest substantive institutional changes for entities to reassess the ways in which they, their methodologies, and their teachings have historically and contemporarily contributed to the dissolution of Black lives. The profession of pharmacy explicitly states it is committed to achieving optimal patient outcomes. However, teaching race as a socio-political construct is not an Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) minimal standard requirement. This continued neglect is a disservice to the field and the communities served, and this informative article explores the role of pharmacy in perpetuating physical and psychological harm to patients within Black communities. Conflating race with ancestry and approaching race as a simple biological construction/predictor is misinformed, presumptuous, and simplistic, as well as physically and psychologically harmful to patients. Rather than default to racialized historical myths imbedded in contemporary society, pharmacy must answer the call and undertake definitive action to ensure comprehensive education to better care for Black communities. It is vital that schools and colleges of pharmacy actively seeks to correct curricular neglect based on negative, pseudo-scientific constructions of ""race.""

Introduction Egypt has the ninth highest diabetes mellitus (DM) prevalence in the world. There is a growing interest in community involvement in DM management. Aim of the study The aim of the study was to evaluate the tailored diabetes care model (DCM) implementation in Alexandria governorate by community pharmacy-based intervention (CPBI) from a clinical, humanistic, and economic aspect. Methods This is a 6-month period cross-over cluster randomized control trial conducted in Alexandria. Ten clusters owing 10 community pharmacies (CPs) recruited 100 health insurance-deprived T2DM patients with >7% HbA1c in 6-months. The study was divided into 2 phases (3 months for each period) with a 1-month washout period in between. After CPs training on DCM, the interventional group received pictorial training for 45 minutes in first visit, and 15 minutes in weekly visits, whereas the control group patients received the usual care (UC). At baseline and end of each phase (3 months), patients had clinical and physical activity assessments, filled all forms of study questionnaire (knowledge, self-management, satisfaction, and adherence) and did all laboratory investigations (Fasting Blood Glucose [FBG]), HbA1c, protein-creatinine clearance (PCR), creatine clearance (GFR), and lipid profile. Results There was no significant difference in the basal systolic and diastolic blood pressure between patients in the CBPI and UC groups, but the CBPI had significantly decreased the mean SBP and DBP by (P = .008, .040, respectively). Also, significant waist circumference and BMI reductions (-5.82 cm and -1.86 kg/m2, P = .001) were observed in the CBPI. The CBPI patients achieved a greater reduction in FBG and HbA1C than the UC patients (102 mg/dL and 1.9%, respectively P < .001). Also, significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride (-6.4, -15.4, and -6.3 mg/dL respectively, P = .001) were achieved in the CBPI group. No significant differences were found in HDL, GFR, and PCR. Moreover, significant improvements of behavior, score of knowledge, self-management, satisfaction, and adherence were observed in CBPI patients. After multivariate analysis, HbA1C readings were significantly influenced by baseline HbA1C and eating habits. The cost saving for CPBI was -1581 LE per 1% HbA1c reduction.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Clinical pharmacists' involvement in the care of solid organ transplant recipients has been discussed worldwide given its potential to improve clinical outcomes. As thoracic transplant activity grows in Brazil, it is important to understand how pharmacists are inserted in transplant programmes nationwide. We conducted a survey to explore clinical pharmacy activities in thoracic transplant centres in Brazil and compared them with accredited programmes in the United States. METHODS An electronic questionnaire was distributed to all 40 heart and lung transplant centres registered in the Brazilian Organ Transplantation Agency (ABTO) in May 2019. Survey findings were compared to previously published data from accredited U.S. centres. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION From 22 centre respondents, ten (45.5%) declared not to have a pharmacist at any part of the transplantation process, which translated into 158 (37.6%) transplant recipients without any direct pharmaceutical care. In centres with pharmacists (n = 12), none had a full-time professional dedicated to their heart and/or lung programmes. When compared to U.S. centres, there was a significantly lower insertion of clinical pharmacist activities among Brazilian centres. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Our findings point to an unmet need related to clinical pharmacy activity within thoracic transplant programmes, especially in a developing country, and highlight a call for action in order to reach higher accredited regulatory standards regarding pharmacist-driven workforce in transplant care worldwide.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

In this position paper the authors bring attention to the significant strain that patients and family caregivers experience when navigating and negotiating this aspect of palliative and end-of-life care. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH Focussing on self-care and organisation of medicines in the United Kingdom (UK) context, the paper examines, builds on and extends the debate by considering the underlying policy assumptions and unintended consequences for individual patients and family care givers as they assume greater palliative and end-of-life roles and responsibilities. FINDINGS Policy makers and healthcare professionals often lack awareness of the significant burden and emotional work associated with managing and administering often potent high-risk medicines (i.e. opioids) in the domiciliary setting. The recent ""revolution"" in professional roles associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote consultations and expanding community-based care, means there are opportunities for commissioners to consider offering greater support. The prospect of enhancing the community pharmacist's medicine optimisation role to further support the wider multi-disciplinary team is considered. ORIGINALITY/VALUE The paper takes a person-focused perspective and adopts a holistic view of medicine management. The authors argue for urgent review, reform and investment to enable and support terminally ill patients and family caregivers to more effectively manage medicines in the domiciliary setting. There are clear implications for pharmacists and these are discussed in the context of public awareness, inter-professional collaboration, organisational drivers, funding and regulation and remote care delivery.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
276,34842029,"Estimation of the cost of influenza antiviral medication guidance or support provided by healthcare professionals: A questionnaire survey in Japan. AIMS To estimate the cost of antiviral medication guidance and/or support from the perspective of healthcare professionals by administration route (oral or inhalant). METHODS An online survey (December 2020) was conducted among physicians, pharmacists, and certified care workers. Those aged 20-64 years working in workplaces with experience of prescribing (physicians) or dispensing (pharmacists) antivirals for influenza, or having care service recipients who took antivirals (certified care workers) since October 2018, were selected through screening questions. The time required for guidance and/or support for drug administration was asked, and its monetary value was calculated by applying the Japanese average wage. Respondents who had a fear of infection while providing guidance and/or support were asked about the monetary value of this fear; the cost of fear was estimated from their responses and the percentage who reported such a fear. RESULTS Responses were collected from 1,000 physicians, 1,000 pharmacists, and 642 certified care workers. The cost of the time for guidance and/or support in the entire workplace was estimated as JPY 244 (USD 2.14, as of October 2021) for oral antivirals and JPY 289 for inhalants among physicians, JPY 260 and JPY 428 among pharmacists, and JPY 555 and JPY 557 among certified care workers. The cost of fear was estimated to be JPY 965 for oral and JPY 1,361 for inhalants among physicians, JPY 756 and JPY 2,711 among pharmacists, and JPY 2,419 and JPY 2,837 among certified care workers. LIMITATIONS Respondents might not be representative of Japanese society. The reliability of the results depends on whether the respondents accurately understood the questions and their truthfulness. CONCLUSIONS Higher costs for guidance and/or support were suggested for inhalant antivirals in physicians and pharmacists compared to oral antivirals. For certified care workers, almost no difference in costs was suggested between administration routes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
277,34842545,"Including the Reason for Use on Prescriptions Sent to Pharmacists: Scoping Review. BACKGROUND In North America, although pharmacists are obligated to ensure prescribed medications are appropriate, information about a patient's reason for use is not a required component of a legal prescription. The benefits of prescribers including the reason for use on prescriptions is evident in the current literature. However, it is not standard practice to share this information with pharmacists. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to characterize the research on how including the reason for use on a prescription impacts pharmacists. METHODS We performed an interdisciplinary scoping review, searching literature in the fields of health care, informatics, and engineering. The following databases were searched between December 2018 and January 2019: PubMed, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), and EMBASE. RESULTS A total of 3912 potentially relevant articles were identified, with 9 papers meeting the inclusion criteria. The studies used different terminology (eg, indication, reason for use) and a wide variety of study methodologies, including prospective and retrospective observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and qualitative interviews and focus groups. The results suggest that including the reason for use on a prescription can help the pharmacist catch more errors, reduce the need to contact prescribers, support patient counseling, impact communication, and improve patient safety. Reasons that may prevent prescribers from adding the reason for use information are concerns about workflow and patient privacy. CONCLUSIONS More research is needed to understand how the reason for use information should be provided to pharmacists. In the limited literature to date, there is a consensus that the addition of this information to prescriptions benefits patient safety and enables pharmacists to be more effective. Future research should use an implementation science or theory-based approach to improve prescriber buy-in and, consequently, adoption.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

281,34842809,"Medication Utilisation Program, Quality Improvement and Research Pharmacist-Implementation Strategies and Preliminary Findings.  Judicious use of medicines that considers evidence-based practice, together with cost-effectiveness, is a priority for all health care organisations. We describe an initiative to lead a Medication Utilisation Program, incorporating medication quality improvement and research activities. In August 2020 an advanced pharmacist position was implemented to lead the Program. The purpose was to provide oversight and facilitate initiatives promoting medication optimisation to create sustainable change in practice. A strategic plan was developed with key performance indicators. A governance structure was implemented with relevant reporting mechanisms. Strategic planning and collaboration with medical, nursing and allied health professionals has seen the successful implementation of seven codesigned medication-use evaluations and eight quality improvement projects centred around patient safety, quality and value-based care. Several research studies have been designed with subsequent commencement of pharmacists enrolled in university Research Higher Degree programs. Cost containment initiatives have realised potential savings approximating AUD 250,000. Educational programs included protocol design, ethics approvals and report writing. Key success criteria for a Medication Utilisation Program include dedicated pharmacist resources, structured governance and reporting mechanisms.

282,34842810,"Dose Administration Aid Service in Community Pharmacies: Characterization and Impact Assessment.  Adherence to therapies is a primary determinant of treatment success. Lack of medication adherence is often associated with medical and psychosocial issues due to complications from underlying conditions and is an enormous waste of medical resources. Dose Administration Aid Service (DAAS) can be seen as part of the solution, allowing individual medicine doses to be organized according to the dosing schedule determined by the patient's prescriber. The most recent systematic reviews admit the possibility of a positive impact of this service. In line with this background, the study reported in this paper aimed to characterize DAAS implementation in Portugal and understand the perceptions of pharmacists and owners of community pharmacies regarding the impact of DAAS, preferred methodology types, and State contribution. The study was guided by qualitative description methodology and reported using the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 18 pharmacists and/or owners of community pharmacies. Using qualitative content analysis, we identified categories that revealed that automated weekly methodology is the preferred methodology, because of its easiness of use and lower cost of preparation. However, the investment cost was felt to be too high by the participants considering the number of potential users for implementation in practice. Participants were also unanimous in recognizing that DAAS has a very positive impact in terms of safety and medication adherence, and the majority agreed that it also helped reduce medication waste. Implications of these findings for medication adherence are discussed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
283,34842813,"Physicians' Opinion Regarding Extended Access to Hormonal Contraception in Switzerland.  (1) Background: Access to hormonal contraceptives (HC) strongly differs between countries and varies from over the counter (OTC) to prescription-only availability. This study aimed to identify opinions among physicians in Switzerland regarding extended access to HC. (2) Methods: Web-based survey among physicians (gynecologists, general practitioners, and pediatricians) in Switzerland. (3) Results: Hundred sixty-three physicians, mainly gynecologists, participated in this survey and 147 (90%) were included for analysis. A total of 68% (n = 100) answered that prescription-only status could be extended under certain conditions but physicians were concerned about patients' safety (97%, n = 142). Moreover, there was concern about insufficient patient education on HC (93%, n = 136) and that women may forego preventive examinations (80%, n = 118). Participants did not support OTC availability (93%, n = 136). Pharmacists prescribing (including initiation of HC) revealed controversial results, but a combined access model (initial prescription from physician and follow-up prescriptions by pharmacists) found acceptance in 70% (n = 103). (4) Conclusions: Participating physicians stated that prescription-only status for HC could be lifted under certain conditions but also some concerns, e.g., patients' safety or neglection of preventive examinations, were raised.

This study assesses the level of agreement on medication therapy problem (MTP) identification and classification between primary care, ambulatory care pharmacists within a health-system that recently implemented system-wide pharmacist provision of comprehensive medication management (CMM) services. Twenty standardized case vignettes were created and distributed to pharmacists who reviewed each case and identified and categorized MTPs. Outcomes include the number of MTPs identified, identification (yes/no) of specific MTPs within each case (e.g., need for a statin), and Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) category used when classifying MTPs. The level of agreement on MTP identification/categorization was measured using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and interpreted using the Landis and Koch interpretation scale. ""Moderate agreement"" was observed for the number of MTPs identified by pharmacists (ICC equal to 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 0.65). In approximately one-half of opportunities, the pharmacists agreed perfectly on the number of MTPs; in approximately one-third of opportunities, the number of MTPs identified varied by 1; and approximately one-tenth of the time, the number of MTPs varied by 2. In regard to the MTP identification (yes/no) and categorization, percent agreement was ≥73% across all MTPs.

The American Diabetes Association recommends that patients with type II diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease be prescribed an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist for cardioprotective benefit. This project assessed the use of these medications in this patient population in a rural clinic by measuring prescribing rates of SGLT-2/GLP-1 therapy before and after pharmacist interventions. Of the 60 patients identified at baseline, 39.39% (13/33) managed by a pharmacist were prescribed SGLT-2/GLP-1 therapy compared to the 14.81% (4/27) who had not seen a pharmacist (p = 0.025). Of the 43 patients that were not on SGLT-2/GLP-1 therapy at baseline, 13 were lost to follow-up and 13 had contraindications. For the 17 remaining patients, pharmacists recommended initiating SGLT-2/GLP-1 therapy and were able to successfully initiate therapy for 9 patients (52.94%). Pharmacist interventions improved the prescription rates from a baseline of 36.17% (17/47) to 55.3% (26/47) (p = 0.002), with SGLT-2/GLP-1 therapy contraindicated in 27.66% (13/47) of patients.

Little is known about health professions students' awareness and attitudes regarding public health in the United States. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess medical and pharmacy students' knowledge and interest in the Healthy People initiative as well as perceptions of public health content in their curricula. An electronic survey was distributed in March 2021 in seven schools across Ohio; participation was incentivized through a USD 5 donation to the Ohio Association of Foodbanks to aid in COVID-19 relief efforts (maximum USD 1000) for each completed survey. A total of 182 medical students and 233 pharmacy students participated (12% response rate). Less than one-third of respondents reported familiarity with Healthy People and correctly identified the latest edition. However, nearly all respondents agreed public health initiatives are valuable to the American healthcare system. Almost all students expressed a desire to practice interprofessionally to attain public health goals. Both medical and pharmacy students recognized core public health topics in their curricula, and nearly 90% wanted more information. These findings indicate that the majority of medical and pharmacy students in Ohio believe public health initiatives to be important, yet knowledge gaps exist regarding Healthy People.

Retaining people living with HIV (PLWH) in clinical care is a global priority to end the HIV epidemic. Community pharmacies in the United States have structural influences on the success or failure of retention in HIV care by supporting patients' complex needs. However, to date, barriers to retention in care in the community pharmacy setting have not been examined beyond pharmacy services of medication therapy management. We utilized the patient-centered medical home model to examine the barriers to HIV care in the community pharmacy setting. We utilized semi-structured interviews to collect data from 15 participants: five PLWH, five community pharmacists, and five social workers from a midwestern state. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed using directed content analysis. Four key themes emerged regarding the barriers that impact utilization of community pharmacy services by PLWH: the perception of the role of community pharmacists in HIV care, perceptions of pharmacists' HIV knowledge, perceptions of pharmacy operation and services, and negative experiences within the community pharmacy space. Participants' perceptions of solutions for improving HIV care in the community pharmacy focused on improving the relationship between pharmacists and patients, ensuring that the community pharmacy is a private and safe space for patients, and having a diverse pharmacy staff that is equipped to take care of the diverse and marginalized HIV population, such as transgender people.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION The provision of quality health care during the COVID-19 pandemic depends largely on the health of health care providers. However, healthcare providers as the frontline caregivers dealing with infected patients, are more vulnerable to mental health problems. Despite this fact, there is scarce information regarding the mental health impact of COVID-19 among frontline health care providers in South-West Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the levels and predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among frontline healthcare providers in Gurage zonal public hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 health care providers from November 10-25, 2020 in Gurage zonal health institutions. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A pretested self -administered structured questionnaire was used as a data collection technique. The data were entered into the Epi-data version 3.01 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (chi-square tests) were presented Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression analyses were made to identify variables having a significant association with the dependent variables. RESULTS The results of this study had shown that the overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 36%, [95% CI = (30.7%- 41.3%)], 25.8% [95% CI = (21.1%- 30.4%)] and 31.4% [95% CI = (26.4%- 36.0%)] respectively. Age, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR = 7.9], Educational status, [AOR = 3.2], low monthly income [AOR = 1.87], and presence of infected family members [AOR = 3.3] were statistically associated with anxiety. Besides this, gender, [AOR = 1.9], masters [AOR = 10.8], and degree holder [AOR = 2.2], living with spouse [AOR = 5.8], and family [AOR = 3.9], being pharmacists [AOR = 4.5], and physician [AOR = (0.19)], were found to be statistically significant predictors of depression among health care providers. Our study finding also showed that working at general [AOR = 4.8], and referral hospitals [AOR = 3.2], and low monthly income [AOR = 2.3] were found to be statistically significant predictors of stress among health care providers. CONCLUSION Based on our finding significant numbers of healthcare providers were suffered from anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. So, the Government and other stakeholders should be involved and closely work and monitor the mental wellbeing of health care providers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

294,34844821,"Examining community pharmacists' intention to provide pharmacist-driven vaccination services: A structural equation modelling. BACKGROUND The evidence of pharmacists' current involvement in vaccination services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is uncertain. This study would be a first step to develop vaccination services by investigating community pharmacists' intention to be involved in PDV services not just during COVID-19 pandemic but also during standard service provision in Turkey which can be taken as an example across LMICs. OBJECTIVE Considering the efforts to empower community pharmacists in service provision, the goal of the present study was to develop a structural equation model to explain the ""Pharmacist-Driven Vaccination Service Intention Model (PDV-SIM)"" by using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). METHODS Based on the constructs of TPB, a measurement tool was developed. Sub-factors of PDV service intention was determined by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In the second step, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to prove the theoretical structure of the tool. Finally, a model explaining the relationship between observed variables, latent constructs from TPB was developed by SEM analysis. RESULTS In the proposed PDV-SIM, patient related attitude toward PDV services, attitude toward negative consequences of PDV services, and subjective norm about PDV services had an impact on the behavioral intention of community pharmacists. Nevertheless, professional development attitude toward PDV services and perceived behavioral control were not evaluated as determinants of the behavioral intention. CONCLUSION Results of this study revealed that TPB is appropriate for modelling PDV service intention of community pharmacists. This model can be utilized as a guide to potential pharmacy regulatory bodies and policy makers in their efforts to enable community pharmacists as vaccinators across LMICs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Adherence to treatment and hypoglycemia awareness are strongly linked to glycemic control and hypoglycemia risk in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Community pharmacies are suitable facilities to detect these conditions, and should be involved in the strategies to minimize the associated risks and burden. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This cross-sectional study conducted at community pharmacies across Spain assessed the prevalence of low adherence to antidiabetic treatments, the frequency of impaired hypoglycemia awareness, and their predictive factors. Adherence was measured with the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and electronic records of dispensed treatments. The Clarke questionnaire was used to assess impaired hypoglycemia awareness. Healthcare counseling provided in the pharmacy was collected. RESULTS Seventy-nine pharmacists and 618 subjects with T2DM participated in the study. Mean age in the overall T2DM population was 67 years, being the majority (69%) pensioners. Adherence was high in 41% of participants, medium in 35%, and low in 24% according to the MMAS-8. Impaired hypoglycemia awareness was observed in 25% of participants. Main determinants of low adherence were the level of education, the number of treatments per patient, hypoglycemia awareness, and the type of pharmacy. Predictive factors of impaired hypoglycemia awareness were the level of education, information on diabetes-related complications, adherence levels, and the type of pharmacy. The proportion of participants who had healthcare counseling was 71% in the overall population and 100% in subjects with impaired hypoglycemia awareness and low adherence. Healthcare counseling comprised diabetes education (69%), pharmacotherapeutic assessment (20%), and physician referrals (11%). CONCLUSION Lack of adherence to antidiabetic treatments and impaired hypoglycemia awareness are frequent and correlate in T2DM. Community pharmacies can detect these conditions and should have an active role in the design of strategies to minimize them.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
296,34846197,"Evaluation and clinical impact of a pharmacist-led, interdisciplinary service focusing on education, monitoring and toxicity management of immune checkpoint inhibitors. INTRODUCTION Immune-related adverse events are complications of immune checkpoint inhibitors which require robust patient education and proactive follow-up to ensure timely identification and management. Oncology pharmacist practice models with other anticancer modalities have been well documented, but there is limited evidence assessing the spectrum of pharmacist interventions in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor(s) and the impact of these interventions on patient outcomes. METHODS Patients initiated on immune checkpoint inhibitor(s) from 1 January 2016 to 31 August 2019 were included for data collection and analysis. Part 1 featured an intensive pharmacist follow-up cohort (study cohort) and summarized pharmacist interventions. Part 2 compared patient outcomes between the study cohort and a standard of care cohort (control cohort) from a different oncology centre. Patient outcomes included emergency department visits not resulting in admission, hospitalizations due to immune-related adverse event(s), immune checkpoint inhibitor cycles received, treatment discontinuation due to immune-related adverse event(s), completion of finite programmed death-1/death-1 ligand treatment course and completion of ipilimumab. Clinical outcomes were compared using a retrospective, matched cohort design based on age, cancer diagnosis and immune checkpoint inhibitor(s). RESULTS A total of 143 patients were included in Part 1 encompassing 1664 pharmacist recommendations across 11 categories. The matched cohort yielded 92 matches (n = 184) with a higher odds of immune checkpoint inhibitor discontinuation due to immune-related adverse event(s) in the control cohort (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 5.5 (1.2-24.8); p = 0.022). CONCLUSION Intensive immune-related adverse event education, proactive follow-up and immune-related adverse event management by pharmacists result in clinically meaningful interventions which correlate to improved patient outcomes, namely lower odds of treatment discontinuation due to immune-related adverse event(s).",1,1,1,1,,,Study,Oncology,Oncology,,,Ambulatory,Ambulatory,,

Outcomes of the study included the mean difference in the number of optimal (i) prescribed initial VCM doses (primary) (ii) dosage adjustments and (iii) VCM-sampling time (secondary). After ethical approval, data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS A hundred patients were there in each phase. The number of cases who were correctly prescribed initial VCM doses was significantly higher in the post-implementation phase, mean difference of 0.22, [95% CI (0.142-0.0.358), p < 0.0001]. Patients who had correct dosage adjustments in the post-implementation phase also had higher statistical significance, mean difference of 0.29, [95% CI (0.152-0.423), p < 0.05]. More correct practices of VCM-levels timing were observed in the post-implementation phase, mean difference of 0.15, [95% CI (- 0.053-0.264), p = 0.079]. CONCLUSION This study showed the significant role of pharmacist-directed TDM services to optimize the correct prescribing of initial VCM doses and dose adjustments.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,"Maternal / pediatric / neonatal, Infectious diseases","Maternal / pediatric / neonatal, Infectious diseases",,,Inpatient,Inpatient,,
298,34848159,"Harnessing the Potential of Primary Care Pharmacists to Improve Heart Failure Management. BACKGROUND Improved utilization of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) can reduce mortality, reduce heart failure hospitalizations, and improve quality of life. Despite well-established clinical guidelines, these therapies remain significantly underprescribed. The goal of this intervention was to increase prescribing of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), and beta-blockers at ≥ 50% target doses. METHODS The study team identified key drivers to adequate dosing of GDMT: (1) frequent and reliable follow-up visits for titration opportunities, (2) identification of actionable patients for therapy initiation and titration, and (3) reduction in prescribing practice variability. The interventions were implemented at an outpatient clinical site and consisted of three main components: (1) establishing a pharmacist-led heart failure medication titration clinic, (2) creation of a standardized titration protocol, and (3) utilization of a patient dashboard to identify eligible patients. RESULTS For patients seen in the titration clinic, in 14 months, the mean dose per patient increased from 31.3% to 70.5% of target dose for ACEI/ARB/ARNI, and from 45.8% to 85.4% for beta-blockers. At this clinical site, the percentage of HFrEF patients receiving > 50% of targeted dose increased from 39.7% to 46.7% for ACEI/ARB/ARNI, and from 39.5% to 42.9% for beta-blockers. For ACEI/ARB/ARNI, use of target doses was 5.9% higher (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.6%-8.3%, p < 0.0001) for the intervention site, 0.2% higher (95% CI = -2.2%-2.5%, p = 0.89) during the intervention period, and 10.4% higher (95% CI = 6.9%-13.9%, p < 0.0001) for the interaction (intervention site during the intervention time period). For beta-blockers, use of target doses was 1.0% higher (95% CI = -0.6%-2.6%, p = 0.20) for the intervention site, 0.8% lower (95% CI = -2.4%-0.8%, p = 0.29) for the intervention period, and 5.8% higher (95% CI = 3.5%-8.1%, p < 0.0001) for the interaction (intervention site during the intervention time period). CONCLUSION Through this project's interventions, the prescribing of ACEI/ARB/ARNI and beta-blocker therapy at ≥ 50% target doses for patients with HFrEF was increased. This study demonstrates the value of a multifaceted, team-based approach that integrates population-level interventions such as clinical dashboard management with a pharmacist-led heart failure medication titration clinic.",0,0,1,1,1,"Even though the study design cannot distinguish between the impact of the pharmacist and the clinic, there was an evaluation of the effect of pharmacist intervention comapred in a pre-post method.",Study,Cardiology,Cardiology,,,Ambulatory,Ambulatory,,
299,34848164,"Implementation of a self-measured blood pressure program in a community pharmacy: A pilot study. BACKGROUND Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and is costing the health care system billions of dollars annually. A health program that combines education, empowerment, and monitoring has shown to improve clinical outcomes and decrease overall health care costs. OBJECTIVE To describe the implementation and effectiveness of a self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) program in a community pharmacy. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION An independent community pharmacy located within rural Southeast Missouri. On-site community pharmacists provide medication therapy management, adherence monitoring, immunizations, and reimbursed clinical services. PRACTICE INNOVATION Patients were eligible if they were older than 18 years of age and fell into one of the following categories: self-reported a new hypertension diagnosis, self-reported a desire to SMBP, were referred by a provider, or had a medication change within the 3 months before enrollment. The program consisted of 4 patient sessions. The first session obtained an initial blood pressure and provided patient education and behavior counseling. Follow-up sessions obtained average SMBP readings and reinforced previously learned concepts. EVALUATION METHODS Implementation was evaluated using time and patient satisfaction. Effectiveness was evaluated using number and type of clinical problems identified, BP measurements, and test scores. RESULTS A total of 20 patients enrolled and completed the study. The program took 63 minutes (SD ± 18) of staff time per patient for recruitment, sessions, reminder calls, and documentation. All patients received education and monitoring and 11 additional clinical problems were documented. Systolic BP decreased an average of 17 mm Hg (P = 0.002), and diastolic BP decreased an average of 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Patient confidence scores increased by 14%, and 7 more patients correctly answered the post-test knowledge question. All patients reported overall satisfaction with the program as ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied.""

BACKGROUND Antibiotic overuse at hospital discharge is common and harmful; however, methods to improve prescribing during care transitions have been understudied. We aimed to pilot a pharmacist-facilitated antibiotic timeout prior to discharge. METHODS From May 2019 to October 2019, we conducted a single-center, controlled pilot study of a pharmacist-facilitated antibiotic timeout prior to discharge. The timeout addressed key elements of stewardship (e.g., duration) and was designed and implemented using iterative cycles with rapid feedback. We evaluated implementation outcomes related to feasibility, including usability, adherence, and acceptability, using mixed methods. Pre vs. post intervention antibiotic use at discharge in intervention vs. control groups was assessed using logistic regression models controlling for patient characteristics. RESULTS Pharmacists conducted 288 antibiotic timeouts. Timeouts were feasible (mean 2.5 minutes per timeout) and acceptable (85% [40/48] of hospitalists believed timeouts improved prescribing). Pharmacists recommended an antibiotic change in 25% (73/288) of timeouts with 70% (51/73) of recommended changes accepted by hospitalists. Barriers to adherence included unanticipated and weekend discharges. Compared to control services, there were no differences in antibiotic use after discharge during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS A pharmacist-facilitated antibiotic timeout at discharge was feasible and holds promise as a method to improve antibiotic use at discharge.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE This meta-analysis aims to evaluate inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the Gulf region and determine the effect of pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes on reducing inappropriateness. METHOD Articles were searched, analysed, and quality assessed through the risk of bias (ROB) quality assessment tool to select articles with a low level of bias. In step 1, 515 articles were searched, in step 2, 2360 articles were searched, and ultimately 32 articles were included by critical analysis. Statistical analysis used to determine risk ratio and standard mean differences were calculated using Review manager 5.4; 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the fixed-effect model. The I2 statistic assessed heterogeneity. In statistical heterogeneity, subgroup and sensitivity analyses, a random effect model was performed. The α threshold was 0.05. The primary outcome was inappropriateness in antibiotic prescribing in the Gulf region and reduction of inappropriateness through AMS. RESULT Detailed review and analysis of 18 studies of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the Gulf region showed the risk of inappropriateness was 43 669/100 846=43.3% (pooled RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.32). Test with overall effect was 58.87; in the second step 28 AMS programmes led by pharmacists showed reduced inappropriateness in AMS with pharmacist versus pre-AMS without pharmacist (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.39).

302,34848550,"Dispensing and practice use patterns, facilitators and barriers for uptake of ulipristal acetate emergency contraception in British Columbia: a mixed-methods study. BACKGROUND Ulipristal acetate 30 mg became available as prescription-only emergency contraception in British Columbia, Canada, in September 2015, as an addition to over-the-counter levonorgestrel emergency contraception. In this study, we determined dispensing and practice use patterns for ulipristal acetate, as well as facilitators of and barriers to emergency contraception for physicians, pharmacists and patients in BC. METHODS In the quantitative component of this mixed-methods study, we examined ulipristal acetate use from September 2015 to December 2018 using a database that captures all outpatient prescription dispensations in BC (PharmaNet) and another capturing market sales numbers for all oral emergency contraception in BC (IQVIA). We analyzed the quantitative data descriptively. We conducted semistructured interviews from August to November 2019, exploring barriers and facilitators affecting the use of ulipristal acetate. We performed iterative qualitative data collection and thematic analysis guided by Michie's Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS Over the 3-year study period, 318 patients filled 368 prescriptions for ulipristal acetate. Use of this agent increased between 2015 and 2018. However, levonorgestrel use by sales (range 118 897-129 478 units/yr) was substantially higher than use of ulipristal acetate (range 128-389 units/yr). In the 39 interviews we conducted, from the perspectives of 12 patients, 12 community pharmacists, and 15 prescribers, we identified the following themes and respective theoretical domains as barriers to access: low awareness of ulipristal acetate (knowledge), beliefs and experiences related to shame and stigma (beliefs about consequences), and multiple health system barriers (reinforcement). INTERPRETATION Use of ulipristal acetate in BC was low compared with use of levonorgestrel emergency contraception; lack of knowledge, beliefs about consequences and health system barriers may be important impediments to expanding use of ulipristal acetate. These findings illuminate potential factors to explain low use of this agent and point to the need for additional strategies to support implementation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
303,34848960,"Content Validation of an Algorithm for the Assessment, Management and Monitoring of Drug-Induced QTc Prolongation in the Psychiatric Population. Background QTc interval (QTcI) prolongation leads to serious complications, making it a concern for clinicians. Assessing the risk of QTcI prolongation in the psychiatric population is important because they are exposed to multiple medications known to increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Aim The study aims to validate the content of an algorithm for the assessment, management and monitoring of drug-induced QTc prolongation in the psychiatric population. Methodology Qualitative semi-structured interviews of cardiologists, to gather information regarding their approach in assessing the risk of drug-induced QTc prolongation at the time of prescribing. After the interview, an orientation to the algorithm was provided with a link to a cross-sectional, anonymous survey. The online survey included quantitative and qualitative components to gather feedback on the relevance and appropriateness of each step in the algorithm. Results Interview responses were incorporated into 4 themes. Responses indicated a lack of a unified protocol when assessing QTcI prolongation, which supports the need of an algorithm that includes a verified risk scoring tool. Quantitative survey results showed a mean score ranging from 3.08 to 3.67 out of 4 for the appropriateness of the algorithm's steps, 3.08 to 3.58 for the safety and 3.17 to 3.75 for the reliability of references used. Additional analysis using the modified kappa and I-CVI statistical measures indicate high validity of contents and high degree of agreement between raters. As per the open-ended questions, cardiologists supported the implementation of the algorithm; however, they recommended simplification of the steps as they appear to be cumbersome. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the implementation of the algorithm after minor alterations can prove to be useful as a tool for the risk assessment of QTc prolongation. Further validation of the algorithm with mental health pharmacists and clinicians will be conducted as a separate phase of the study.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
304,34849047,"Substance Use in Pregnancy: Identifying Stigma and Improving Care.  This review examines the impact of stigma on pregnant people who use substances. Stigma towards people who use drugs is pervasive and negatively impacts the care of substance-using people by characterizing addiction as a weakness and fostering beliefs that undermine the personal resources needed to access treatment and recover from addiction, including self-efficacy, help seeking and belief that they deserve care. Stigma acts on multiple levels by blaming people for having a problem and then making it difficult for them to get help, but in spite of this, most pregnant people who use substances reduce or stop using when they learn they are pregnant. Language, beliefs about gender roles, and attitudes regarding fitness for parenting are social factors that can express and perpetuate stigma while facilitating punitive rather than therapeutic approaches. Because of stigmatizing attitudes that a person who uses substances is unfit to parent, pregnant people who use substances are at heightened risk of being screened for substance use, referred to child welfare services, and having their parental rights taken away; these outcomes are even more likely for people of color. Various treatment options can successfully support recovery in substance-using pregnant populations, but treatment is underutilized in all populations including pregnant people, and more knowledge is needed on how to sustain engagement in treatment and recovery activities. To combat stigma when working with substance-using pregnant people throughout the peripartum period, caregivers should utilize a trauma-informed approach that incorporates harm reduction and motivational interviewing with a focus on building trust, enhancing self-efficacy, and strengthening the personal skills and resources needed to optimize health of the parent-baby dyad.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

307,34849544,"From theory to bedside: Implementation of fluid stewardship in a medical ICU pharmacy practice. PURPOSE Intravenous fluids are the most commonly prescribed medication in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can have a negative impact on patient outcomes if not utilized properly. Fluid stewardship aims to heighten awareness and improve practice in fluid therapy. This report describes a practical construct for implementation of fluid stewardship services and characterizes the pharmacist's role in fluid stewardship practice. SUMMARY Fluid stewardship services were integrated into an adult medical ICU at a large community hospital. Data characterizing these services over a 2-year span are reported and categorized based on the 4 rights (right patient, right drug, right route, right dose) and the ROSE (rescue, optimization, stabilization, evacuation) model of fluid administration. The review encompassed 305 patients totaling 905 patient days for whom 2,597 pharmacist recommendations were made, 19% of which were related to fluid stewardship. This corresponded to an average of 1.52 fluid stewardship recommendations per patient. Within the construct of the 4 rights, 39% of recommendations were related to the right patient, 33% were related to the right route, 17% were related to the right drug, and 11% were related to the right dose. By the ROSE model, 1% of recommendations were related to the rescue phase, 3% were related to optimization, 79% were related to stabilization, and 17% were related to evacuation. CONCLUSION Implementation of fluid stewardship pharmacy services in a community hospital medical ICU is feasible. Integration of this practice contributed to 19% of pharmacy recommendations. The most common recommendations involved evaluation of the patient for the appropriateness of fluid therapy during the stabilization phase. The impact of fluid stewardship on patient outcomes needs to be explored.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

309,34849554,"Personality: A potentially untapped resource in the selection of postgraduate pharmacy residents. PURPOSE This study assessed whether personality testing of postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residency applicants was feasible and predicted important selection outcomes, including interview offers. METHODS Applicants to the PGY1 pharmacy residency program at a large academic medical center were invited to complete a 50-item online personality test based on the 5-factor model (ie, the ""Big Five""). Scores were sealed until after matching, at which point they were compared to screening, interview, and ranking and match outcomes. Endpoints of interest included the feasibility of the test (eg, time required for completion, completion rate) and whether personality predicted the odds of an interview offer. RESULTS The personality test was taken by 137 PGY1 applicants (69.5%) and required a median of 6.8 minutes to complete. Openness to experience was associated with decreased odds of an interview offer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.98), whereas conscientiousness and extraversion were associated with increased odds of an interview offer (conscientiousness: adjusted OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.55; extraversion: OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.31). When combined with traditional screening criteria (eg, awards, leadership positions), openness to experience and extraversion remained predictors of an interview offer (in the directions specified above), whereas conscientiousness did not. In an exploratory analysis of interviewees, agreeableness was a negative predictor of interview score. Personality did not predict screening scores or final ranking. CONCLUSION Personality testing, based on the traits desired at individual residency programs, could be a valuable addition to the methods used for selecting PGY1 pharmacy residents.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

311,34849708,"Perceptions of injectable therapies with cardiovascular benefit: an ACNAP survey of healthcare professionals to explore facilitators and barriers. AIMS Injectable medicines are increasingly used to manage risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) events, such as dyslipidaemia and diabetes. These include proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Little is known about perceptions of injectable therapies among CV healthcare professionals (HCPs). This study explores their views to identify relevant facilitators and barriers to the use of injectables with CV benefit. METHODS AND RESULTS A 22-question survey was distributed internationally via online channels. In total, 192 anonymous responses were received (43.7% physicians, 32.6% nurses, 16.8% pharmacists, 6.8% others). Among respondents with experience of these medicines, 69.1% had used an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor and 67.0% had used an injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist. Commonly raised issues were resource problems (36.5%), lack of knowledge among colleagues (32.3%), paperwork (32.3%), and lack of patient knowledge (28.1%). Key barriers respondents felt made patients decline these treatments were fear of injection (56.6%), lack of awareness or education (26.4%), and administration issues (15.1%); potential reasons for discontinuation included side effects (46.4%), perceived lack of benefit (28.6%), and local reactions (21.4%). The main topics around injectables requiring further support included managing non-adherent patients (16.2%), troubleshooting with patients (16.2%), and educating colleagues about injectables (12.2%). Preferred educational methods to support HCPs were face-to-face training (43.5%) and online learning (26.1%); favoured formats were based on role playing and case studies. CONCLUSION Healthcare professionals highlighted various potential barriers to initiation, continuation, and adherence with injectable therapies in CV medicine. Although some require healthcare system changes, many could be addressed through simple measures based primarily on enhanced training and support for patients and HCPs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Dengue is considered to be the most important arbovirus worldwide, with important complications that increase its lethality. In Brazil, an endemic country, the disease reaches significant incidence levels, with occurrences of serious cases and high costs of hospitalizations for its treatment. OBJECTIVE To analyze risk factors among individuals with recent histories of dengue infection in a medium-sized city in Mato Grosso. DESIGN AND SETTING Descriptive cross-sectional study, of epidemiological-survey type, conducted among the urban population of a city located in mid-northern Mato Grosso. METHODS A seroepidemiological survey using questionnaires and collection of biological material was conducted among 596 adults aged ≥ 18 years who had been selected through a cluster sampling process. Positive dengue cases were those with positive results from anti-dengue immunoassays (ELISA). Statistical analyses with descriptive and inferential techniques were used, with 95% confidence intervals and a 5% significance level. RESULTS The seroepidemiological profile of the study participants was predominantly female, with ages between 18 and 39 years, self-declared non-white race/color, not more than eight years of education and not living with a companion. Among the sanitary factors analyzed, the following were risk factors for dengue virus infection: no running water at home; no water supply from the public piped network; no waste from drains or toilets sent to the sewage network; endemic disease combat agents visiting the home; and presence of mosquito breeding sites at home.

315,34852882,"Antimicrobial stewardship in the Western Cape: A situational analysis of existing facility-level initiatives. BACKGROUND Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing problem worldwide. With the current occurrence of pan-resistant bacterial infections and a paucity of novel antimicrobials in development, the world has entered a post-antibiotic era, in which previously treatable, common infections can become fatal. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), defined as 'co-ordinated interventions to ensure appropriate and rational use of antimicrobials', aims to decrease rates of AMR. OBJECTIVES To co-ordinate AMS in Western Cape Province. The National Department of Health (NDoH) has identified AMS as a key strategic objective, and the Western Cape has formed a provincial AMS committee. However, not much is known regarding current AMS activities in health facilities in the province. METHODS A self-administered, email questionnaire was sent to specific staff at all district, regional and tertiary hospitals in the 6 health districts of the Western Cape - 47 facilities in total, of which 35 (74.4%) responded. Respondents included pharmacists, managers, doctors, nurses, infection prevention and control practitioners, as well as quality assurance practitioners. The number of facilities implementing AMS were determined, as well as the composition of AMS committees and the nature and frequency of team activities. Barriers to facility-level AMS were explored. Support and outreach activities were assessed, as well as facilities' needs and expectations of the provincial AMS committee. RESULTS Approximately half of all responding hospitals (n=19; 54.3%) had active AMS committees. Double the proportion of metropolitan (83.3%) than rural facilities (39.1%) had committees. Stewardship activities included antimicrobial prescription chart reviews and audits, AMS ward rounds, antimicrobial restriction policies and training. Most committees included a pharmacist and an infection prevention and control practitioner. More than a third of hospitals (36.1%) did not review their antimicrobial consumption data on a regular basis. Just over half of the hospitals (n=18; 51.4%) did not review AMR patterns. CONCLUSIONS Despite the need for effective AMS, there is limited information on AMS in South Africa. Most assistance is required in rural areas and smaller hospitals with low numbers of staff and greater numbers of transient rotating junior staff. Information management support, multidisciplinary teamwork and clinical governance are required to enable regular and ongoing AMS in facilities. Rural and smaller facilities require greater support to establish effectively functioning AMS committees.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of self-administration of medicines (facilitated by a midwife formulary) on postnatal women's knowledge of certain post-delivery medications, awareness of the Green Bag Scheme, factors contributing to constipation, pain satisfaction, adherence, and time released to midwives plus feedback from these women and their midwives. METHODS The study was conducted in consented postnatal women, who self-administered medications from their bedside lockers. The mode of delivery and parity were recorded. Data were compared in women who self-administered to those who did not. Midwives used our established midwife formulary to write their essential unprescribed medications. Direct interview questionnaires were used to obtain their knowledge on chosen post-delivery medicines, pain satisfaction, the Green Bag Scheme and factors contributing to constipation. Regular medicines counts were used to check adherence. Midwives' time not administering these self-administered medications was estimated. Self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain feedback from participants and midwives. Responses were analysed proportionately and where appropriate by simple statistics. RESULTS Women (n=203) who self-administered were compared with those (n=401) who did not. Greater medicines' knowledge and better (96% vs 79%) pain satisfaction were found in self-administering women. Knowledge of each contributing factor to constipation varied. Mode of delivery and parity had no impact on these outcomes. Adherence seemed high 96% (195/203). Awareness of the Green Bag Scheme was poor (66/604). Most women, 94% (191/203) found the service helpful and 89% (178/200) would take part again. At least 224 hours were released to midwives by these self-administering women. 164/203 (81%) midwives felt the scheme was beneficial. CONCLUSIONS Self-administering women had better pain satisfaction, medication knowledge and adherence. The need to improve engagement in the Green Bag Scheme was flagged. This service, supported by use of a midwife formulary, can release time to midwives to do other tasks including care for women with more complex issues.

On the other hand, in clinical practice, clinical-pharmacometrics can be used for optimized management of individual patients of pharmaceutical products. Therefore, we aimed at individual optimization of infectious disease treatment for antimicrobial resistant bacteria, and tried a series of flows from model construction to clinical application, that is, practice of clinical pharmacometrics. In the context of individual optimization and optimization management of drug therapy in the medical field, it is considered that hospital pharmacists can contribute to the improvement of infectious disease treatment of antimicrobial resistance bacteria by contributing to the optimization of administration method. In addition, clinical pharmacometrics can be applied not only to antibacterial drugs but also to all drugs, and can be said to be a useful method for quantitatively evaluating the promotion of individualized administration methods for patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
318,34853209,"[Acute Drug Poisoning among Adolescents Using Over-the-counter Drugs: Current Status].  We discuss the current status of, and possible countermeasures for, acute drug poisoning among adolescents using OTC drugs. In the last 10 years, 36 patients aged <20 years who overdosed on OTC drugs were examined for the type of drug ingested, its active ingredients in cases of lethal dose intake, and the relevant place of purchase. Patients aged <20 years accounted for 30% of all the cases. The ingestion of multi-ingredient common-cold medication was the highest at 23%, and no ingestion of any first-class OTC drugs was observed. Caffeine accounted for 54% of the cases of lethal dose intake. At 80%, the most common method of drug purchase was from drugstores and other OTC vendors. In recent years, the number of adolescents patients who take lethal doses of OTC drugs has been increasing, and new measures are needed to avoid such cases. School pharmacists and vendors play a major role in reducing the incidences of drug poisoning. As drugs can be easily purchased over the counter, increasing the vendors' awareness of the problem throughout society may be the quickest way to reduce the incidences of acute drug poisoning among adolescents.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
319,34853544,"Perceived Stress and Quality of Life Among Final-Year Pharmacy Students in the United Arab Emirates During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown. Background Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused huge disruptions worldwide affecting most people including university students. The impact of the pandemic lockdown on pharmacy students' stress levels and quality of life (QoL) is not well studied. This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived stress levels and QoL among final-year undergraduate pharmacy students at Ajman University, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods A cross-sectional electronic survey was conducted among final-year Bachelor of Pharmacy students at Ajman University during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The perceived stress scale and World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) were administered through Google Forms. The filled responses were exported to IBM SPSS statistics, Version 26, scored as per the standard scoring procedures, and analyzed to answer the study objectives. Since the data were not distributed normally (p=0.000, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test) were performed to compare the median (IQR) scores with demographic parameters at an alpha value of 0.05. Results Of the eligible 94 students, 81 (male=16, 19.8%, female = 65, 80.2%) responded. The perceived stress level due to COVID-19 among the participants of a score of 24 suggests that the students suffered a ""moderate"" level of stress with no statistical significance between genders regardless of the place of residence in the seven Emirates (p=0.371) of the UAE. During the previous month of conducting the survey, 40.7% (n=33) of the respondents ""very often"" felt nervous and 22% (n=18) ""fairly often"" felt nervous with a median (IQR) score 3 (2-4); 3 denotes 'sometimes'. Of the respondents, 6.2% (n=14) ""very often"" and 21% (n=17) ""fairly often"" felt that things were going their own way. Regarding the QoL statements, a median (IQR) score of 3 (3-4) was obtained for the question on ""How much do you enjoy life?"", and the median scores were ""4 (very much)"" for more than half of the statements overall denoting a better QoL. The study reported females to have more physical pain, which may prevent them from carrying out their daily activities, than males (p=0.001) reflecting a better QoL among males over females during the lockdown. It also reflects a higher need for medications among females compared to males (p=0.014). All participants showed negative feelings, which is more apparent among male participants (4, 3-4.5) when compared to female participants (3, 2-3) (P = 0.001). Conclusion The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived stress and self-reported QoL is minimum. Age, gender and other demographic factors had little or no effect on stress levels, but gender influenced ""experience of physical pain"" and ""requirement for medications"", with more likelihood in females. Student friendly educational approaches and proper implementation of educational reforms can help minimizing student stress and improving QoL during vulnerable times like lockdowns.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
320,34855176,"Levels and risks of surface contamination by thirteen antineoplastic drugs in the Czech and Slovak hospitals and pharmacies.  The consumption of hazardous antineoplastic drugs (ADs) used in anticancer chemotherapies is steadily increasing representing thus risks to both human health and the environment. Hospitals may serve as a contamination source, and pharmacists preparing the antineoplastic drugs (ADs) as well as nurses administering chemotherapy and caring for oncology patients are among the healthcare professionals being highly exposed. Here, we present the results of systematic monitoring (2018-2020) of surface contamination by 13 ADs in the pharmacies and hospitals in the Czech Republic (CZ; large-scale monitoring, 20 workplaces) and Slovak Republic (SK; pilot study at 4 workplaces). The study evaluated contamination by three commonly monitored ADs, i.e., 5-fluorouracil (FU), cyclophosphamide (CP), and platinum (total Pt representing cis-, carbo-, and oxaliplatin) together with ten less explored ADs, i.e., gemcitabine (GEM), ifosfamide (IF), paclitaxel (PX), irinotecan (IRI), docetaxel (DOC), methotrexate (MET), etoposide (ETOP), capecitabine (CAP), imatinib (IMAT), and doxorubicin (DOX). Floors and desktop surfaces in hospitals (chemotherapy application rooms, nurse working areas) were found to be more contaminated, namely with CP and Pt, in both countries when compared to pharmacies. Comparison between the countries showed that hospital surfaces in SK are generally more contaminated (e.g., CP median was 20 times higher in SK), while some pharmacy areas in the CZ were more contamined in comparison with SK. The newly studied ADs were detected at lower concentrations in comparison to FU, CP, and Pt, but some markers (GEM, IF, PX, and IRI) were frequently observed, and adding these compounds to routine monitoring is recommended.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
321,34855578,"Digital transformation of the mobile connected pharmacy: a first step toward community pharmacy 5.0.  Community pharmacies have made significant advances in digital technology; however, mobile systems are only emerging in this sector and mostly focusing patient-centric connections. This study reveals a case of digital transformation in a mobile connected pharmacy, balancing efficient pharmaceutical services and digital innovation. A mobile connected pharmacy solution (mPharmaCare) is developed for a community of near 100.000. The first stage includes a bibliometric analysis and a structured literature review of the mobile connected pharmacy. In the second stage, action research was conducted to evaluate mPharmaCare adoption. A dual organizational structure was tested to cope with innovation and efficient exploration of pharmacy services. Community Pharmacy 5.0 is an inspiring vision that will take advantage of mobility. However, there are tensions between the core pharmacy business and the new technology layers of community connections. Community pharmacies require both client-centric and community-centric approaches to achieve individualization of patient care and horizontal and end-to-end digital integration of pharmacy data. Digital transformation can remove silos in the community pharmacy. Creating an - internal or outsourced - innovation division may be suitable for medium and large community pharmacies. Moreover, pharmacies must consider shifting to a product-service system offer, deploying synchronization mechanisms with different stakeholders.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Ghana has a generalized HIV epidemic and efforts have been made to curb the spread and reverse its effects on the general population. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the health system was unsettled and antiretroviral therapy (ART) care has been impacted in diverse ways. The study sought to explore the effects of COVID-19 on ART service provision in Ghana from the perspectives of the healthcare workers. METHODS An exploratory-descriptive qualitative approach was employed in this study. Using maximum variation sampling method, fifteen healthcare workers; nurses, data managers and pharmacists were recruited from an ART clinic in a Teaching Hospital in Ghana. In-depth interviews were conducted and analysed using Braun and Clarke thematic approach. RESULTS Three themes emerged from the data; ""… And the pandemic struck"", ""Impact of the pandemic on ART service delivery""; ""Effecting the needed change"". The healthcare workers' initial reactions to the pandemic and their show of commitment in ensuring continued ART service was evident. COVID-19 impacted service delivery in three main ways; (1) clients' clinic attendance was erratic at various stages of the pandemic, (2) irregular resource availability as shortage was reported due to affected last mile delivery as a result of the lockdown in Accra, and (3) the health worker-patient interaction became less engaging because of established COVID-19 protocols. The healthcare workers however instituted strategies such as adjusting the patient appointment schedule, health professionals' work schedule, establishing several work stations, task-shifting, and ensuring the implementation of all the COVID-19 protocols within the ART unit to ensure consistent service delivery as well as patient and staff safety. The study also found a decline in the implementation of several strategies established in the ART clinic during the initial phases of the pandemic such as a decline in the supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) by hospital management. CONCLUSIONS Although several strategies were implemented to manage the effects of the pandemic on ART care, there is a need to establish pathways of support for healthcare workers within the ART clinic and to consolidate as well as institutionalise the changes that ensured continuous but safe service delivery.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

324,34857043,"Pharmacists' perceptions and attitudes toward drug importation into the State of Florida. BACKGROUND The Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration released the Safe Importation Action Plan in July 2020 detailing methods to import medicines from Canada to combat increasing drug costs. In November 2020, Florida became the first state in the United States to create and propose an importation plan from Canada. This study examines the proposal submitted by Florida, Florida pharmacists' perceptions of the program on patient safety, and Florida pharmacists' thoughts on the pharmacy operational impact. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study utilizing an electronic questionnaire sent to pharmacist members of the Florida Pharmacy Association. The survey incorporated closed-ended and open-ended questions. The results from the study were reported and analyzed through descriptive statistics, qualitative and quantitative data. RESULTS Two-hundred and forty-four pharmacists responded to the survey. Of those respondents, 25% stated they had no knowledge about Florida's drug importation plan. Less than 12% of respondents stated they would trust the safety and quality of imported medicines. Seventy percent of pharmacists expressed concerns regarding the changes required in pharmacy operations to increase medicine safety. About half of the respondents questioned whether this plan would promote cost-savings as intended. CONCLUSION Florida pharmacists believe the drug importation plan does not address all aspects of patient and medicine safety and expressed concerns regarding logistical operations of a pharmacy.

325,34857056,"Knowledge and perceptions of pharmacists' readiness during coronavirus pandemic: the case of United Arab Emirates. BACKGROUND With the outbreak of Coronavirus infection (COVID-19), pharmacists play an important role in supporting local health during this emergency. AIM To assess the knowledge and to identify information sources regarding COVID-19 used by pharmacists, to investigate the active and public perceived roles of pharmacists, to explore the role of the pharmacy facilities and health authorities, and to identify barriers that would hinder pharmacists from performing their duties optimally in the United Arab Emirates. METHODS This descriptive cross-sectional online study was conducted in the UAE during the COVID-19 outbreak, from 18 May to 20 June 2020. A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current knowledge about pandemics and COVID-19, source of information, and their perspectives of their role was used. Participants were licensed pharmacists practising in community and hospital pharmacies in UAE, academics, and pharmacy students. RESULTS Almost two-thirds of the participants (71.2%) were aged 18-30 years, with 76.2% females. Only 57.5% of participants believed that they got enough education about pandemics, and 88.3% of them followed on the latest coronavirus updates regarding treatments, and that is mainly from the World Health Organization reports (53.9%), followed by health authorities (44.8%). Two-thirds of participants (69.7%) had good/very good current knowledge regarding COVID-19. Knowledge of pharmacy students compared to pharmacists was significantly higher (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in managing pandemics executed through the community pharmacies and that it is their role to ensure the availability of key medications. Policymakers and health authorities are called upon to train pharmacists in advance of emerging situations, supporting and helping them to optimally fulfill their role.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
326,34857481,"Addressing cultural competence and bias in treating migrant workers in pharmacies: Pharmacy students learning and changing norms. OBJECTIVE Little research addressed training pharmacy students on bias towards vulnerable patients such as migrant domestic workers (MDWs). This study evaluates a module addressing bias and cultural competence when working with MDWs in community pharmacies. METHODS Two cohorts of Lebanese Bachelor of pharmacy students completed this module as part of a core Public Health class. Guided by a social psychology framework, the module involved watching a lecture, discussing an article, watching a video addressing bias in healthcare, and taking an Implicit Association Test. Second, students interviewed one MDW and one pharmacist before filling a reflection worksheet. Students' reflections were analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Further, to evaluate the module's impact quantitatively, an aggregate perception of helpfulness scale was created and validated. Items addressed students' own experience with the module as well as its impact on pharmacists interviewed by students. RESULTS Of 170 students completing the module and providing qualitative data, 131 were asked to fill a survey addressing perceptions of assignment helpfulness. Of those 131 students, 126 filled the survey. On a scale ranging from zero to four, the composite mean score for helpfulness was 3.4, SD = 0.5. Students reported a positive impact of the interview in improving awareness of bias for pharmacists they interviewed (mean = 3.5, SD = 0.6). Qualitative analysis produced insight into students' experience with the module including challenges in communication with MDWs; MDWs' experience with bias and its repercussions; predictability, or lack thereof, of assignment results; plans to address bias after taking the module; evaluation of interviewed pharmacist's service; and perceived pharmacists' impressions of the assignment. CONCLUSIONS A two-part module shows promise in educating pharmacy students about bias and cultural competence.

327,34857482,"A patient-reported experience measure for community pharmacy including development of a short-form: The perceived service quality scale. BACKGROUND The perceived service quality scale (pSQS) is a patient-reported experience measure (PREM) previously developed for measuring perceived service quality (pSQ) in community pharmacies. While measuring pSQ is feasible, further psychometric evaluation of the pSQS is warranted. In addition, the length of the 20-item pSQS may lead to fatigue among patients. It remains to be determined whether a short form of the pSQS has acceptable psychometric properties. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to psychometrically test the pSQS with a specific focus on making scoring recommendations and developing a short form pSQS with acceptable psychometric properties. METHODS Participants were recruited either in community pharmacies or via an online panel to complete a questionnaire including the pSQS. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted using robust statistics, including tests of factorial invariance. Alternative models were tested including a bifactor model. Spearman's correlation was used to conduct test-retest analyses on responses obtained one month apart. RESULTS Data were analysed from 319 participants recruited in-store and 303 participants recruited online, 86 participants providing test-retest reliability. Tests of factorial invariance indicated that the pSQS is stable across settings. The most parsimonious and best-fitting solution was obtained with a 19-item bifactor model with 5 factors plus a ""general"" factor. Factor scores obtained from the ""general"" factor explained sufficient variance and are unlikely to be excessively biased in regression models. A short-form 6-item scale (pSQ-SF6) demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and similar predictive capacity to the original pSQS for patient loyalty intentions. Test-retest analyses indicated acceptable reliability for pSQS and PSQ-SF6. CONCLUSION This study confirms that the pSQS has acceptable psychometric properties including temporal stability. It is recommended that a 19-item pSQS be used to obtain a comprehensive overview of patients' pSQ. The short-form pSQ-SF6 is suitable as a community pharmacy PREM.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

329,34857531,"Pass the SOAP: Shifting from SOAP to Consult Notes for Clinical Documentation in Pharmacy Students.  Objective. Clinical documentation is an important element of patient care that pharmacy students traditionally learn through Subjective-Objective-Assessment-Plan (SOAP) notes. In clinical practice, pharmacists often document more succinctly both in regard to length and time; utilizing formats such as consult notes. The objective of this study was to assess consult note assignments for third-year pharmacy students (P3).Methods. Consult note assignments were implemented in a P3 skills laboratory course by converting SOAP notes to consult notes. The series began with an introduction and a practice consult note. Four graded notes were then completed throughout the semester with time allotted for writing decreasing throughout the semester. To assess the series, grades and estimated time for completion were collected for each graded note. A pre-post survey assessed student self-confidence in: 1) overall documentation, 2) specific elements of consult notes, and 3) concerns related to writing. Friedman's tests were utilized to compare grades and time. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to compare self-assessments.Results. Median consult note grades were: 92%, 88%, 80%, and 90% for each note. Median time for completion were: 75 minutes, 120 minutes, 60 minutes, and 60 minutes. Student self-confidence in writing consult notes significantly increased as did five of the six individual elements.Conclusion. The consult note assignments allowed students to practice documenting patient care in a succinct format with consideration for time efficiency.

In 2014, Google introduced the snippet block to programmatically search available websites to answer a question entered into the search engine without the need for the user to enter any websites. This study compared the accuracy and completeness of drug information found in Google snippet blocks to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medication guides. Methods Ten outpatient drugs were selected from the 2018 Clinical Drugstats Database Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Six questions in the medication guide for each drug were entered into the Google search engine to find the snippet block. The accuracy and completeness of drug information in the Google snippet block were quantified by two different pharmacists using a scoring system of 1 (less than 25% accurate/complete information) to 5 (100% accurate/complete information). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the scores. Results For five out of the six questions, the information in the Google snippets had less than 50% accuracy and completeness compared to the medication guides. The average accuracy and completeness scores of the Google snippets were highest for ""What are the ingredients of [the drug]?"" with scores of 3.38 (51-75%) and 3.00 (51-75%), respectively. The question on ""How to take [drug]?"" had the lowest score with averages of 1.00 (<25%) for both accuracy and completeness.

334,34858100,"Video killed the multiple-choice quiz: capturing pharmacy students' literature searching skills using a screencast video assignment. Background In a flipped, required first-year drug information course, students were taught the systematic approach to answering drug information questions, commonly utilized resources, and literature searching. As co-coordinator, a librarian taught three weeks of the course focused on mobile applications, development of literature searching skills, and practicing in PubMed. Course assignments were redesigned in 2019 based on assessment best practices and replaced weekly multiple-choice quizzes used in prior iterations of the course. Case Presentation Following two weeks of literature searching instruction, students were assigned a drug information question that would serve as the impetus for the search they conducted. Students (n=66) had one week to practice and record a screencast video of their search in PubMed. Students narrated their video with an explanation of the actions being performed and were assessed using a twenty-point rubric created by the course coordinator and librarian. The librarian also created general feedback videos for each question by recording screencasts while performing the literature searches and clarifying troublesome aspects for students. The librarian spent about twenty-four hours grading and six hours writing scripts, recording, and editing feedback videos. Conclusion Most students performed well on the assignment and few experienced technical difficulties. Instructors will use this assignment and feedback method in the future. Screencast videos proved an innovative way to assess student knowledge and to provide feedback on literature searching assignments.

335,34859478,"Opioid misuse in community pharmacy patients with chronic non-cancer pain. AIMS Community pharmacists could contribute to identify people misusing prescription opioids, which may be associated with hospitalizations, substance use disorders, and death. This study investigated prescription opioid misuse in community pharmacy patients and the factors potentially associated with high Prescription Opioid Misuse Index (POMI) scores. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, pharmacy students asked patients with opioids prescriptions to fill in a questionnaire (including the POMI) in community pharmacies in a French region, in April 2019. Eligible patients were adults with chronic non-cancer pain who consented to participate. RESULTS In total, 414 patients (62.4% of women; mean age: 58.00 years ± 16.00) were included. The prescribed opioids were mainly weak opioids (73.2%; paracetamol/tramadol: 35%). Strong opioids (32.6%) included oxycodone (11.95%), fentanyl (9%), and morphine (9%). The median morphine milligram equivalent (MME) was 40 mg/day [IQR25-75 : 20-80]. The POMI score (0 to 6) was ≥4 in 16% of patients who were younger (p<0.01), more urban (p=0.03), with higher pain visual analogue scale (VAS) score (p<0.01) and MME (p<0.01), and treated more frequently with strong opioids (p=0.04). In multivariate analysis, age (ORfor 10y : 0.68 [95%CI: 0.56-0.82, p<0.0001]), VAS (OR2units : 1.78 [95%CI: 1.26-2.40, p=0.0008]), and MME (>100 mg, OR: 2.65 [95%CI: 1.14-4.41, p=0.0194) were significantly associated with POMI scores ≥4.

OBJECTIVES Over-the-counter emergency contraception (EC) purchase was legalised in Italy in 2015. Knowledge and access gaps, however, remain. The goal of this study was to explore women's and men's EC informational and access needs. METHODS As part of a larger reproductive study, researchers conducted 42 in-depth interviews (May-June 2019) with English-speaking women and men aged 18-50 years (mean ± standard deviation, 29.1 ± 7.9 years) living in or near Florence, Italy, and using the Italian health care system. Researchers completed qualitative data analysis to identify emergent themes related to EC knowledge, attitudes and access. HyperRESEARCH aided data organisation and analysis. Researchers used a comparative method to contextualise data and identify emergent themes. RESULTS Findings demonstrated that peer communication and experiences served as influential factors in others' EC use. This propagated misinformation, reducing participants' confidence in EC efficacy and safety. Women described the relevance of relationship type in whether to engage men in EC discussion, while men desired an active supportive role.

Outcomes were related to health care utilization, patient outcomes, and medication changes; however, results were difficult to compare because of heterogeneous outcomes within the topics. Overall, results were either positive or neutral. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The evidence for deprescribing during the preoperative period for older adults undergoing surgery is weak because of the heterogeneity of intervention delivery and outcomes, inclusion of nonoperative cases in some studies, and low power. This review highlights the need for future research, which may consider the following: (1) interdisciplinary approach, (2) coordination of deprescribing efforts with primary care provider from the waiting period for surgery up to after discharge, and (3) validated deprescribing criteria such as STOPP/START that is easy to implement. It is important to note that results yielded positive and neutral results, not negative ones, which should reassure clinicians to implement deprescribing for older adults during the surgical period. Additionally, policy initiatives such as integrated electronic medical records or increased reimbursement of deprescribing efforts for primary care providers and/or hospitals should be pursued to prevent adverse postoperative events for this population.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,Geriatric,Geriatric,,,Other,Other,,
339,34861765,"Factors associated with retention and adherence in a comprehensive, diverse HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) clinic. INTRODUCTION Retention in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care and adherence to PrEP has been suboptimal in some populations, despite evidence that high adherence dramatically enhances PrEP efficacy. A comprehensive PrEP Clinic with a retention specialist and clinical pharmacist could impact patient's retention and adherence in PrEP care. METHODS A retrospective electronic medical record review of patients attending an academic PrEP Clinic was conducted between 6/2018 to 6/2019 (at least one visit attended for PrEP was required). Retention was defined as a medical or lab visit every three months +/- 30 days, as recommended by CDC guidelines, but was analyzed using the number of visits and time between visits via multivariate regression analyses. PrEP adherence was calculated using a Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and compared between patient characteristics using Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS 122 patients were identified by chart review, 96 had sufficient data for follow-up and were included in at least one analysis. The population was primarily cisgender MSM and over half were African American or Hispanic. Overall, patient retention was 43%. The retention analysis demonstrated that individuals who self-identified as gay were more likely to be retained than those who identified as heterosexual (53% vs. 18%, Hazard Ratio = 1.75, 95% C.I. = [1.01, 3.03], p = 0.045). Though not statistically significant, African Americans and cisgender women were less likely to be retained in care. The adherence analysis identified higher median MPRs among patients not reporting previous incarceration (80% vs. 35%, p < 0.01). Though not statistically significant, there was lower adherence among youth 18-24 (11% vs. 54% MPR>80, p=0.058). Discussion & Conclusions: Despite comprehensive PrEP clinical care, heterosexual individuals were less likely to be retained in PrEP care than those who self-identified as gay and previously incarcerated individuals were less likely to be adherent to PrEP.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
340,34861836,"Association between impulsivity and orthorexia nervosa / healthy orthorexia: any mediating effect of depression, anxiety, and stress? BACKGROUND There is a lack of studies investigating the possible mediating role of psychological factors, such as depression, anxiety and stress on orthorexic eating behaviors. Given that personality attributes might affect the manifestation of psychological disorders, it was hypothesized that depression, anxiety and stress mediate the relationship between impulsivity-related traits and orthorexic eating, noting that previous research had evaluated the role of depression as a mediator between impulsivity and other pathological eating behaviors. The study objectives were to explore the mediating effect of depression, anxiety, and stress, on impulsivity and orthorexia nervosa, and healthy orthorexia. METHODS This cross-sectional study conducted between July and December 2019 recruited 519 Lebanese adults from seven community pharmacies randomly selected from a list provided by the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists. RESULTS Our results showed that depression and anxiety were positively correlated with ON. We also found a notable gender difference in findings: higher anxiety and female gender were significantly associated with higher TOS healthy orthorexia, while higher stress was associated with lower TOS healthy orthorexia. Finally, higher urgency was associated with lower TOS healthy orthorexia, while higher perseverance was significantly associated with higher TOS healthy orthorexia. Depression and anxiety partially mediated the association between perseverance and ON while anxiety and stress partially mediated the association between urgency and healthy orthorexia. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that depression, anxiety and stress play a mediating role between impulsivity and orthorexia nervosa/healthy orthorexia. Our findings provide a ground for future investigations of impulsive behaviors, psychopathology, and orthorexia in different populations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

344,34861908,"Admissions and Mortality Related to Urinary Tract Infections in Male Veterans with Dementia.  Objective To examine mortality and hospital readmission rates in male veterans with dementia diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) compared with patients without dementia. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Veterans Healthcare Systems (VA). Participants Male inpatients with a diagnosis of UTI who were treated at any VA Healthcare Center from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018. Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures Mortality and hospital readmission for patients with and without dementia at 30, 60, and 90 days from UTI diagnosis. Results 262,515 veterans admitted with UTI were analyzed, and 58,940 (22.5%) had dementia. The mean age for veterans with dementia was 80.0 +/- 9.7 years. Veterans with dementia experienced less mortality than patients without dementia at 30 days (8.3% vs 8.5%; P < 0.001), but more mortality at 60-day (4.9% vs 4.7%; P < 0.001) and 90-day (3.6% vs 3.3%; P < 0.001) intervals. Death was 20% less likely at 30 days in patients with dementia. Veterans with dementia were readmitted more than those without dementia at 30-day (18.4% vs 16.0%), 60-day (4.5% vs 2.8%), and 90-day (3.4% vs 2.5%) intervals; P < 0.0001. Conclusion Though patients with dementia are at an increased risk for death long-term, risk of death is less than those without dementia shortly following UTI diagnosis. This highlights the possibility that veterans with dementia may be hospitalized and diagnosed with UTIs when in actuality they have asymptomatic bacteriuria. Patients with dementia and UTI therefore represent an important group of geriatric patients that could benefit from the oversight of a senior care pharmacist to help prevent unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
345,34862142,"Perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines in a predominantly Hispanic patient population from the Texas-Mexico border. BACKGROUND Compared with nationwide averages, Hispanic individuals have experienced lower routine vaccination rates and have been disproportionately hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Few, if any, studies have examined the health beliefs surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines and adult vaccines among this population. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to (1) describe perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines in a predominantly Hispanic patient population in a federally qualified health center (FQHC) situated on the United States-Mexico border and (2) compare patient confidence in recommendations made by local clinic and government to obtain adult and COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS A bilingual (English or Spanish) written survey was administered to participants recruited from a convenience sample of patients in waiting areas of 4 clinic sites in an FQHC system on the Texas-Mexico border between March and May 2021. Survey items were derived from the Health Belief Model and captured beliefs surrounding perceived effectiveness, perceived harms, protection from the influenza vaccine, trust in the local clinic, and trust in the government. RESULTS A total of 58 participants aged 19-90 years, with a mean age of 57.28 years, completed the survey between March and May 2021, with 77.6% of respondents indicating they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves. Results revealed a trend among older adults in the study cohort to be more likely to trust the government in recommending vaccines than younger adults (r = 0.33, P ≤ 0.05) and a tendency toward higher vaccine acceptance among male survey participants (P = 0.026). The highest correlation that emerged was between perceived trust in local clinic provider and the perceived effectiveness of vaccines (r = 0.74, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Trends related to perceptions of adult vaccines among Hispanic patients extend to the COVID-19 vaccines: especially trust in local clinic providers. Increased age may correlate to higher trust in a government-recommended vaccine. Results highlight the importance of the pharmacist giving the patient a clear recommendation to receive vaccination and strong local clinic messaging.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
346,34862164,"Perspectives of pharmacists in general practice from qualitative focus groups with patients during a pilot study. BACKGROUND Utilising skill mix in general practice is proposed as a solution to the demand-supply issue. Pharmacists can play an important role in this context leading to an increase in training and funding for independent prescriber roles. A role for Pharmacists in General Practice was funded, piloted and evaluated by NHSE from 2015. AIM What is the patient perspective of pharmacists in patient facing roles in general practice in the UK? DESIGN & SETTING Focus group interviews exploring patient perspectives on the pharmacist role. METHOD 33 patients, five focus group interviews (January-December 2016). Data was iteratively analysed using the one sheet of paper technique. RESULTS While public are aware of the primary care crisis, they are less well informed about potential solutions. Data showed patients primarily sought access to a clinician over expressing a preference for any type of clinician. Low awareness was shown about the role and there was initial confusion about pharmacist's roles. Acceptability levels were high.Pharmacists add value and provide an expert medication focused service which can have a positive impact on medicines use.Patients reported benefit from longer appointments, feeling they weren't rushed, and that all their conditions were being considered holistically. They trusted pharmacists as experts in medication and trust was consolidated over time. Regular coaching from a pharmacist could lead to improved patient self-monitoring and self-care.

347,34862176,"Examining Social Identities of Patient Diversity Through Cases Presented in a Therapeutics Course Series.  Objective. The inclusion of social identities, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, spirituality, nationality, and socioeconomic status, within cases in didactic pharmacy education is an issue of significant debate. In considering what and how much to include of these identities into didactic cases, the first step could be to measure the current inclusion. The purpose of this study was to quantify the presence of these social identities in cases presented to student pharmacists in a three-semester course series.Methods. This was a review of 144 cases presented in a three-semester pharmacotherapeutics course series. The primary objective was to quantify the inclusion of each social identity. The secondary objective assessed if the identities were needed to answer specific questions related to each case. Cases were reviewed by two independent study researchers, with a third impartial reviewer settling disagreements.Results. Explicitly stating these identities was infrequent among the cases. Race was explicitly stated in 14.6% of cases (n=21). Gender identity was explicitly named in 2 cases (1.4%), whereas nearly all cases implied gender through pronouns. Gender was necessary to answer case questions in approximately 20% of the cases (n=27). Socioeconomic status, ability, sexual orientation, and nationality were infrequently named among all cases, 6.3%, 4.9%, 1.4%, and 1.4%, respectively.Conclusion. This study found that these social identities were rarely explicitly stated in cases.

Interprofessional team-based care has become the standard for practicing clinical pharmacists. However, it is difficult to simulate every aspect of this environment in the didactic curriculum. The purpose of this study was to determine if the addition of standardized patients (SP) or interprofessional student teams with SPs, to the use of a simulated electronic health record (EHR) improved student knowledge retention and perceptions.Methods. This was a prospective cohort study assessing three cohorts of first-year student pharmacists in pharmacy skills laboratory activities that occurred in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The primary objective of the study was to compare knowledge retention at 1-month related to the case material between groups. Each year an element of simulated experience was added onto the previous year's case. In 2018, students completed the case using the EHR web application only. In 2019, an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with SPs was combined with the previous year's experience. In 2021, student physician assistants were added to the 2019 experience. Case scores and student perceptions were also compared between groups.Results. Of the 260 potential participants, 238 students were included in the primary analysis. Significant improvement was demonstrated in one-month knowledge retention assessments with the addition of interprofessional team-based care and SPs. Mean knowledge retention assessment scores were 63.8%, 71.7%, and 76.1% respectively. There was also significant improvement in student perceptions.Conclusion. The addition of SPs and interprofessional team-based care to a pharmacy skills laboratory that utilizes a simulated EHR significantly improved student knowledge retention and perceptions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
349,34863164,"""This is streets ahead of what we used to do"": staff perceptions of virtual clinical pharmacy services in rural and remote Australian hospitals. BACKGROUND The use of medications is the most common intervention in healthcare. However, unsafe medication practices and medication errors are a leading cause of injury and avoidable harm in healthcare systems across the world. A Virtual Clinical Pharmacy Service (VCPS) was introduced in rural and remote New South Wales public hospitals to support safe and effective use of medications. In this model clinical pharmacy services are delivered via a telehealth cart at the patient's bedside and through electronic medical and pharmaceutical record systems. The aim of this research was to understand healthcare staff perspectives of the VCPS and identify areas for improvement. METHODS A qualitative approach informed by Appreciative Inquiry was used to investigate healthcare staff perceptions of the VCPS. Focus group discussions (n = 15) with hospital staff and medical officers were conducted via videoconference at each study site. Focus groups explored issues, benefits and barriers 3 months after service implementation. Transcribed data were analysed using thematic analysis and team discussion to synthesise themes. RESULTS Focus group participants identified the value of the VCPS to patients, to the health service and to themselves. They also identified enhancements to increase value for each of these groups. Perceived benefits to patients included access to specialist medication advice and improved medication knowledge. Staff valued access to an additional, trusted workforce who provided back-up and guidance. Staff also reported confidence in improved patient safety and identification of medication errors. Enhanced compliance with antimicrobial stewardship and hospital accreditation standards were beneficial to the health service. Suggested improvements included extending virtual service hours and widening patient eligibility to include aged care patients. CONCLUSIONS The VCPS brought a positive, collegiate culture regarding medications. Healthcare staff perceived the VCPS was effective and an efficient way for the health service to supply pharmacy services to smaller hospitals. The ease of use, model of delivery, availability, local knowledge and responsiveness of highly skilled pharmacists was the key to user satisfaction.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess and evaluate knowledge and application of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) among pharmacists and physicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge of and attitudes toward the new FDA PLLR among pharmacists and physicians. The primary outcome for this study was knowledge of the FDA PLLR. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted for all study variables, and linear regression analyses were conducted to assess predictive factors of knowledge of the FDA PLLR. SPSS version 25 was used, and all analyses were conducted at an alpha value of 0.05. RESULTS In a cross-sectional study that included 167 pharmacists and physicians, majority were pharmacists (78.4%), and the rest were physicians (21.6%). The overall knowledge score was low with the average number of items answered correctly being 3.03 out of 7. Of all explored predictors, only gender (P < 0.01) and pregnancy letter category knowledge score (P < 0.05) were significant predictors of PLLR knowledge, adjusting for the other factors.

351,34863634,"Improved asthma outcomes among at-risk children in a pharmacist-led, interdisciplinary school-based health clinic: A pilot study of the CAReS program. BACKGROUND Disparities in access to care and outcomes have been identified among children with asthma living in underserved communities. The Caring for Asthma in our Region's Schoolchildren program was established to reduce disparities by providing school-based, comprehensive asthma care by a pharmacist-led, interdisciplinary team to high-risk pediatric populations in the Greater Pittsburgh area. OBJECTIVE To investigate program impact on follow-up appointment attendance, delivery of guideline-based care, asthma control, asthma morbidity (emergency department [ED] visits, oral corticosteroid [OCS] requirement), and asthma-related knowledge and quality of life. METHODS The study enrolled 50 children with asthma from 6 elementary schools (September 2014-December 2017). Children completed 5 visits over a 3-month period. McNemar's test assessed improvement in guideline-based controller therapy use and reduced morbidity (ED visits or OCS requirement). Generalized estimating equation analyses determined the significance of monthly improvements in asthma control, asthma knowledge, and quality of life. RESULTS A 100% show rate was achieved in nearly all participants (92.0%). Most of the patients were African-American (56%). In children with persistent disease, only 21.4% were prescribed controller therapy at baseline, which improved to 78.5% upon enrollment (P < 0.05). Asthma control statistically significantly improved (P < 0.05), and a reduction in percentage of patients who required an ED visit or an OCS burst pre-to postintervention was also statistically significant (31.3% vs. 14.6%, P < 0.05). The goal of 100% treatment plan knowledge was achieved in 67% of caregivers within 1 month and increased from 6% to 60% in children over 3 months (P < 0.05). Asthma-related quality of life also improved statistically significantly pre-to postintervention (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Disparities in asthma outcomes owing to inadequate access to health care can be addressed. Improved asthma control, asthma medication knowledge, quality of life, and reduced morbidity in high-risk pediatric patients are achievable as demonstrated by our study.

BACKGROUND There is limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of push-dose vasopressor (PDP) use outside of the operating room (OR). Specifically, there are few head-to-head comparisons of different PDP in these settings. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of push-dose phenylephrine (PDP-PE) and epinephrine (PDP-E) in the Emergency Department (ED). METHODS This retrospective, single-center study evaluated adults given PDP-PE or PDP-E in the ED from May 2017 to November 2020. The primary outcome was a change in heart rate (HR). Secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, adverse effects, dosing errors, fluid and vasopressor requirements, ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Ninety-six patients were included in the PDP-PE group and 39 patients in the PDP-E group. Median changes in HR were 0 [-7, 6] and - 2 [-15, 5] beats per minute (BPM) for PDP-PE and PDP-E, respectively (p = 0.138). PDP-E patients had a greater median increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (33 [24, 53] vs. 26 [8, 51] mmHg; p = 0.049). Dosing errors occurred more frequently in patients that received PDP-E (5/39 [12.8%] vs. 2/96 [2.1%]; p = 0.021). PDP-E patients more frequently received continuous epinephrine infusions before and after receiving PDP-E. There were no differences in adverse effects, fluid requirements, LOS, or mortality. CONCLUSION PDP-E provided a greater increase in SBP compared to PDP-PE. However, dosing errors occurred more frequently in those receiving PDP-E. Larger head-to-head studies are necessary to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDP-E and PDP-PE.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
354,34864356,"Broadening access to naloxone: Community predictors of standing order naloxone distribution in Massachusetts. BACKGROUND Naloxone is a prescription medication that reverses opioid overdoses. Allowing naloxone to be dispensed directly by a pharmacist without an individual prescription under a naloxone standing order (NSO) can expand access. The community-level factors associated with naloxone dispensed under NSO are unknown. METHODS Using a dataset comprised of pharmacy reports of naloxone dispensed under NSO from 70% of Massachusetts retail pharmacies, we examined relationships between community-level demographics, rurality, measures of treatment for opioid use disorder, and overdose deaths with naloxone dispensed under NSO per ZIP Code-quarter from 2014 until 2018. We used a multi-variable zero-inflated negative binomial model, assessing odds of any naloxone dispensed under NSO, as well as a multi-variable negative binomial model assessing quantities of naloxone dispensed under NSO. RESULTS From 2014-2018, quantities of naloxone dispensed under NSO and the number of pharmacies dispensing any naloxone under NSO increased over time. However, communities with greater percentages of people with Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.96 per 5% increase), and rural communities compared to urban communities (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90) were less likely to dispense any naloxone by NSO. Communities with more individuals treated with buprenorphine dispensed more naloxone under NSO, as did communities with more opioid-related overdose deaths. CONCLUSION Naloxone dispensing has substantially increased, in part driven by standing orders. A lower likelihood of naloxone being dispensed under NSO in communities with larger Hispanic populations and in more rural communities suggests the need for more equitable access to, and uptake of, lifesaving medications like naloxone.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Mindfulness approaches have been demonstrated to have positive results in the general population and in other healthcare professions. However, limited studies have been performed evaluating mindfulness approaches in student pharmacists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of daily use of a mindfulness mobile application in improving student pharmacists' perceived stress, burnout, and mindfulness. METHODS This study was a randomized, longitudinal, waitlist-controlled trial. The intervention group was asked to meditate using the mindfulness application Headspace daily for at least 6 weeks. The waitlist control group was asked to abstain from using the application for the entire study. Stress, burnout, and mindfulness were assessed using validated survey instruments at baseline, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks. A secondary outcome was to assess the persistence of application use after the intervention period. RESULTS Fifty-six participants completed the study. The intervention group reported significantly lower scores on stress and burnout at 6 weeks compared to the control group. The intervention group also reported significantly higher scores on mindfulness. The differences in stress, burnout, and mindfulness persisted at follow-up. The mean percentage of students in the intervention group who used the application each day was 90% over the intervention period and 62% over the follow-up period. CONCLUSION A mindfulness mobile application significantly improved student pharmacists' stress, burnout, and mindfulness with daily use.

PURPOSE To summarize recently published research reports and practice guidelines deemed to be significantly impactful for pediatric pharmacy practice. SUMMARY Our author group was composed of 8 board-certified pediatric pharmacists. Eight major themes were identified: critical care, hematology/oncology, medication safety, general pediatrics, infectious diseases, neurology/psychiatry, gastrointestinal/nutrition, and neonatology. The author group was assigned a specific theme(s) based on their practice expertise and were asked to identify articles using MEDLINE and/or searches of relevant journal articles pertaining to each theme that were published from January 2019 through December 2020 that they felt were ""significant"" for pediatric pharmacy practice. A final list of compiled articles was distributed to the authors, and an article was considered significant if it received a vote from 5 of the 8 authors. Thirty-two articles, including 16 clinical practice guidelines or position statements and 16 review or primary literature articles, were included in this review. For each of these articles, a narrative regarding its implications for pediatric pharmacy practice is provided. CONCLUSION Given the heterogeneity of pediatric patients, it is difficult for pediatric pharmacists to stay up to date with the most recent literature, especially in practice areas outside their main expertise. Over the last few years, there has been a significant number of publications impacting the practice of pediatric pharmacists. This review of articles that have significantly affected pediatric pharmacy practice may be helpful in staying up to date on key articles in the literature.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this evaluation was to compare the relationship of medication regimen complexity versus a traditional patient acuity metric for evaluating pharmacist interventions. SUMMARY This was a post hoc analysis of a previously completed prospective, observational study. Pharmacist interventions were prospectively collected and tabulated at 24 hours, 48 hours, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge, and the electronic medical record was reviewed to collect patient demographics, medication data, and outcomes. The primary outcome was the relationship between medication regimen complexity-intensive care unit (MRC-ICU) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and pharmacist interventions at 24 hours, 48 hours, and ICU discharge. These relationships were determined by Spearman rank-order correlation (rS) and confirmed by calculating the beta coefficient (β) via multiple linear regression adjusting for patient age, gender, and admission type. Data on 100 patients admitted to a mixed medical/surgical ICU were retrospectively evaluated. Both MRC-ICU and APACHE II scores were correlated with ICU interventions at all 3 time points (at 24 hours, rS = 0.370 [P < 0.001] for MRC-ICU score and rS = 0.283 [P = 0.004] for APACHE II score); however, this relationship was not sustained for APACHE II in the adjusted analysis (at 24 hours, β = 0.099 [P = 0.001] for MRC-ICU and β = 0.031 [P = 0.085] for APACHE II score). CONCLUSION A pharmacist-oriented score had a stronger relationship with pharmacist interventions as compared to patient acuity. As pharmacists have demonstrated value across the continuum of patient care, these findings support that pharmacist-oriented workload predictions require tailored metrics, beyond that of patient acuity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
361,34864858,"Development of a specialty medication clinical dashboard to improve tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor safety and adherence monitoring. PURPOSE To describe the development of a pilot specialty medication clinical dashboard targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitor therapy. SUMMARY This was a quality improvement project conducted between August 2019 and April 2020. The dashboard was designed with collaboration between clinical pharmacists and specialty providers in rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology. Data was queried from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. Patients with an active prescription or intravenous order for a TNF-α inhibitor were included. Dashboard flag criteria focused on TNF-α inhibitor safety and adherence monitoring. Flag results from the dashboard were characterized from data captured at a single time point. For 431 patients on TNF-α inhibitor treatment at the institution, 304 flags corresponding to 223 unique patients (51.7%) were identified on the dashboard: 3% of patients had a new infection, 9% had overdue monitoring laboratory tests, 5% had a critical laboratory result, 2% were on 2 biologic agents, 27% were overdue for a refill, 6% had an emergency department visit, and 2% had an inpatient admission. No patients were flagged for heart failure exacerbation or new malignancy. Seventeen percent of patients were prescribed high-dose etanercept or adalimumab, representing a potential annual cost savings of $302,497 if 50% of these patients had their dose successfully reduced to labeled dosing. Opportunities for pharmacist intervention utilizing the dashboard were identified and characterized through chart review of flagged patients. CONCLUSION Pharmacists have the opportunity to improve safety and adherence for TNF-α inhibitor therapy through use of a specialty medication clinical dashboard. The dashboard should be used in conjunction with collaborative practice protocols.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
362,34864859,"A multifaceted stewardship intervention helps curb steroid overprescribing in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. PURPOSE Corticosteroid overprescribing is well documented in real-world practice. There is currently no evidence to guide best practices for steroid stewardship. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a 3-part stewardship intervention strategy on inpatient steroid prescribing in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). SUMMARY Investigators implemented a 3-part stewardship initiative consisting of (1) an anonymous survey for providers on steroid prescribing in a simplified case of AECOPD, (2) face-to-face education and review of survey results, and (3) prospective audit and feedback from a clinical pharmacist. This was a quasi-experimental before-and-after study evaluating hospitalized adults diagnosed with AECOPD in two 12-month study periods before (April 2019-March 2020) and after (May 2020-April 2021) implementation. The primary outcome was mean inpatient steroid dosing. Secondary outcomes were duration of therapy, length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmissions, 30-day mortality, and incidence of hyperglycemia. Per power analysis, there were 27 patients per cohort. The interventions resulted in a significant reduction in prednisone equivalents during hospitalization: 118 mg vs 53 mg (P = 0.0003). This decrease was similar in ICU (160 mg vs 61 mg, P = 0.008) and non-ICU (102 mg vs 49 mg, P = 0.004) locations. There was no significant difference in duration of therapy (8 days vs 7 days, P = 0.44), length of stay (3.3 days vs 3.9 days, P = 0.21), 30-day mortality (4% vs 7%, P = 0.55), 30-day readmissions (15% vs 7%, P = 0.39), or rate of hyperglycemia (48% vs 44%, P = 0.78). CONCLUSION A multifaceted stewardship intervention significantly reduced steroid dosing in hospitalized AECOPD patients. This reduction was not associated with known deleterious effects.",1,1,0,0,0,Unclear if observed effect can be attributed to pharmacist intervention.,,,,,,,,,

364,34865656,"Assessment of the potential impact of resolving drug-related problems by clinical pharmacists in Japan: a retrospective observational study. BACKGROUND Clinical pharmacists play a role in limiting the disadvantages of pharmacotherapy for patients by detecting and resolving drug-related problems (DRPs) through medication reviews. Although their contributions to patient care have been analyzed and understood in various countries, the role of Japanese clinical pharmacists in this context remains to be clearly elucidated. Thus, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the detection of DRPs by clinical pharmacists and determine the potential impact of pharmacist interventions in Japan. METHODS This study was conducted in a 273-bed hospital and targeted hospitalized patients over a period of 6 months. DRPs detected by clinical pharmacists during the study period were investigated and classified into 10 types. Furthermore, medications were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. A review committee consisting of two pharmacists independently reviewed the pharmacist interventions on a six-point scale (extremely significant, very significant, significant, somewhat significant, no significance, adverse significance) according to the potential impact on patient care. RESULTS During the study period, 1711 patients (mean age: 71.2 years, 54.1% male) were included, and 2149 DRPs were detected (1.26 DRPs/patient). Pharmacists intervened in all the DRPs detected. The most common DRP was supratherapeutic dosage (19.3%), followed by untreated indication (18.1%). The most common medication classification causing DRPs was ""Antiinfectives for Systemic Use"" (25.1%), followed by ""Alimentary Tract and Metabolism"" (19.9%). Most of the pharmacist interventions (99.6%) were rated ""somewhat significant"" or more significant, of which 1.1% were rated ""extremely significant,"" and none were rated as ""adverse significance."" CONCLUSIONS Our results show that in Japan, as in other countries, clinical pharmacists detect and resolve DRPs in hospitalized patients through medication review. Our findings also show that clinical pharmacists have a positive impact on patient care and suggest the need for their involvement.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

366,34866818,"Management of Drug-Drug Interactions among Critically Ill Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: Impact of Clinical Pharmacist's Interventions. Background and objectives Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can create a burden on prescribers to preserve patient safety. This study aimed to identify common DDIs in critically ill patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to evaluate clinical pharmacist's interventions in managing DDIs among these patients. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted from October 2018 to March 2019. The clinical pharmacist performed a medication chart review; DDIs were identified by using Lexicomp® drug interaction. Based on the occurrence of DDIs, patients were divided into group A: patients with DDI (n = 76) and group B: patients without DDI (n = 15). Clinical pharmacist's interventions were classified according to Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe. The National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention was used to categorize the severity outcomes of DDIs and the degree of patient harm. Results A total of 273 DDIs were identified. The majority of DDIs (63.7%) required close monitoring of the therapeutic outcome to ensure maintaining patient safety. DDIs that needed to be managed by considering therapy modification and avoiding drug combination were accounted for 17.2 and 12.8% of the most common detected interactions, respectively. Seventy-eight percent of DDIs induced no harm to patient. Clinical pharmacist provided different types of recommendations to manage detected interactions, which ranged from therapy outcome monitoring to stop DDIs. A great proportion of pharmacist's interventions (92%) were accepted by prescribers. Compared to patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, patients with stage 5 had a significantly higher number of DDIs (stage 3 vs 5: p = 0.0019, stage 4 vs 5: p = 0.0456). The number of comorbidities (p = 0.0003) and (p <0.0001) medications were found to be significantly greater in group A.

367,34866874,"Literature Review of Type 2 Diabetes Management and Health Literacy. Objective The purpose of this literature review was to identify educational approaches addressing low health literacy for people with type 2 diabetes. Low health literacy can lead to poor management of diabetes, low engagement with health care providers, increased hospitalization rates, and higher health care costs. These challenges can be even more profound among minority populations and non-English speakers in the United States. Methods A literature search and standard data extraction were performed using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE databases. A total of 1,914 articles were identified, of which 1,858 were excluded based on the inclusion criteria, and 46 were excluded because of a lack of relevance to both diabetes management and health literacy. The remaining 10 articles were reviewed in detail. Results Patients, including ethnic minorities and non-English speakers, who are engaged in diabetes education and health literacy improvement initiatives and ongoing follow-up showed significant improvement in A1C, medication adherence, medication knowledge, and treatment satisfaction. Clinicians considering implementing new interventions to address diabetes care for patients with low health literacy can use culturally tailored approaches, consider ways to create materials for different learning styles and in different languages, engage community health workers and pharmacists to help with patient education, use patient-centered medication labels, and engage instructors who share cultural and linguistic similarities with patients to provide educational sessions. Conclusion This literature review identified a variety of interventions that had a positive impact on provider-patient communication, medication adherence, and glycemic control by promoting diabetes self-management through educational efforts to address low health literacy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
368,34867311,"Understanding Stakeholder Views Regarding the Design of an Intervention Trial to Reduce Anticholinergic Burden: A Qualitative Study.  Background: Anticholinergic burden (ACB), is defined as the cumulative effect of anticholinergic medication which are widely prescribed to older adults despite increasing ACB being associated with adverse effects such as: falls, dementia and increased mortality. This research explores the views of health care professionals (HCPs) and patients on a planned trial to reduce ACB by stopping or switching anticholinergic medications. The objectives were to explore the views of key stakeholders (patients, the public, and HCPs) regarding the potential acceptability, design and conduct of an ACB reduction trial. Materials and Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups with 25 HCPs involved in prescribing medication with anticholinergic properties and with 22 members of the public and patients who were prescribed with the medication. Topic guides for the interviews and focus groups explored aspects of feasibility including: 1) views of a trial of de-prescribing/medication switching; 2) how to best communicate information about such a trial; 3) views on who would be best placed and preferred to undertake such medication changes, e.g., pharmacists or General Practitioners (GPs)? 4) perceived barriers and facilitators to trial participation and the smooth conduct of such a trial; 5) HCP views on the future implementability of this approach to reducing ACB and 6) patients' willingness to be contacted for participation in a future trial. Qualitative data analysis was underpinned by Normalization Process Theory. Results: The public, patients and HCPs were supportive of an ACB reduction trial. There was consensus among the different groups that key points to consider with such a trial included: 1) ensuring patient engagement throughout to enable concerns/potential pitfalls to be addressed from the beginning; 2) ensuring clear communication to minimise potential misconceptions about the reasons for ACB reduction; and 3) provision of access to a point of contact for patients throughout the life of a trial to address concerns; The HCPs in particular suggested two more key points: 4) minimise the workload implications of any trial; and 5) pharmacists may be best placed to carry out ACB reviews, though overall responsibility for patient medication should remain with GPs. Conclusion: Patients, the public and HCPs are supportive of trials to reduce ACB. Good communication and patient engagement during design and delivery of a trial are essential as well as safety netting and minimising workload.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns toward gene therapy in Saudi Arabia. We conducted an online cross-sectional survey via convenience sampling during the period from December 2018 to March 2019. A total of 419 (358 pharmacists and 61 physicians) responded to our questionnaire. Three hundred and nine (73.7%) were male, and the mean (±SD) age of 32.0 ± 7.7 years. The mean knowledge scores of all participants, pharmacists, and physicians were 3.8 ± 1.9, 3.8 ± 1.9, and 3.7 ± 1.9, respectively (P = 0.73). Higher knowledge score was associated with younger age (Coefficient: -0.03; P = 0.02), male (Coefficient: 0.57; P = 0.01), master's degree (Coefficient: 0.93; P = 0.003) and Ph.D. holders (Coefficient: 1.10; P = 0.01), and participants graduated from Canada (Coefficient: 2.10; P = 0.01).Moreover, about half of the respondents (55%) were concerned about gene therapy, and genetics training at college was considered the best gene therapy education method by 69.4%. Attitude score was not significantly associated with the profession (P = 0.88) but positively correlated with the knowledge score (rho= 0.4; P < 0.001).

371,34870263,"Community pharmacists' views on providing a reproductive health service to women receiving opioid substitution treatment: A qualitative study using the TDF and COM-B. Background The absence of menstruation is common in women who use drugs. This can give a belief that conception is unlikely. When stabilised on Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST), fertility often returns, initially without realisation as ovulation precedes menstruation. This leaves women vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies. Community pharmacists (CPs) are frequently in contact with this patient group through the Supervised Consumption of OST service. This provides a timely opportunity to provide reproductive health (RH) advice. The aim of this study was to investigate pharmacists' views on providing a RH service to women receiving OST. Methods Twenty semi-structured interviews based on the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation to Behaviour (COM-B) model and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) were conducted between 2016 and 2017. Data analysis involved deductive coding using the TDF domains. The TDF domains were mapped onto the elements of the COM-B and used in the second step to create the framework and chart the data. The third step involved re-reading and clustering the codes, and inductive themes were generated to explain the data in depth. Results Nine of the 14 TDF domains, mapped into five elements of the COM-B, were identified. Five inductive themes were generated: 1) The pharmacists' experience and knowledge of reproductive health (RH) needs of women receiving OST, 2) The pharmacists' approach to providing advice, 3) The pharmacists' perception of the relationship with women receiving OST, 4) Social influences, and 5) Environmental factors. Community pharmacists feared causing offense to women receiving OST and described requiring cues as to when the service was needed. Pharmacists' highlighted a power imbalance in the relationship with women receiving OST. This could influence how receptive this patient group would be to pharmacy RH interventions. Conclusions CPs' concerns of providing RH service could hinder a proactive service provision. Supporting good rapport and providing a structured consultation would increase the accessibility of such a service.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

ABSTRACT The technical level and comprehensive quality of pharmacy intravenous admixture services (PIVAS) staff are central to ensure the safety and effectiveness of intravenous infusions. However, these aspects are lacking in traditional pharmacy education. This study aimed to investigate the training status of staff working in PIVAS and explore factors that affected training status, which might contribute to the establishment of a comprehensive, standardized training system.A multi-center cross-sectional survey was conducted via a WeChat Group targeting PIVAS staff in hospitals to investigate the differences of current training status between different regions, hospital levels, genders, job titles, educational degrees, employment types, and working years.In total, 501 participants completed the questionnaires. The main contents of training for PIVAS staff included: professional theoretical knowledge (99.40%, 498/501), practical operation abilities (97.01%, 486/501), pre-job training (92.61%, 464/501), and standard operating procedures (90.22%, 452/501). The most common frequency of staff training was 1-2 times a month (51.9%, 260/501). Overall, 56.5% (283/501) of participants thought staff training was sufficient and 60.1% (301/501) of participants thought PIVAS attached importance to staff training. However, only 45.7% (229/501) of the participants were satisfied with the training modes.The contents of training for PIVAS staff in mainland China were relatively rich, but the aspects of management tools, comprehensive ability development, and career development planning tend to be relatively weak.

374,34872281,"Pharmacist-led quality control circle in sustained reduction of carbapenem-resistance at a Chinese tertiary teaching hospital. BACKGROUND The spread of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria poses a substantial threat to morbidity and mortality worldwide, which is mainly attributed to the overuse of carbapenem. This study aimed to evaluate the use of a quality control circle (QCC) in controlling the overuse of carbapenems and improving the state of carbapenem resistance at a Chinese tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS A pharmacist-led multidisciplinary QCC project was carried out and the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) method was applied for 12 months. The data on carbapenem consumption, bacterial identification, and antibacterial susceptibility testing were collected to evaluate the effect of this project. RESULTS The antibiotics use density (AUD) of carbapenems exhibited a decreasing trend over time (P<0.001), and the AUD of meropenem, imipenem, and biapenem decreased by 30.20%, 42.45%, and 78.05% after the intervention, respectively. The total AUD of carbapenems decreased from 7.37 to 3.96, which included the decrease in the irrational use of carbapenems by 1.61, accounting for 47.21% of the total. Moreover, the positive correlations were discovered between the resistance rate of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP)/Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and the AUD of carbapenems (P<0.05).

375,34872522,"Evaluation of parental knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections in children under 18 years of age: a cross-sectional study in Turkey. BACKGROUND Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are common in children. Antibiotics still continue to be prescribed although most URTIs are of viral origin. This is inappropriate use and this unnecessary administration contributes or may cause antibiotic resistance. The problem of unnecessary antibiotic use among children is a concern for antibiotic resistance in low- and middle-income developing countries. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of parents of children with upper respiratory tract infections regarding antibiotic use and their antibiotic administration practices in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey. METHODS Our study is a cross-sectional survey study. It was carried out between 14 December 2020 and 1 April 2021 for parents over 18 years of age with a child under 18 years' old who applied to the general pediatrics outpatient clinics of Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Department of Pediatrics. RESULTS Five hundred fifty-four parents responded to the questionnaire (93.2% rate of response). A total of 15.7% of parents stated to use antibiotics in any child with fever. 37% of parents believed that antibiotics could cure infections caused by viruses. 6.3% of parents declared that they put pressure on pediatricians to prescribe antibiotics. While 28% of the parents who thought that the use of inappropriate antibiotics would not change the effect and resistance of the treatment, 41% thought that new antibiotics could be developed continuously. 85.6% of the parents stated that they never gave their children non-prescription antibiotics when they had a high fever. 80.9% of them declared that they never used past antibiotics in the presence of a new infection. CONCLUSION According to the results of our study of parents' lack of knowledge about antibiotics in Turkey, though generally it shows proper attitude and practices. It shows that some of the restrictions imposed by the National Action Plan are partially working. However, it is still necessary to continue to inform parents, pediatricians and pharmacists about the use of antibiotics, and to be more sensitive about the prescribing of antibiotics, and if necessary, sanctions should be imposed by the state in order to prevent unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
376,34872605,"Value of pharmacy services upon admission to an orthopedic surgery unit. BACKGROUND In Lebanon, the role of the pharmacist remains underestimated in the medication reconciliation process, especially in surgical departments. This study aims to assess the impact of pharmacist-conducted medication reconciliation performed within 48 h of hospital admission to the orthopedic surgical department. METHODS This was a prospective single-arm study conducted in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Lebanon between October 2019 and April 2020. Participants were adult inpatients hospitalized for orthopedic surgeries with ≥ 1 outpatient medications. Properly trained pharmacy resident obtained the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) and led the reconciliation process. The primary endpoint was the number of reconciliation errors (REs) identified. Descriptive statistics were used to report participants' responses and relevant findings. Linear regression was performed with the number of REs as a continuous dependent variable using backward method. Results were assumed to be significant when p was < 0.05. RESULTS The study included 100 patients with a mean age of 73.8 years, admitted for elective (54%) or emergency (46%) surgeries. Half of the study population had ≥ 5 home medications. The mean time for taking BPMH was around 8 min. A total of 110 REs were identified in 74 patient cases. The most common discrepancies consisted of medication omission (89.1%) and the most common medications involved were antihyperlipidemic agents. Twenty-four REs were judged as clinically significant, and four as serious. The most common interventions included the addition of a medication (71.9%). Most of the relayed interventions (84.5%) were accepted. The number of home medications was the only variable significantly associated with the number of REs (β 0.492; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Pharmacy-led medication reconciliation upon admission to orthopedic surgery department can reduce reconciliation errors and improve medication safety.

377,34872856,"A safe in-home disposal system with every opioid prescription? Food and Drug Administration is considering a potential new Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy that could impact pharmacists.  Misuse of prescription opioids contributes to the ongoing crisis of opioid-related overdose and deaths in the United States. The failure of patients and caregivers to safely dispose of unused opioids contributes to the problems. In 2018, Public Law 115-271 provided the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to mandate a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for safe disposal packaging or safe disposal solutions for opioid analgesic medications. The FDA has been collaborating with stakeholders to determine whether a new REMS is needed. A new or revised opioid REMS could substantially affect opioid packaging, pharmacist roles and services, and dispensing activities such as education, counseling, and product distribution. The pharmacy profession has provided limited input to FDA regarding a potential new or revised opioid REMS. In this commentary, we aim to (1) provide awareness and raise questions on pertinent issues regarding opioid use and safe home disposal, (2) offer considerations for regulators on needed research in the development and assessment of a new REMS, and (3) highlight actions for pharmacist engagement in patient care services to promote safe use and safe home disposal of opioids. Consideration of a potential mandate regarding enhanced safety packaging or safe disposal solutions for opioids presents opportunities to revisit professional roles and engage proactively with the FDA and other stakeholders. We hope this commentary stimulates timely feedback by pharmacy leaders, researchers, and practitioners on whether and how options for safe home disposal of opioids should be included in a REMS in contemplation of potential benefits, unintended consequences, expanded professional roles, timeline, assessment of program effectiveness, and adequate compensation. We support a shared opioid REMS that funds the counseling of patients and caregivers on safe opioid use and safe home opioid disposal options and provides appropriate education and products to facilitate that disposal.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
378,34872857,"Creation and implementation of a pharmacy-led meds-to-beds program at a large teaching hospital. BACKGROUND ""Meds-to-beds"" programs are a quality improvement intervention that is gaining wider implementation throughout the United States. The University of Oklahoma hospital system did not have this program and sought to implement one. There are sufficient data on the benefits of meds-to-beds programs, but there is a lack of literature on describing the development and implementation process. OBJECTIVES The objective of this article is to describe the planning process, implementation, and barriers encountered during the organization of a pharmacy-led meds-to-beds program operating within 2 large teaching hospitals. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campus has 7 colleges, multiple primary care and specialty clinics, and 2 hospitals. In addition, there are 3 on-campus outpatient pharmacies operated by the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy (OUCOP). PRACTICE INNOVATION The college implemented a meds-to-beds program primarily serving 2 on-campus hospitals, The Oklahoma Children's Hospital and University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy Medical Center. The program operated out of The Children's Pharmacy, an outpatient pharmacy located within the Children's Hospital. EVALUATION METHODS A Plan-Do-Study-Act model was used, which allowed for adaptation in response to barriers encountered throughout the process. Frequent meetings among stakeholders were held to continuously evaluate progress (e.g., awareness and utilization of the program and prescription counts) and make necessary changes. RESULTS Implementation of the program required changes in workflow both within the pharmacy and within the registration and discharge processes of medical teams. In addition, after the initiation of the meds-to-beds program, the daily prescription count more than doubled. The program averages 40 deliveries per day and 3 prescriptions per delivery and continues to grow, providing evidence of a successful meds-to-beds implementation. CONCLUSION The Plan-Do-Study-Act model allowed for many adjustments to be made throughout the process, including the conversion from an opt-in to an opt-out model to increase program utilization.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Prescribing trends, such as species and errors, were assessed using descriptive statistics for the overall sample. Error comparisons between written and verbal prescriptions and between weight-based and nonweight-based prescriptions were assessed using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS Weight, although not legally required but clinically necessary for evaluation of veterinary prescriptions, was omitted from 97.8% of prescriptions. When evaluating the prevalence of errors between handwritten and verbal prescriptions, it was more likely to see errors in prescriptions handwritten by the veterinarian (105 of 119; 88%) than verbal prescriptions (257 of 389; 66%). Conversely, handwritten prescriptions were less likely to omit the required Drug Enforcement Agency number on controlled substance prescriptions. CONCLUSION Based on the number of errors seen in both handwritten and verbal prescriptions, emphasis should be placed on training pharmacists to be competent in clinically evaluating veterinary prescriptions and training veterinarians on handwriting prescriptions to include both legally and clinically required information needed before dispensing.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
380,34872859,"Impact of a pharmacist-run weight loss medication management service. BACKGROUND Weight loss medications have been shown to be effective for weight loss and reducing disease state risk in patients who are overweight or obese. However, it is unknown what impact pharmacists have on weight loss when providing medication management services. OBJECTIVE To evaluate weight loss outcomes and clinic utilization of a pharmacist-run weight loss pharmacotherapy service at the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) in Nashville, TN. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Patients enrolled in the MOVE! weight loss program were referred to a clinical pharmacy specialist (CPS) who was able to assess comorbidities, prescribe weight loss medication, and provide ongoing follow-up via telehealth visits. PRACTICE INNOVATION This is the first description of a pharmacist-run weight loss pharmacotherapy clinic. This model expanded the role of pharmacists at TVHS, where CPS involvement was previously limited to chart reviews when medication recommendations were requested. EVALUATION This prospective quality improvement project evaluated patients seen by the CPS in the first 6 months of clinic implementation. Primary outcomes included change in weight and proportion of patients with at least 5% weight loss at the end of the study period. Results were compared with patients seen by preventative medicine providers (PMPs) in the same time frame. RESULTS A total of 79 patients were seen in the CPS clinic, and 40 met inclusion criteria. The clinic utilization rate was 100%. Mean weight change was -3.6 ± 5.7 kg (P < 0.001), and 25% of patients followed up by the CPS lost at least 5% body weight. In the PMP clinic, 29 patients demonstrated a mean weight change of -1.6 ± 6.0 kg (P = 0.15 compared with baseline), and 17.2% lost at least 5% body weight. CONCLUSION This pharmacist-led weight loss clinic demonstrated statistically significant reductions in weight and was able to expand access to care for patients seeking weight loss services.",1,1,0,0,1,Reviewer 2 initially did not see that a control group was included.,Study,,,Other,Established through discussion to test label choices,,,Ambulatory,Established through discussion to test label choices
381,34872966,"Evaluation of medication changes following severe COVID-19 infection: a multicentre evaluation. BACKGROUND Critically ill patients often experience several transitions of care following critical illness. Research has explored the challenges which patients have with medication management across these transitions. It is unclear whether patients admitted to critical care due to COVID-19 will have similar challenges. The aim of this study was to explore medication management in critical care survivors following severe COVID-19. METHODS Between 3 and 7 months post hospital discharge, patients who had been admitted to critical care due to severe COVID-19 were invited to an established recovery service. During the clinic consultation a medication review was performed by a pharmacist. This included medicines reconciliation, assessing the appropriateness of each of the prescribed medications and identification of medication changes. We also assessed changes to pain management in the discharge period. RESULTS In total, 78 patients had a full medication review available. Over 70% of patients were taking an increased dose of medicine or a new medicine at clinic. There was a significant overall increase in new medication during the clinic consultation, across different British National Formulary classifications (OR: 1.73 (95% CI: 1.28 to 2.34), p<0.001). Compared with pre critical care admission, there was a significant increase in the number of patients taking regular analgesia following severe COVID-19 infection (23 (29.5%) vs 39 (50%), p<0.001). CONCLUSION Following severe COVID-19, patients may require new or increasing doses of medicines. Ongoing review of these patients is crucial to ensure optimal outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
382,34873761,"Towards patient-centred communication in the management of older patients' medications across transitions of care: A focused ethnographic study. BACKGROUND Communication about managing medications during transitions of care can be a challenging process for older patients since they often have complex medication regimens. Previous studies highlighted that links between communication breakdowns and medication incidents in older patients occur mainly at discharge or in the post-discharge period. Little attention has been paid to exploring communication strategies facilitating patient-centred medication communication at transitions of care from a discourse-analytic perspective. OBJECTIVES To explore, through a discursive lens, strategies that enable patient-centred medication communication at transitions of care. DESIGN A focused ethnographic study was employed for this study. The study was reported according to the COREQ checklist. METHODS Interviews, observations and focus groups were analysed utilising Critical Discourse Analysis and the Medication Communication Model following thematic analysis. Data collection was undertaken in eight wards across two metropolitan hospitals in Australia. RESULTS Patient preferences and beliefs about medications were identified as important characteristics of patient-centred communication. Strategies included empathetic talk prioritising patients' medication needs and preferences for medications; informative talk clarifying patients' concerns; and encouraging talk for enhancing shared decision-making with older patients. Challenges relating to the use of these strategies included patients' hearing, speech or cognitive impairments, language barriers and absence of interpreters or family members during care transitions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE To enhance medication communication, nurses, doctors and pharmacists should incorporate older patients' preferences, previous experiences and beliefs, and consider the challenges faced by patients across transitions. Strategies encouraging patients' contribution to decision-making processes are crucial to patient-centeredness in medication communication. Nurses need to engage in informative talk more frequently when administering the medications to ensure older patients' understanding of medications prescribed or altered in hospital settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

384,34876318,"Pharmacist Interventions for Medication Adherence: Community Guide Economic Reviews for Cardiovascular Disease. INTRODUCTION Adherence to medications for cardiovascular disease and its risk factors is less than optimal, although greater adherence to medication has been shown to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This paper examines the economics of tailored pharmacy interventions to improve medication adherence for cardiovascular disease prevention and management. METHODS Literature from inception of databases to May 2019 was searched, yielding 29 studies for cardiovascular disease prevention and 9 studies for cardiovascular disease management. Analyses were done from June 2019 through May 2020. All monetary values are in 2019 U.S. dollars. RESULTS The median intervention cost per patient per year was $246 for cardiovascular disease prevention and $292 for cardiovascular disease management. The median change in healthcare cost per person per year due to the intervention was -$355 for cardiovascular disease prevention and -$2,430 for cardiovascular disease management. The median total cost per person per year was -$89 for cardiovascular disease prevention, with a median return on investment of 0.01. The median total cost per person per year for cardiovascular disease management was -$1,080, with a median return on investment of 7.52, and 6 of 7 estimates indicating reduced healthcare cost averted exceeded intervention cost. For cardiovascular disease prevention, the median cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was $11,298. There were no cost effectiveness studies for cardiovascular disease management. DISCUSSION The evidence shows that tailored pharmacy-based interventions to improve medication adherence are cost effective for cardiovascular disease prevention. For cardiovascular disease management, healthcare cost averted exceeds the cost of implementation for a favorable return on investment from a healthcare systems perspective.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Identifying the involvement of pharmacy technicians (PTs) in nonclinical and clinical duties will provide insight for improved pharmaceutical services. OBJECTIVES This study assessed the involvement of PTs in nonclinical tasks, patient-centered services, and more specialized patient care services and the difference in practice between hospital and community PTs. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a 5-point Likert scale, and an analysis of data was performed using IBM SPSS version 21.0 (IBM). Descriptive statistics was done, and P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was conducted in community and hospital pharmacies in Ogun State, Nigeria, among 100 PTs. Outcome measures were the involvement of PTs in clinical roles and other pharmaceutical care practices. RESULTS A total of 73 (73.0%) participated in the study, 45 (61.6%) and 28 (38.4%) practiced in hospital and community pharmacies, respectively. From the 11 listed nonclinical activities, only stocking of medications 61 (83.6%) and processing clients' or patient's charges 48 (65.8%) were often or very often performed. More than half of the participants often performed each of all 7 listed patient-centered activities, particularly empathy and confidentiality 62 (84.9%), providing information and referrals to patients or clients 56 (76.7%), and identifying patients or clients for counseling 51 (69.9%), respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between the practice areas (P > 0.05). Only 2 of the 11 listed specialized clinical activities were performed by more than half of the respondents: screening prescriptions for completeness and authenticity 43 (58.9%) and alerting the pharmacist of drug therapy problems 46 (63.0%). Differences in the practice of specialized tasks was statistically significant for consultations (P = 0.002) and resolution of clinical conflict (P = 0.040) between the practice areas. CONCLUSION Study participants were less frequently involved in nonclinical activities but often involved in clinical activities. They also participated in specialized clinical tasks at lesser frequencies. Differences were observed between the practice areas in performance of nonclinical and specialized activities.

386,34876416,"Using the Edmonton Obesity Staging System in the real world: a feasibility study based on cross-sectional data. BACKGROUND The Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) combined with body mass index (BMI) enables improved functional and prognostic assessment for patients. To facilitate application of the EOSS in practice, we aimed to create tools for capturing comorbidity assessments in electronic medical records and for automating the calculation of a patient's EOSS stage. METHODS In this feasibility study, we used cross-sectional data to create a clinical dashboard to calculate and display the relation between BMI and EOSS and the prevalence of related comorbidities. We obtained data from the Northern Alberta Primary Care Research Network and the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). We included patients at least 18 years of age with BMI between 30 and 60 who visited a network clinic between July 2016 and July 2019. We calculated descriptive statistics and used stepwise ordinary least squares regression to assess the contributions of age, sex and BMI to EOSS variation. RESULTS We created a clinical dashboard using the CPCSSN data presentation tool. Of the total 31 496 patients included in the study, 23 460 had a BMI of at least 30; BMI was unavailable for 8036 patients. Within each EOSS disease severity stage, there were similar proportions of patients from each BMI class (e.g., patients with EOSS stage 2 included 51.8% of those with BMI class I, 55.3% of those with BMI class II and 58.8% of those with BMI class III). INTERPRETATION Using data from primary care electronic medical records, it was feasible to create a clinical dashboard for obesity that highlighted the severity and stage of obesity.

387,34876549,"Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica): An Unusual Case of Galactorrhea.  BACKGROUND The increasing popularity and availability of herbal supplements among patients necessitates a better understanding of their mechanism of action and the effects they have on the body, both intended and unintended. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) is an herbaceous shrub found throughout the world that has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old woman with obesity and GERD presented to a primary care clinic with new-onset galactorrhea. A urine pregnancy test was negative. Prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and a metabolic panel were all within normal limits. A mammogram demonstrated scattered areas of fibroglandular density and benign-appearing calcifications in the left breast. The breast ultrasound showed no suspicious findings. Her medications included intermittent Echinacea, etonogestrel implant 68 mg subdermal, and the supplement stinging nettle 500 mg, which she had been taking over the past month for environmental allergies. After consultation with a clinical pharmacist, the stinging nettle was discontinued. No additional changes to her medications or supplements were made. One week after discontinuation, she returned to the clinic with complete resolution of the galactorrhea. CONCLUSIONS Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) is a common supplement and has effects on (1) sex hormone-binding globulin, (2) histamine-induced prolactin release, and (3) serotonin-induced release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. The local estrogen bioactivity in breast tissue may subsequently lead to gynecomastia and/or galactorrhea. Supplements are an often overlooked but a critical component of medication reconciliation and potential clinical adverse effects.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
388,34877629,"Frequency and Acceptance of Clinical Decision Support System-Generated STOPP/START Signals for Hospitalised Older Patients with Polypharmacy and Multimorbidity. BACKGROUND The Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions (STOPP)/Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment (START) instrument is used to evaluate the appropriateness of medication in older people. STOPP/START criteria have been converted into software algorithms and implemented in a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to facilitate their use in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine the frequency of CDSS-generated STOPP/START signals and their subsequent acceptance by a pharmacotherapy team in a hospital setting. DESIGN AND METHODS Hospitalised older patients with polypharmacy and multimorbidity allocated to the intervention arm of the OPERAM (OPtimising thERapy to prevent Avoidable hospital admissions in the Multimorbid elderly) trial underwent a CDSS-assisted structured medication review in four European hospitals. We evaluated the frequency of CDSS-generated STOPP/START signals and the subsequent acceptance of these signals by a trained pharmacotherapy team consisting of a physician and pharmacist after evaluation of clinical applicability to the individual patient, prior to discussing pharmacotherapy optimisation recommendations with the patient and attending physicians. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to investigate potential patient-related (e.g. age, number of co-morbidities and medications) and setting-related (e.g. ward type, country of inclusion) determinants for acceptance of STOPP and START signals. RESULTS In 819/826 (99%) of the patients, at least one STOPP/START signal was generated using a set of 110 algorithms based on STOPP/START v2 criteria. Overall, 39% of the 5080 signals were accepted by the pharmacotherapy team. There was a high variability in the frequency and the subsequent acceptance of the individual STOPP/START criteria. The acceptance ranged from 2.5 to 75.8% for the top ten most frequently generated STOPP and START signals. The signal to stop a drug without a clinical indication was most frequently generated (28%), with more than half of the signals accepted (54%). No difference in mean acceptance of STOPP versus START signals was found. In multivariate analysis, most patient-related determinants did not predict acceptance, although the acceptance of START signals increased in patients with one or more hospital admissions (+ 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-14.1) or one or more falls in the previous year (+ 7.1; 95% CI 0.7-13.4). A higher number of co-morbidities was associated with lower acceptance of STOPP (- 11.8%; 95% CI - 19.2 to - 4.5) and START (- 11.0%; 95% CI - 19.4 to - 2.6) signals for patients with more than nine and between seven and nine co-morbidities, respectively. For setting-related determinants, the acceptance differed significantly between the participating trial sites. Compared with Switzerland, the acceptance was higher in Ireland (STOPP: + 26.8%; 95% CI 16.8-36.7; START: + 31.1%; 95% CI 18.2-44.0) and in the Netherlands (STOPP: + 14.7%; 95% CI 7.8-21.7). Admission to a surgical ward was positively associated with acceptance of STOPP signals (+ 10.3%; 95% CI 3.8-16.8). CONCLUSION The involvement of an expert team in translating population-based CDSS signals to individual patients is essential, as more than half of the signals for potential overuse, underuse, and misuse were not deemed clinically appropriate in a hospital setting. Patient-related potential determinants were poor predictors of acceptance. Future research investigating factors that affect patients' and physicians' agreement with medication changes recommended by expert teams may provide further insight for implementation in clinical practice.

390,34878686,"Incidence and nature of adverse drug events in paediatric intensive care units: A prospective multicentre study. AIMS The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, nature, preventability and severity of adverse drug events (ADEs) across three paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in England. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study was conducted across three PICUs over a three-month period during 2019. Included patients were aged ≤18 years and stayed in PICU for a minimum of 24 hours. Identification of suspected ADEs was performed by trained PICU pharmacists. A multidisciplinary expert panel assessed causality, preventability and severity of events. RESULTS A total of 302 patients were included and 62 ADEs were confirmed (definite/probable causality). One in six patients experienced one or more ADEs. The estimated incidence of ADEs were 20.5 per 100 patients (95% CI 15.3-27.5) and 16.7 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI 9.3-29.9). The majority of ADEs were judged preventable by the expert panel (36/62, 58.1%). ADEs were commonly involved with medicines prescribing (29/62, 46.8%) and caused temporary patient harm (42/62, 67.7%). Medications for the central nervous system (14/62, 22.6%), infections (13/62, 20.9%) and cardiovascular system (12/62, 19.4%) were commonly implicated with ADEs. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients who stayed in PICU for ≥7 days (OR 6.29, 95% CI 2.42-16.32) were more likely to experience an ADE compared to patients with a stay of 1-6 days. CONCLUSION ADEs are common in English PICUs and most of them may be preventable. There is a strong association between ADE occurrence and duration of PICU stay, which represents a target for remedial interventions. Exploring contributory factors of preventable ADEs is now necessary to inform preventive policies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
391,34878987,"A Smartphone App (AnSim) With Various Types and Forms of Messages Using the Transtheoretical Model for Cardiac Rehabilitation in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease: Development and Usability Study. BACKGROUND Despite strong evidence of clinical benefit, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are currently underutilized and smartphone-based CR strategies are thought to address this unmet need. However, data regarding the detailed process of development are scarce. OBJECTIVE This study focused on the development of a smartphone-based, patient-specific, messaging app for patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS The AnSim app was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team that included cardiologists, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, and rehabilitation doctors and therapists. First, a focus group interview was conducted, and the narratives of the patients were analyzed to identify their needs and preferences. Based on the results, health care experts and clinicians drafted messages into 5 categories: (1) general information regarding cardiovascular health and medications, (2) nutrition, (3) physical activity, (4) destressing, and (5) smoking cessation. In each category, 90 messages were developed according to 3 simplified steps of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change: (1) precontemplation, (2) contemplation and preparation, and (3) action and maintenance. After an internal review and feedback from potential users, a bank of 450 messages was developed. RESULTS The focus interview was conducted with 8 patients with PCI within 1 year, and 450 messages, including various forms of multimedia, were developed based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change in each category. Positive feedback was obtained from the potential users (n=458). The mean Likert scale score was 3.95 (SD 0.39) and 3.91 (SD 0.39) for readability and usefulness, respectively, and several messages were refined based on the feedback. Finally, the patient-specific message delivery system was developed according to the baseline characteristics and stages of behavioral change in each participant. CONCLUSIONS We developed an app (AnSim), which includes a bank of 450 patient-specific messages, that provides various medical information and CR programs regarding coronary heart disease. The detailed process of multidisciplinary collaboration over the course of the study provides a scientific basis for various medical professionals planning smartphone-based clinical research.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

394,34879694,"A qualitative study to explore primary health care practitioners' perceptions and understanding regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has rapidly spread across countries globally, and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In South Africa, more that 1 million cases have been confirmed since case zero was detected in March 2020. South Africa is currently leading in the sub-Saharan African region in terms of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity rates. AIM The aim of this study was to explore primary health care practitioners' perceptions and understanding regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. SETTING The study was conducted at two selected primary health care facilities (a community health centre and satellite clinic) within a low-income rural context in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted to explore and describe perceptions and understanding of primary health care practitioners regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Data were collected from a purposive sample of 15 participants at two different clinics situated in rural KZN, South Africa. Participants comprised of nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, community care givers, social workers and clinical associates. The participants were both men and women who were all above the age of 20. Data were collected through individual, in-depth face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. An audiotape was used to collect data, which were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed manually by thematic analysis following Tech's steps of data analysis. RESULTS Participants reported pre-pandemic and pandemic perceptions of fear, denial, expectancy and a perceived poor preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings also revealed participants' misperceptions regarding the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and unrealistic expectations of occupational compensations for working during the outbreak. CONCLUSION The findings of this study suggest that primary health care practitioners generally have negative perceptions and understanding regarding the pandemic because of misinformation obtained from social media. Interventions to support health care practitioners are necessary to mitigate the potentially negative implications of health practitioners' misconceptions on service delivery and their mental health.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
395,34879702,"Utilization of Generic Cardiovascular Drugs in Medicare's Part D Program. BACKGROUND Generic medications cost less than brand-name medications and are similarly effective, but brand-name medications are still prescribed. We evaluated patterns in generic cardiovascular medication fills and estimated the potential cost savings with increased substitution of generic for brand-name medications. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of cardiovascular therapies using the Medicare Part D database of prescription medications in 2017. We evaluated drug fill patterns for therapies with available brand-name and generic options. We determined the generic substitution ratio and estimated the potential savings with increased generic substitution at the national, state, and clinician level. We compared states with laws related to mandatory pharmacist generic substitution and patient consent for substitution. RESULTS Of ≈$22.9 billion spent on cardiovascular drugs in Medicare Part D prescription programs in 2017, ≈$11.0 billion was spent on medications with both brand-name and generic options. Although only 2.4% of medication fills were for the brand-name choice, they made up 21.2% of total spending. Accounting for estimated brand-name rebates, generic substitution for these medications would save $641 million, including $135 million in costs shouldered by patients. Furthermore, the minority of clinicians with the lowest generic utilization was responsible for a large proportion of the potential cost savings. CONCLUSIONS There are substantial potential cost savings from substituting brand-name medications with generic medications. These savings would be primarily driven by lower use of brand-name therapies by the minority of clinicians who prescribe them at increased rates.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
396,34880952,"Lack of regulation over antibiotic prescription and dispensation: A prospective cohort in a community setting. Background The emergence of bacterial resistance caused health authorities to attempt to implement strict regulations for rational antibiotic prescription. However, supervision is often neglected in low- and middle-income countries, leading to inappropriate administration of antibiotics. The objective of our study is to highlight the lack of monitoring in the community setting of a middle-income country. Material and methods We asked 68 patients presenting to an infectious diseases consultation office to report the antibiotic courses they had taken in the three months preceding their visit. We assessed for treatment indication, molecule choice, dosing and duration, as well as microbial cultures, demographics and specialty of the prescriber. Results Among the 68 patients included in our study, we counted a total of 95 outpatient antibiotic courses, mostly composed of quinolones (36%), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (21%). The prescriber was most commonly a primary care physician, but we reported several cases of auto-medication and dispensation of antibiotics by pharmacists. Only 30% of cases had true indications for antibiotics. Conclusion In sum, our results indicate an evident lack of regulation over the administration of antibiotics.

Aim: Characterize current perceptions, practices, preferences and barriers to integrating pharmacogenomics into patient care at an institution with an established pharmacogenomics clinic. Materials & methods: A 16-item anonymous survey was sent to healthcare professionals practicing at Tampa General Hospital and the University of South Florida Health. Results: Survey participants consisted of nine advanced practice providers, 41 pharmacists and 64 physicians. Majority of survey participants did not feel confident in their ability to interpret and apply pharmacogenomic results. In the past 12 months, 27% of physicians reported ordering a pharmacogenomic test.

398,34881653,"Emergency Contraception Access and Counseling in Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Pharmacies in Georgia.  Background: Emergency contraception (EC) efficacy is dependent on timing of administration. Adequate pharmacy stock information and accurate patient counseling are important to ensure timely access. Objective: This study evaluates pharmacist reported availability and counseling for levonorgestrel (LNG) and ulipristal acetate (UPA), and identifies differences between caller type and pharmacies in metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan areas of Georgia. Methods: This prospective, randomized, telephone-based study included 25% of Georgia community pharmacies, stratified by geographic location. Calls were made by investigators, first posing as a mystery shopper inquiring about EC stock and efficacy, then 3-6 weeks later as a researcher inquiring about EC stock. Analysis utilized descriptive statistics, chi Square, and logistic regression. Results: Of 600 pharmacies, the mystery shopper caller reached 86%: 74% of pharmacists initially discussed LNG, 57.1% had it stocked, more often in metropolitan areas (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.08-2.6). Ulipristal acetate was discussed by 1.9% and reported in-stock < 1%. Of those who discussed window of efficacy, 79% indicated LNG would either not work 4 days after intercourse or they were unsure. The research caller successfully completed a second call for 64% of pharmacies: 57% stocked LNG, 3% stocked UPA, and UPA was more likely to be stocked in metropolitan pharmacies. Conclusion: In Georgia, UPA availability is poor, and nonmetropolitan pharmacies were less likely to stock LNG and UPA. A minority of pharmacists correctly indicated that LNG may work up to 120 hours after intercourse. Strategies are needed to overcome barriers to EC availability in community pharmacies and support pharmacists' EC counseling.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer is increasing in rate globally and is leading cause of death among no communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) after cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of the research focuses on the risk of occupational injury, job stress, mental illness, substance abuse and workplace safety in physicians and nurses. However, fewer studies have investigated the risk of cancer in pharmacists. We compared the matched general population to investigate the risk of cancer in pharmacists in Taiwan. Data were obtained from the Health and Welfare Data Science Center of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. We established a pharmacist group that included 11,568 pharmacists and selected a 4-fold comparison (n = 46,272) for the non-clinics comparison group, frequency being matched by age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score. The pharmacists had a lower but non-significant risk of all cancer (Adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85-1.07) compared with the general population.

A search strategy using key terms was performed in peer-reviewed databases, as well as the grey literature. Additionally, experts from the selected countries were consulted to obtain further information about the practice models in their respective countries. Thirty-six documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Four major pharmacist practice models were identified and formed the focus of the review: (1) the NHS's Medicine Optimisation in Care Homes (MOCH) program from England; (2) the Australian model utilising visiting accredited pharmacists; (3) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) pharmacy services in long-term care from the USA; and (4) the Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program from the USA. Medication reviews were key activities in all models, but each had distinct characteristics in relation to the comprehensiveness, who is eligible, and how frequently residents receive medication review activity. There was heterogeneity in the types of facility-level activities offered by pharmacists, and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these activities in improving quality use of medicines in the aged care setting. This review found that in some models, pharmacists have a limited level of collaboration with other healthcare professionals, emphasising the need to trial innovative models with integrated services and increased collaboration to achieve a holistic patient-centred approach to medication management.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
401,34886927,"Referral of presumptive TB among operators of community medicine outlets.  BACKGROUND: Case detection is an important part of TB control programmes. In 2007, the TB programme in Ghana join the WHO´s public-private partnership with community medicine outlet operators to increase referral of persons with presumptive TB for laboratory investigation. Information on factors likely to influence referral is scarce in Ghana. We assessed these factors among pharmacists and over-the-counter (OTC) medicine sellers.METHODS: In 2019-2020, we conducted computer-assisted telephone interviews among community pharmacists and OTC medicine sellers in the Eastern Region of Ghana. We used a structured questionnaire and collected data on respondents´ sociodemographics and professional characteristics. We used logistic regression to investigate characteristics associated with self-reported referral of presumptive TB cases.RESULTS: Of all respondents who completed the interviews, 68.7% (321/467) reported having ever referred a presumptive TB case and 72.1% (336/466) had received specific training. Associated factors of presumptive TB referral were having received specific training (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-4.9); performing both dispensing and managerial functions (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.5); operating from OTC shop (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.6-23.4) and the availability of a TB laboratory within walking distance (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-9.5).CONCLUSION: Interviewees largely support TB referral. However, a significant proportion does not follow the strategy closely. We recommend more specific TB training courses.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
402,34887187,"Barriers and best practices related to documentation of electronic care plans: A survey of community-based pharmacies in 4 states. BACKGROUND The provision of enhanced services within community-based pharmacy is increasing. However, an opportunity remains to improve efficient documentation of services, and barriers to implementation exist. Electronic care (eCare) planning is the act of using health information technology to submit a pharmacist eCare plan for a patient encounter, similar to a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan note. OBJECTIVE The primary objective was to identify barriers and best practices related to documentation of eCare plans within community-based pharmacies participating in 4 Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Networks (CPESN). METHODS One of two 24-question electronic surveys was distributed to pharmacies in CPESN Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Ohio. Pharmacies submitting fewer than 10 eCare plans in the previous quarter received a survey to assess barriers to implementation; pharmacies submitting 10 or more eCare plans received a survey to assess best practices for implementation. Surveys remained open for 14 days, with a reminder sent on days 7 and 12. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. An independent-samples t test assessed for between-group differences in the overall knowledge. RESULTS A total of 63 responses were received (Barriers = 19; Best Practices = 44). Best Practices pharmacies earned a higher overall knowledge score than Barriers pharmacies (9.26 vs. 7.26 out of 13 points, P = 0.001). Frequently reported barriers were staffing resources (n = 11, 57.9%), perceived time commitment (n = 8, 42.1%), and lack of payment (n = 8, 42.1%). Most Best Practices pharmacies agreed or strongly agreed that they involve pharmacists (n = 36, 81.8%) and student pharmacists (n = 33, 75.5%) in eCare planning processes. Common foci of eCare plans by Best Practice pharmacies were medication synchronization (n = 35, 79.5%), drug therapy problems (n = 29, 65.9%), adherence assessment (n = 28, 63.6%). CONCLUSIONS A difference in knowledge and perceptions exists between pharmacies who regularly eCare plan and those who do not. Observed trends in knowledge, perceptions, barriers, and best practices should be used to create a training to increase eCare planning quality and consistency.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
403,34887188,"Implementation of a novel learning experience in scientific writing, publishing, and peer review into a first year pharmacy practice residency. BACKGROUND Pharmacists with competency in writing, publishing, and peer review are essential to continue advancing the pharmacy profession, but structured training of these skills may vary. OBJECTIVE The authors set out to implement and assess the impact of a structured learning experience into a postgraduate year 1 pharmacy residency training program that provides tangible experience in the processes of scientific writing, publishing, and peer reviewing. METHODS A quarterly pharmacy newsletter process was augmented to include an editorial board that consisted of residency trained pharmacists with varying levels of experience in scientific writing, publishing, and peer reviewing. The process was designed to provide a structured writing learning experience, to reinforce important concepts and terminology, and to simulate the process of submitting a manuscript to a peer-reviewed publication. Impact of the learning experience on quality of article submissions was assessed by comparing first quarter and last quarter writing submission scores for residents between 2017 and 2020. RESULTS A statistically significant difference was observed in both raw scores (27 vs. 42.5 points out of 50 points possible, P < 0.05) and the proportion of pass or fail when comparing writing submission scores from the first quarter of the learning experience to submission scores from the last quarter (25% passing rate vs. 83% passing rate, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION This novel learning experience was successfully integrated into a quarterly pharmacy newsletter and resulted in improved writing scores. This structured writing learning experience can be readily integrated into pharmacy residency training programs, and it provides hands-on training in scientific writing, publishing, and peer review for both residents and preceptors.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
404,34887189,"Description of collaborative, fee-for-service, office-based, pharmacist-directed medical cannabis therapy management service for patients with chronic pain. BACKGROUND Treatment with medical cannabis (MC) in the United States tends to be patient-driven in nature despite evidence that suggests that patients have remarkably poor knowledge on the medical use of this treatment modality. OBJECTIVE To develop and pilot a collaborative, fee-for-service (FFS), office-based, pharmacist-directed MC therapy management (MCTM) service for patients suffering chronic pain. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION A collaborative, FFS, office-based, pharmacist-directed MCTM service where patients are seen after a physician deems them suitable for treatment with MC. The pharmacist designs the initial treatment regimen by selecting a formulation, dose, route, and frequency of administration and then manages ongoing therapy by making regimen changes based on the patient's response, adverse effects, and financial concerns. PRACTICE INNOVATION The creation of a specialized service where a registered MC pharmacist is positioned in a collaborating provider's office and sees patients face-to-face for the provision of MCTM services. EVALUATION METHODS Patient retention, revenue generated, and ability to replicate the service were evaluated. Patient satisfaction was assessed by collecting subjective feedback on the service. RESULTS The pilot site that developed the service has seen 133 patients from 2016 to 2021 and has retained 89% of patients after 5 years of quarterly appointments. Patients appear willing to pay out of pocket for the service, and the revenue generated covers the pharmacist's and collaborating physician's time as well as additional overhead. The service has been replicated at 2 additional sites, and patient feedback has been positive. CONCLUSIONS MCTM is another useful pharmacist service that patients are willing to pay for. MCTM services decrease the collaborating provider's workload while still allowing them to offer their patients personalized treatment with MC. In our experience, the service retains patients, generates enough revenue to cover costs, can be replicated, and is well received by patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
405,34887986,"Community acceptance and willingness to pay for hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines in a developing country: a web-based nationwide study in Nigeria. Introduction some promising COVID-19 vaccines are soon to be available but getting the African community to accept them may be challenging. This study assessed the acceptability and willingness to pay (WTP) for hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines among Nigerians. Methods a cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among the Nigerian populace. A 20-item questionnaire was used to collect responses through Google form which was shared to consenting participants through two social media platforms. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the sociodemographic factors that were predictive of respondents´ willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results six hundred and eighty-nine respondents completed the survey, with 50.5% being females. Exactly 43.3% of respondents reported that they would accept a hypothetical vaccine if it is currently available, 62.1% said they would accept it in the future while 71.1% agreed to accept it if recommended by healthcare providers. A third (31.9%) of respondents accepted the vaccine for their self-protection and half of those not accepting it (51.3%) said they did not want to ""be used as an experiment"". Respondents who were of oldest ages (aOR=0.330, 95% CI: 0.141-0.767, p=0.010), of Christian religion (aOR=3.251, 95% CI: 1.301-8.093, p=0.011), and aware of a possible vaccine being made available (aOR=0.636, 95% CI: 0.440-0.920) were significantly more unwilling to accept the vaccine. The median range of WTP was US$1.2-2.5. Conclusion there is a low acceptance in Nigeria for a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available now, but much higher if it is recommended by a healthcare provider. A high proportion of willing respondents indicated a positive WTP for the vaccine.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
406,34887990,"Cross-sectional survey of knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers and community members toward the Ebola virus disease and antimicrobial resistance pathogens outbreaks in Nigeria. Introduction the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Nigeria has further raised the awareness of health-care workers (HCWs) and community members (MCs) on the threat posed by infectious diseases and the need for improvement on infection control practices. However, awareness of dangers of increasing incidences of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in hospitals and communities remained low. Methods a cross-sectional survey of awareness of 195 HCWs and 265 MCs toward EVD and AMR was conducted through a structured questionnaire. Results majority of HCWs (95.4%) and MCs (82.8%) still have knowledge of EVD´s danger and give reasons like its unique way of killing and unavailability of drugs for their awareness. Only 17.2% of MCs are aware of AMR as a problem, and only 3.4% of MCs and 10.3% of HCWs agreed that AMR is more dangerous than EVD. On the contrary, 76.4% of doctors, 95.1% nurses, 67.9% laboratory scientists, 66.7% pharmacists, 77.4% students and 100% of civil servants, drivers and religious leaders believed that EVD is more horrific and spread faster. They both attributed the rapid awareness of EVD in Nigeria, despite being new at the time of the outbreak, to the seriousness with which stakeholders and the media fought EVD, the gesture AMR is yet to receive. Though both HCWs and MCs agreed that prevention, not treatment is the best option to tackle Ebola like-diseases, but surprisingly, about 37% and 65% of HCWs and MCs respectively, still believe that traditional medicines can be used to treat Ebola related illnesses. Conclusion AMR awareness remains low among MCs and some HCWs when compared with EVD. It is recommended that efforts put in place during EVD outbreak by all stakeholders and the media need to be doubled to increase the knowledge of both HCWs and MCs toward AMR.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
407,34888082,"Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Related to Dietary Supplements among a Group of Palestinian Pharmacists. Objectives The use of dietary supplements (DS) has increased, but due to a lack of related regulations, the prescription of DS depends on pharmacists' knowledge. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to DS among community-based pharmacists. Methods This study followed a cross-sectional design targeting community pharmacists in West Bank, Palestine between September and December 2019. Selected participants filled a self-administered questionnaire regarding their KAP related to DS. The questionnaire contained 15 items: five questions on knowledge, seven on practices and three on attitudes. Results At a 90% response rate, 56.2% of the representative sample was female. The participants' experience was distributed almost equally across the categories of 0-5, 5-10 and over 10 years. Additionally, a majority of the participants were the responsible pharmacist and/or the pharmacy owner. Overall, the participants showed a moderate level of knowledge about DS with a mean score of 3.68 ± 1.1 out of 5; the correct answers ranged from 3.6% to 75.3% of the surveyed participants. The practices with the highest frequencies were as follows: taking DS sometimes (79.9%), taking supplements from well-known brands (56.2%), giving supplements to any patient (55.7%), selling supplements according to the participants' knowledge (74.2%) and providing advice about supplements (73.2%). The questions about the pharmacists' attitudes towards DS market regulation revealed that more than half (52%) of the participants believed that it was suitable. The association between knowledge score and practices was highly significant (P <0.001). Conclusion The study revealed that participants had moderate knowledge about DS. Additionally, knowledge and practices were highly connected.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
408,34888322,"Exploring Factors Associated With the Motivation of Clinical Pharmacists: A Focus on the South African Context.  Introduction: Pharmacy practice in many middle to low-income countries has slowly transitioned from being product-focused to a more patient-focused clinical practice. Lack of motivation is one of the factors contributing to the scarcity of pharmacists in the wards. As little is known about motivation in clinical pharmacists, this study aimed to obtain insight into the quantity and quality of their work motivation and factors associated with it. Methods: Self-determination Theory, used as the framework, describes autonomous motivation as being generated from within or through personal endorsement and controlled motivation as originating from external factors. An online questionnaire including the Academic Motivation Scale to measure autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation, was sent to clinical pharmacy graduates from 2000 to 2020 across South Africa, followed by interviews to explain some results. Independent t-test was used to analyze differences in motivation of clinical pharmacists to perform clinical services based on personal and environmental factors. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed to explain significant quantitative findings. Results: Higher amotivation was found in graduates who are currently not practicing in dedicated clinical pharmacist positions, as well as in graduates who do not receive additional financial benefits for clinical services. We found no significant differences in the work motivation of clinical pharmacists based on their gender, age, current practice setting, work experience and additional training received. The interviews revealed that relatedness and autonomy are the most important factors for clinical pharmacists' work motivation. Discussion: Overall participants had a high mean autonomous motivation, a high mean controlled motivation and low mean amotivation. In line with Self-determination Theory literature, considering the basic psychological needs for relatedness and autonomy could assist with designing interventions, like creating a supportive work environment, to optimize motivation. This could improve professional wellbeing, service implementation and prevent possible adverse events. Future research is necessary to understand barriers and facilitators of clinical pharmacists' work motivation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
409,34888475,"Comparing racial health disparities in pandemics a decade apart: H1N1 and COVID-19. Background and aims The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported disproportionate health disparities with respect to disease for Blacks/African Americans (AAs) compared to Whites in the USA. In this paper, we identify and compare the factors involved in creating these disparities among these populations during the 2009 H1N1 and current COVID-19 pandemics. Methods We included studies describing health disparities towards Blacks/AAs in the USA during the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics. Only observational empirical studies with free full-text availability in English from PubMed, PubMed Central and Google Scholar were included. Results A total of 31 papers were included: 19 pertaining to the H1N1 pandemic and 12 to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative analysis for health disparities resulted in 43 different factors, which were subdivided into nine overarching themes. Discussion The similarities that exist between the two pandemics indicate that there are many neglected issues in American healthcare that need to be addressed. The listed factors have led to disparities in screening and treating for disease resulting in disparities in infection rates, severity of illness and mortality. This calls for a change in healthcare dynamics to improve access to healthcare, remove any form of possible discrimination, and regain the lost trust with the Black/AA communities, repairing historical damage. Conclusions Effective utilisation of social media and faith-based centres to educate patients, implementation of new policies improving access to healthcare, and culture-sensitive education for healthcare providers are suggested to decrease health disparities and improve health outcomes across the USA.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
410,34888983,"Association between a Usual Source of Care and Influenza Vaccination Rates Among Pregnant Women. PURPOSE Pregnant women and infants less than six months of age have a higher risk of complications from influenza. Vaccination is recommended for pregnant women to decrease risk of infection and hospitalizations among both the women themselves and infants. However, vaccination rates remain low in pregnant women. The objective of this study was to determine the association between having a usual source of care and seasonal influenza vaccination rates among women who were pregnant between 2012-2016. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted using pooled data from the 2012-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Frequencies of seasonal influenza vaccinations and other sociodemographic factors were estimated. A multivariable log-binomial regression model was used to examine the association between having a usual source of care and seasonal influenza vaccination rates. RESULTS The weighted influenza vaccination rate among pregnant women was 54.5%. About one third did not have a usual source of care. The adjusted prevalence ratio of receiving an influenza vaccine for pregnant women without a usual source of care was 0.76 (95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.98). The top three main reasons for not having a usual source of care were being seldom or never sick (55.7%), not having health insurance (10.6%), and having recently moved to an area (9.9%). CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women without a usual source of care had significantly lower probability of being vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Improving access to care through greater insurance coverage, addressing cost barriers, and providing patient education may help improve vaccination rates in this population.

411,34889271,"Attitudes towards, knowledge about, and confidence to prescribe antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis among healthcare providers in Thailand. ABSTRACT HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (HIV-PrEP) is an effective method for preventing HIV transmission, and it is recommended in several international guidelines. Perceptions and knowledge about HIV-PrEP prescription among healthcare providers have not been investigated in Thailand where HIV-PrEP is a novel healthcare topic. The objective of study was to determine healthcare providers' attitudes towards, knowledge about, and confidence to prescribe HIV-PrEP in Thailand.A questionnaire was administered to Thai healthcare providers during May 1, 2017 to September 5, 2018.Of the 500 questionnaires that were distributed, 460 were returned (92%). Respondents included 336 physicians (48 infectious disease [ID] physicians, 288 non-ID physicians) and 124 non-physicians (70 nurses, 35 pharmacists, and 19 others). Eighty one percent of respondents had a positive attitude towards HIV-PrEP. Multivariate analysis revealed being a non-ID physician, having prior knowledge about HIV-PrEP, believing that HIV-PrEP can reduce the number of new patients, and believing that HIV-PrEP is not associated with a higher incidence of other sexually transmitted infections were all factors significantly associated with having a positive attitude towards HIV-PrEP. The issue of most concern to respondents who had a negative attitude toward HIV-PrEP was poor patient adherence to antiviral medications. Only 57% of respondents had confidence to prescribe HIV-PrEP. Factors associated with confidence to prescribe HIV-PrEP included being an ID physician, believing that HIV-PrEP can reduce the number of new patients, believing in the safety of antiviral medications, and believing that HIV-PrEP is not associated with increased development of HIV drug resistance. The results of HIV-PrEP knowledge testing (8 questions) were categorized into good score (≥7/8) and fair score (≤6/8). Fifty five percent of participants had a good score result. Using multivariate analysis, the factors associated with a good score result were ID physician, having HIV-PrEP prescription experience, and believing that HIV-PrEP can reduce the number of new patients.Most Thai healthcare providers (81%) reported having a positive attitude towards HIV-PrEP. Successful HIV-PrEP implementation in Thailand will require steps to mitigate the described barriers, and training for healthcare providers, which will strengthen knowledge and improve both experience with and confidence to prescribe HIV-PrEP.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
412,34889275,"Development of a simple method for measuring tedizolid concentration in human serum using HPLC with a fluorescent detector. ABSTRACT The objective of the present study was to develop a method to measure tedizolid (TZD) concentration for studying target concentration intervention, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TZD. We established a high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detector assay to measure the TZD concentration in serum for clinical application. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a 5 μm octadecyl silane hypersil column 150 mm × 4.6 mm. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 M phosphoric acid and methanol (60:40, pH 7.0). Detection was performed at 300 nm and 340 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The average retention times of TZD and the internal standard were 12.9 and 8.8 min, respectively. High linearity was exhibited over a concentration range of 0.025 to 10.0 μg/mL for TZD (R2 > 0.999). The intra- and inter-assay accuracies of TZD were 99.2% to 107.0% and 99.2% to 107.7%, respectively. The lower limit of quantitation and the lower limit of detection for TZD measurement were 0.025 and 0.01 μg/mL, respectively. The extraction recoveries of TZD were 100.4% to 114.1%.The high-performance liquid chromatography method developed in this study could separate the analytes with a single eluent (isocratic system), within a total run time of 15 min. Both TZD and IS were well separated, without interference from the peaks. Sharp peaks were observed in the chromatograms; problems such as double peaks, shoulder peaks, and broadened peaks were not observed. The proposed method showed acceptable analytical performance and could be used to evaluate serum TZD concentrations in patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
413,34893442,"Factors influencing series completion rates of recombinant herpes zoster vaccine in the United States: A retrospective pharmacy and medical claims analysis. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Vaccination against herpes zoster (HZ) is an effective strategy in protecting the population against consequences of varicella zoster virus reactivation. Optimal immunogenicity with recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) relies on completion of the 2-dose series within 2-6 months from the first dose. The objectives of this study were to estimate RZV completion rates and adherence with the recommended administration schedule in the general United States population aged at least 50 years and to evaluate factors influencing completion rates. METHODS Longitudinal, open-source pharmacy and medical claims databases were analyzed for adults aged at least 50 years with a first RZV prescription filled between October 2017 and September 2019. The data were linked to Experian Marketing Services Consumer View data to obtain information regarding race. Completion rates and adherence were calculated overall and stratified according to claim source, age class, sex, and payer type. Logistic regression models were built for each subpopulation of interest to identify factors correlating with completion rates. RESULTS Overall, cumulative completion rates were 70.41% and 81.80% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Median time to second dose was approximately 4 months (4.08-5.13 months) and adherence 67.62%. Completion rates were lower in the medical claims database compared with the pharmacy claims database (48.98% vs. 73.23% at 6 months). Regression models confirmed that pharmacy claim was an independent factor for higher completion rates, while African American race and Medicaid status were associated with lower completion rates. Most comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, were associated with lower completion rates. CONCLUSION Pharmacists contribute substantially to the overall high RZV completion rates in the United States. However, completion rates can be improved, especially in people receiving their first RZV dose at a physician's office. Future strategies should aim at lowering barriers to completing vaccination series in African Americans, Medicaid beneficiaries, and people with comorbidities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
414,34893443,"A social media microinfluencer intervention to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine hesitancy in underserved Tennessee communities: A protocol paper. BACKGROUND Central to effective public health policy and practice is the trust between the population served and the governmental body leading health efforts, but that trust has eroded in the years preceding the pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy among adults is also a growing concern across the United States. Recent data suggest that the trustworthiness of information about the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine was a larger concern than the vaccine's adverse effects or risks. OBJECTIVE This study aims to describe the methods used to create a public health microinfluencer social media vaccine confidence campaign for the COVID-19 vaccine in underserved Tennessee communities. A secondary objective is to describe how the Social-Ecological Model (SEM) and Social Cognitive Theory may address vaccine hesitancy using community pharmacies. METHODS In late 2020, 50 independent community pharmacies in underserved communities across Tennessee were involved in a public health project with the State of Tennessee Department of Health and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Pharmacy. The project involved a 3-pronged, pharmacy-based COVID-19 vaccination outreach project, including (1) social media messaging (i.e., microinfluencer approach), (2) community partner collaboration, and (3) in-pharmacy promotion. Quantitative and qualitative data will assess the quality and effectiveness of the program. Social media outcomes will also be assessed to measure the impact of the microinfluencer social media training. RESULTS Project implementation is planned for 6 months (January 2021 to June 2021) after an initial month of planning by the research team (December 2020) and preceding several months of assessment (July 2021 and beyond). CONCLUSIONS Novel, theory-based approaches will be necessary to improve vaccine confidence. One approach to promoting public health, derived from the SEM, may be to use trusted microinfluencers on social media platforms, such as local community pharmacists and community leaders.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the impact of telehealth-based simulations on student social and emotional development.Methods. First year pharmacy students enrolled in a professional skills course were eligible to participate in the study. Before and after the course, students completed the personal-interpersonal competence assessment which codes onto eight subcategories: situation monitoring, inspire others, intimacy, awareness of one's aptitude, initiative to pursue leadership, empathy, sociability, and awareness of one's emotions. Students participated in seven telehealth-based simulations. Prior to each simulation, students watched a role-modeling video highlighting social and emotional competence techniques utilized by a pharmacist during a consultation. Students then participated in simulated consultations which occurred in Zoom breakout rooms. Each student completed one consult while a teaching assistant (TA) completed a rubric derived from the personal-interpersonal competence assessment. TAs then provided formative feedback related to the student's social and emotional competence. At the semester midpoint, students completed a video log reflecting on their social and emotional development. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the personal-interpersonal competence assessment and TA scores. Qualitative analysis was utilized for the video logs.Results. At the end of the course, improvement was noted on all factors of the personal-interpersonal competence assessment. TA assessments showed significant improvement over the semester with highest improvement noted on the inspiration and situation monitoring subcategories. On the video log, 80% of students noted improvements in their consideration of others.Conclusion. These findings suggest value in using role-modeling, telehealth-based simulations, and TA feedback on pharmacy student social and emotional development.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
416,34893466,"Evaluating Pharmacy Faculty's Awareness of Teaching and Learning Myths and Misconceptions.  Objective To assess pharmacy faculty's knowledge of prominent and prevalent teaching and learning myths and misconceptions and evidence-based strategies prior to training.Methods Participants completed a baseline assessment containing 16 true/false knowledge questions over teaching and learning misconceptions (10) and myths (6), one open-ended application question, and four participant demographic questions including years of experience in pharmacy academia, the focus of their institution (teaching or research), the number of education meetings attended, and if they had formal training in education. After completing the baseline assessment of the top 16 misconceptions and myths, faculty were trained on the top 10 evidence-based teaching and learning strategies. At session completion, faculty were provided the assessment answers and scored their original responses.Results Results from the survey revealed that most responders (56%) had been in academics between one and 10 years and attended two to 10 education meetings (62%). The majority of participants worked at teaching-intensive universities (56%) and most had no formal training in teaching (65%). The average score on the assessment was 43% for the myths section versus 70% for the misconceptions section (p<.001). Faculty participants were overconfident in their predictions (Predicted = 74%, Actual = 60%). Faculty demographics did not influence the assessment scores.Conclusion Pharmacy faculty may not know which teaching and learning strategies are evidence-based and which are myths or misconceptions. In addition, they are likely to be overconfident in their knowledge of this evidence. This provides opportunity for faculty development in these areas.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

419,34895661,"Team feedback: A missing piece of the interprofessional education puzzle. INTRODUCTION The ambulatory care practice model has long embraced interprofessional collaboration, well before it was formalized by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative. Establishing a mechanism to gather insight from other members of the interprofessional team may facilitate further development of interprofessional education (IPE). COMMENTARY There is limited evidence investigating non-pharmacy trainees and medical provider perceptions of advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) student involvement in IPE. Most available evidence evaluates the satisfaction of non-pharmacy trainees and other health care professionals with APPE student recommendations. IMPLICATIONS Emphasis on IPE, such as formalizing feedback from other health care professionals during experiential rotations, may assist preceptors in adapting interactions, strengthening interprofessional collaborations, and ensuring that students are valued team members who contribute to providing quality patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
420,34895662,"The catalyst for change in teaching and assessing virtual laboratory skills. INTRODUCTION Historically, pharmacy skills laboratory courses have primarily been delivered utilizing in-person instruction; however, changes in methods of healthcare delivery serve as a catalyst to consider best practices for virtual learning in the skills laboratory setting. PERSPECTIVE Shifting to a virtual delivery method is valuable for future curriculum and course development. Three specific delivery methods including flipped classroom, virtual formative simulations, and telehealth objective structured clinical examinations, provide examples of the opportunities and challenges instructors may encounter when shifting delivery methods. Furthermore, the examples illuminate the need to deliberately incorporate virtual technology into pharmacy skills laboratory courses to ensure students are practice-ready for the changing methods of delivery in the healthcare environment. IMPLICATIONS Skills laboratory instructors and students must reimagine how patient care skills can be taught and assessed. It is imperative to reassess priorities and adapt skills-based courses to incorporate the virtual learning environment to prepare student pharmacists for future practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
421,34895664,"Predictors of student pharmacist success on an advanced pharmacy practice experience-readiness performance-based assessment. INTRODUCTION The study objective was determining the relationship of certain predictor variables with student performance on an advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE)-readiness performance-based assessment (PBA) in the third professional year (P3). METHODS This retrospective study aimed to identify if student predictors and/or curricular-related predictor variables correlate with student performance on a patient interview and documentation activity (PIDA), an APPE-readiness assessment. Student predictors included Pharmacy College Admission Test score, pre-pharmacy cumulative grade point average (GPA), end of first professional year (P1) GPA, end of second professional year GPA, end of fall P3 GPA, and elective Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP) score. Curricular-related predictor variables comprised specific activities with emphasis on patient care skill development in P1 through P3 years. Adjusted and unadjusted linear regression models assessed correlations between PIDA score and student predictors as well as curricular variables. RESULTS Students from the Classes of 2018 through 2020 at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Pharmacy (N = 231) were included. Two student predictors, P3 GPA and PPCP elective score, showed statistically significant correlations with PIDA performance. One curriculum-related variable, P3 activity with an emphasis on medication reconciliation, demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with student performance on the PIDA. CONCLUSIONS Student performance on a cumulative PBA may be predictive from prior curricular learning experiences that assess similar patient care skills. The predictive impact of the elective PPCP score on a PBA needs additional research. Recent implementation of a new curriculum may lead to identification of other predictors of student success on PBAs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION We sought to compare student performance on acute care advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) pre- and post-incorporation of mock acute care patient simulations into the curriculum. METHODS A series of mock acute care APPE simulations (MACAS) were developed and incorporated into Touro University California College of Pharmacy curriculum for first- and second-year pharmacy students. Results for student performance on Acute Care I and Acute Care II APPEs were collected for students who received none, one year, or two years of the MACAS. Student admission characteristics and didactic academic performance (grade point average [GPA]) were also gathered. Student characteristics and APPE performance were compared across cohorts of students who received none, one year, and two years of MACAS. Multivariate models were created to measure the impact of the MACAS while controlling for student characteristics. RESULTS The final cohort included 394 students. In unadjusted analyses, students with one or two years of MACAS received significantly higher preceptor acute care APPE evaluations for communication, professionalism, and patient scores vs. students who received no MACAS. In multivariate models controlling for age, gender, and undergraduate GPA, one year of MACAS increased student acute care APPE communication, professionalism, and patient care scores, relative to no MACAS. Similar increases in acute care APPE scores were seen for students who received two years of MACAS. CONCLUSIONS MACAs significantly improved acute care APPE scores relative to students with no MACAS. This improvement in acute care APPEs occurred after students received a single year of MACAS.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
423,34895666,"Mid-fidelity manikins improve first-year pharmacy students' confidence and accuracy with performing physical assessment. INTRODUCTION As clinical roles for pharmacists expand, effective physical assessment training for pharmacy students is essential. The study objective was to determine whether doctor of pharmacy students taught physical assessment using mid-fidelity manikins improved in confidence and accuracy. Long-term retention of skills was also measured. METHODS First-year (P1) pharmacy students were enrolled in a case-based course over two semesters between August 2018 and May 2019. Manikins were incorporated into the fall semester course for students to perform physical assessment as part of the individual case workup process. Students completed surveys before and after the course to evaluate differences in their confidence and accuracy with detecting normal vs. abnormal vital signs. After 21 weeks of no manikin exposure, students were again surveyed and assessed to evaluate long-term retention of physical assessment skills. RESULTS Fifty-six students were included. Student confidence in assessing heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and lung sounds improved significantly between pre-exposure and post-exposure (34%, 39%, and 71% improvement, respectively), and accuracy in assessing BP and lung sounds improved significantly between pre-exposure and post-exposure (28% and 23% improvement, respectively). Confidence and accuracy were maintained throughout the study including follow-up.

424,34895668,"Experiencing a virtual patient to practice patient counselling skills. INTRODUCTION Virtual patients (VPs) are a safe and standardised method of simulating clinical environments but few studies have explored health care professional's experiences of learning via a VP. This study explored how users experienced and used a VP that aimed to teach the user to deliver non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant patient education. METHODS The study used semi-structured interviews with pharmacists and pre-registration trainees from a wider research study. Interview topics were based on key areas concerning VP use. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim before being analysed using the framework approach to thematic analysis. Ethical approval was granted by Keele University. RESULTS There was variation in the type and nature of use of the VP and in the reported learning, which included reinforcement of knowledge, an opportunity to promote reflection, and acquisition and application of knowledge to clinical, patient-facing interactions. The VP was seen as an adjunct to other education and training. The majority of users indicated that they used the VP more than once. Some users seemed to have gamified their learning with a drive to achieve perfect feedback rather than true engagement with the learning, whereas for others the learning appeared to be deep with a reflective focus. CONCLUSIONS The VP offered an educational use as experiential learning, although the users experienced the VP differently; commonly the VP facilitated learning via reinforcement of pre-existing knowledge. The users reported that the VP had value as an adjunct to other education and training resources.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
425,34895669,"Construction and evaluation of an online module addressing counseling patients with diabetes observing religious fasting. INTRODUCTION Little research has been conducted on training students of different health professions to deliver culturally appropriate care to patients observing religious fasting. This study aimed to formulate an online educational module on caring for patients with diabetes observing religious fasting and evaluate the module's impact. METHODS Third-year doctor of pharmacy students participated in an online module at the end of their core pharmacist-patient communication class. The module involved discussions and case scenarios addressing Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu patients with diabetes considering fasting. Students were provided with Ramadan Communication (RAMCOM), a tool designed to facilitate counseling of patients on religious fasting and were encouraged to use principles of motivational interviewing in addressing cases. A 13-item questionnaire was administered before and after the module. Answers provided on an open-ended item addressing students' experiences with the module were analyzed qualitatively using conventional content analysis. RESULTS Of 140 students taking the class, all students completed the module and 135 completed both questionnaires. The module elicited a statistically significant improvement in confidence across all 13 survey items. The computed aggregate score increased from 2.65 (0.56) to 3.66 (0.50) (P < .001), with 71% of students finding the module to be useful or extremely useful.

INTRODUCTION This study describes content on transgender care taught in a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) course and evaluates students' confidence and knowledge of providing care for transgender people. It also examines what pharmacy students want to learn about providing care to transgender people. METHODS Three hours of transgender patient care content was integrated into a pharmacy course that focused on therapeutics of special populations. Students completed an electronic survey before and after the class sessions to identify changes in their confidence in caring for transgender patients. The pre-class survey inquired about what the students were hoping to learn. The post-class survey asked students what was missing from this session that they would have liked to learn. Knowledge regarding transgender care was assessed through a multiple-choice examination. RESULTS Students reported interest in improving communication skills, learning terminology/vocabulary preferred by transgender people, and understanding population-specific challenges faced by transgender patients. Students reported they would have liked additional information about the transition, being transgender, and local resources available. Student confidence in asking about patient pronouns and counseling on effects of medications for gender transition were both significantly increased from the pre-class survey to post-class survey. Students demonstrated proficiency toward the learning objectives, with a 92.4% average on the examination questions on transgender care. CONCLUSIONS Student pharmacists are interested in learning skills to provide care to transgender patients.

427,34895671,"Preparing student pharmacists to care for patients exposed to intimate partner violence. INTRODUCTION Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health problem. Little is known about pharmacists' IPV knowledge and awareness. This study assessed student pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of IPV and examined the impact of a brief curricular unit on these factors. METHODS The Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey was adapted for use with student pharmacists and administered at two pharmacy schools, one private (n = 88) and one public institution (n = 104). Students at one institution were exposed to a curricular unit on IPV tailored for pharmacy practice and completed a post-assessment. RESULTS Students at both institutions had low levels of IPV-related knowledge, answering <60% of items correctly. Students reported low levels of perceived knowledge and preparation. After exposure to the educational intervention (n = 60), knowledge scores increased on a matched post-assessment. Students across both institutions (n = 29) provided comments indicating that they believed IPV is an important issue, that this topic was novel and that pharmacists should address IPV, that pharmacists should be trained on IPV and a desire for training, and that there are barriers to addressing IPV in the pharmacy setting.

428,34895672,"Effect of death and dying elective on student empathy and attitudes toward mortality. INTRODUCTION Pharmacy graduates should be equipped for one inevitable aspect of health care, mortality, yet only 10% of United States pharmacy curricula courses cover end-of-life (EoL) with limited evidence of effectiveness. This study's objective was to evaluate the impact of an EoL elective on student pharmacists' empathy and attitudes toward mortality and caring for terminally ill persons. METHODS First- through third-year student pharmacists enrolled in an EoL elective. Students completed pre- and post-course surveys on self-perceptions of empathy and mortality. Surveys included the following: Kiersma-Chen Empathy Scale (KCES), which assesses empathy of pharmacy and nursing students; revised Collett-Lester Fear of Death and Dying Scale (CL-FODS), which measures fear related to death; and Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale Form B (FATCOD-B), which measures health care professionals' attitudes toward EoL care. Anonymous identifiers were used to link pre- and post-course surveys and were collected with an online survey software. Data were analyzed using two-sided paired t-tests. RESULTS Twenty-seven student pharmacists completed the elective. The change in overall mean scores for KCES, CL-FODS, and FATCOD-B correlated with increased empathy, reduced fear of death, and increased positive attitudes toward caring for terminal patients (KCES pre-course = 86.15 vs. post-course = 90.37; CL-FODS pre-course = 93.70 vs. post-course = 75.15; FATCOD-B pre-course = 115.89 vs. post-course = 124.04). CONCLUSIONS After the EoL elective, student empathy and attitudes toward mortality and caring for terminally ill persons improved.

429,34895673,"Barriers to mental health care and stigma perception in doctor of pharmacy students across the United States. INTRODUCTION Pharmacy students are significantly less likely than medical students to seek on-campus mental health services, though barriers are not well known. This study's objective is to expand on perceived barriers to seeking care for mental health concerns among doctor of pharmacy students in the United States. METHODS An institutional review board-exempt, online survey was disseminated to eight pharmacy programs' students assessing mental health barriers to care, resource interest, attitudes towards treatment, and stigma. Quantitative data were analyzed aggregately and by gender, program type, employment status, and education year. Free-text response analysis used thematic coding. RESULTS Common barriers to care included lack of time (20.2%), financial support or resources (13.2%), and preferring to solve the issue independently (13.2%). About half agreed their programs had sufficient resources to support mental health (58.4%). Suggested resources included on-site counselors (14.5%), pet therapy (13.4%), and wellness activities (12.3%). Students reported high rates of perceived internal stigma, yet low rates of stigma towards others. No significant differences were found among employment status or program type, but first-year students had more positive attitudes towards mental health treatment. Females were significantly more likely to agree mental health treatment was effective and less likely to view someone differently who received treatment. CONCLUSIONS Common barriers to care included lack of time, finances or resources, and concerns of being viewed differently. Additionally, substantial stigma exists, particularly public perception and concern for negative impact on future opportunities. Programs should take initiative to understand students' needs and interest in support services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

434,34895678,"Combining simulated academic detailing with naloxone training to prepare student pharmacists for opioid risk mitigation strategies. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Academic detailing (AD) is an educational outreach intervention designed to provide clinicians with current evidenced-based education to improve patient care and is effective in mitigating opioid risks. Student pharmacists' abilities to apply naloxone training can benefit from concomitant AD training by highlighting skills needed to effectively assess patient and provider needs and handle objections in a non-biased, evidence-supported manner while reinforcing the application of naloxone administration. Most states have a standing order for pharmacist prescribed naloxone. School of pharmacy clinical science faculty sought to create a combined educational activity teaching naloxone AD in conjunction with hands-on naloxone training to better prepare students to apply the standing order in their future careers. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Students in an accelerated pharmacy program applied their AD skills during pharmaceutical skills laboratory activities, emphasizing the use of naloxone administration under the standing order. Students then demonstrated their ability to administer naloxone to a ""patient"" who experienced an emergency after opioid use. FINDINGS While many schools of pharmacy offer either naloxone or AD training to students, none were identified that offered both trainings combined for use with mitigation strategies for opioid management. SUMMARY The combination of simulated AD with naloxone administration training was designed as a unique opportunity to foster naloxone education and enhance student understanding and demonstration of naloxone administration. School of pharmacy programs should recognize the opportunity to combine these activities to prepare students for application of statewide naloxone standing orders.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

With today's complex health care system, there is also a need for more intentional and seamless blending, characterizing what we propose as ""high-level curricular integration"" (i.e. intentional ""weaving"" of multiple disciplines to form a coherent whole). Despite accreditors' recommendations, the practical definition and implementation guidelines of high-level curricular integration are not clear. We aimed to describe high-level curricular integration practices in pharmacy schools by systematically reviewing the literature addressing four elements of high-level curricular integration. These were (1) organizational thread, (2) pedagogies, (3) evaluation strategies, and (4) barriers. METHODS A PRISMA-guided (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) literature search strategy was conducted to examine the scientific literature. Inclusion criteria were English written literature related to one or more of the four elements of high-level curricular integration in pharmacy schools. RESULTS After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, 28 articles were included. The most used organizational thread was disease-oriented (n = 8, 28.5%), and the most reported pedagogy was case studies (n = 11, 39%).

438,34895842,"Using the behavior change wheel to link published deprescribing strategies to identified local primary healthcare needs. BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is a major global problem. Evidence in primary care shows deprescribing can be beneficial. Behaviour change theories such as the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) can help develop successful implementation of deprescribing initiatives. OBJECTIVES To link locally identified deprescribing influencers with components of successfully trialed deprescribing strategies, with the aim of informing the development of local deprescribing initiatives. METHODS Two background studies were completed. A qualitative study of interviews and focus groups identified influencers of deprescribing from local primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. Transcripts were coded using the TDF and mapped to the Intervention Functions of the BCW. A scoping review identified studies that investigated primary care deprescribing strategies, which were mapped to the BCW Intervention Functions and the Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs). For this analysis, six main TDF domains from the qualitative study were linked to the BCTs identified in the scoping review through the Intervention Functions of the BCW. RESULTS Within the BCW component Capability, one TDF domain identified in the qualitative study, Memory, Attention and Decision Process, was linked to strategies like academic detailing from the scoping review. For the Opportunity component, two TDF domains, Social Influences and Environmental Context and Resources, were linked to strategies such as pharmacist medication reviews, providing patient information leaflets, and evidence-based deprescribing tools. For the Motivation component, three TDF domains, Social/Professional Role and Identity, Intentions, and Beliefs about Consequences, were linked to strategies such as sending deprescribing information to prescribers, using tools to identify eligible patients, and having patients report adverse events of medications. CONCLUSIONS This analysis identified deprescribing strategies that can be used to address influencers related to behaviour change from the perspective of primary care providers, and to assist with future deprescribing initiative development and implementation in the local context.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
439,34896014,"Integration of clinical pharmacists into a heart failure clinic within a safety-net hospital. BACKGROUND Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) requires timely initiation and up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). In safety-net hospitals (SNHs), limited health care staff and resources make achievement of optimal medical therapy challenging. Recent studies have shown that medication titration performed by clinical pharmacists can improve outcomes in ambulatory management of HFrEF; however, the impact of these services within an SNH remains unknown. OBJECTIVE Determine the impact of integrating clinical pharmacists into a heart failure (HF) clinic on initiation and titration of GDMT within an SNH. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF treated in an ambulatory HF medication titration clinic within an SNH before and after clinical pharmacist integration. Primary outcomes included dose optimization rates of GDMT, time between clinic visits, and time to optimization of GDMT. Exploratory secondary outcomes were all-cause, HF, and cardiovascular acute care service utilization and all-cause, HF, and cardiovascular mortality before and after clinical pharmacist integration up to 6 months after initial clinic visit. RESULTS A total of 153 patients with HFrEF were treated. Baseline characteristics in the pre- and postintervention groups were comparable. After clinical pharmacist integration, there was a statistically significant improvement in optimization of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor or hydralazine-nitrate equivalent (82% vs. 94%, P = 0.02). Dose optimization rates of beta-blockers (90% vs. 83%, P = 0.22) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (57% vs. 57%, P > 0.99) were unchanged. There was a statistically significant reduction in mean time between clinic visits (26 vs. 14 days, P < 0.001) and in mean time to optimization of GDMT (88 vs. 45 days, P = 0.002).

We recruited physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, etc. who primarily worked in an ICU. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a qualitative focus group/interview using a phenomenological approach. MBI subscales for emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and lack of personal accomplishment were calculated. Emergent shared themes contributing to burnout were identified from qualitative interviews. RESULTS Fifty-eight providers (26 physicians, 22 nurses, 6 respiratory therapists, 3 pharmacists, and 1 case manager) participated. Ten (17.9%) participants described their burnout as moderate to high. However, participants scored moderate or high levels across the 3 MBI subscales (emotional exhaustion - 71.4%, depersonalization - 53.6%, and lack of personal achievement -53.6%). Drivers of burnout aligned with three core themes: patient factors, team dynamics, and hospital culture. Individual drivers included medically futile cases, difficult families, contagiousness of burnout, lack of respect between team members, the increasing burden of administrative/regulatory requirements at the cost of time with patients, lack of recognition from hospital leadership, and technology. All were highly interconnected across the three larger domains. Despite differences in MBI scores, most provider-types described very similar drivers of burnout. INTERPRETATIONS High levels of burnout were identified through the MBI, but participants did not self-report high levels of burnout suggesting a lack of awareness. Drivers of burnout were highly interconnected, but factors related to team-dynamics and hospital culture were most prominent and shared across provider-types. The shared drivers of burnout across multiple provider-types highlights the need for interventions focused on team and system-level drivers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
441,34896303,"Impact of a clinical pharmacist in a multidisciplinary consultation on the switch to a biosimilar for inflammatory rheumatic diseases. OBJECTIVE Despite several studies proving the efficacy and safety of biosimilars compared with original drugs, switching to a biosimilar remains challenging when the decision is at the discretion of physicians with mandatory consent from patients. Educating patients about biosimilars seems important to increase the prescription rate of biosimilars. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a clinical pharmacist consultation on the switch to and retention rate of a biosimilar for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. METHODS This retrospective study compared 2 groups of adult patients receiving (intervention) or not (control) a consultation with a pharmacist right before the rheumatologist consultation. The primary outcome was the frequency of patients who switched to a biosimilar at the end of the rheumatologist visit. RESULTS We analysed 141 patients (50% women, 50±15 years old, on original adalimumab (62%) or etanercept (38%)) who had never used biosimilars: 85 in the intervention group and 56 in the control group. The switch rate to a biosimilar significantly differed between the groups: 69.4% versus 41.1% in the intervention group versus the control group respectively (p<0.01). After a 1-year follow-up period, 72.5% versus 81.3% of patients who switched were still on biosimilar in the intervention versus control group respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the positive impact of a pharmacist consultation before the physician's one on switching to a biosimilar, but more studies are needed to assess the impact of this pharmacist consultation on preventing the nocebo effect and therefore on improving the retention rate of biosimilars.",1,1,0,0,0,Impact on patient outcome not clearly described.,,,,,,,,,
442,34896379,"[Quality Management Of The Experimental Health Products Circuit In Hospital Pharmacies: National Inventory And Proposed Standardised Tools]. OBJECTIVES Carry out a national inventory of the current situation regarding the quality management of the investigational health products circuit, to develop adapted standardised tools. METHODS A survey of 76 questions, developed by a regional working group, was conducted among clinical research pharmacists in French facilities. Tools were developed to meet the identified needs and validated by participating pharmacists, using the Delphi method. The consensus was defined by achieving a score above 80% on relevance, clarity and evaluability. RESULTS Among 94 pharmacists participating in the survey, 88 were interested in standardised tools. The score for the implementation of a quality approach depended on the type of health facility (p<0.0005) and increased with the number of active trials (p<0.0005). All nine proposed tools were useful for over two thirds of pharmacists, but the self-assessment and audit grids have been prioritised. Indeed, only 26% of pharmacies carried out a prior risk assessment and 14% carried out internal audits. The review of both grids led to a consensus on 89% and 97% of the criteria respectively. The validated grids include 62 and 72 criteria respectively. DISCUSSION The quality approach of the investigational health products circuit is heterogeneous in the participating centres, with a strong need for standardised tools. The two grids are relevant tools developed by and for professionals. CONCLUSION The tools developed will enable to optimise the quality approach by identifying the non-conformities of the investigational health products circuit.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
443,34897213,"A Single Institution Analysis of Targeted Colorectal Surgery Enhanced Recovery Pathway Strategies That Decrease Readmissions. BACKGROUND Decreasing readmissions is an important quality improvement strategy. Targeted interventions that effectively decrease readmissions have not been fully investigated and standardized. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess effectiveness of interventions designed to decrease readmissions after colorectal surgery. DESIGN This was a retrospective comparison of patients before and after implementation of interventions. SETTING This study was conducted at a single institution dedicated enhanced recovery pathway colorectal surgery service. PATIENTS The study group received quality review interventions that were designed to decrease readmissions: preadmission class upgrades, a mobile phone app, a pharmacist-led pain management strategy, and an early post-discharge clinic. The control group was comprised of enhanced recovery patients prior to the interventions. Propensity-score weighting was used to adjust patient characteristics and predictors for imbalances. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary outcome was 30-day readmissions. Secondary outcomes included emergency department visits. RESULTS There were 1052 patients in the pre-intervention and 668 patients in the post-intervention group. After propensity-score weighting, the post-intervention cohort had a significantly lower readmission rate (9.98% vs 17.82%, p < 0.001) and emergency department visit rate (14.58% vs 23.15%, p < 0.001) than the pre-intervention group, and surgical site infection type I/II was significantly decreased as a readmission diagnosis (9.46% vs 2.43%, p = 0.043). Median time to readmission was 6 [IQR 3, 11] days in the pre-intervention group and 8 [3, 17] days in the post-intervention group (p = 0.21). Ileus, acute kidney injury, and surgical site infection type III were common reasons for readmissions and emergency department visits. LIMITATIONS Single institution study may not be generalizable. CONCLUSION Readmission bundles composed of targeted interventions are associated with a decrease in readmissions and emergency department visits after enhanced recovery colorectal surgery. Bundle composition may be institution dependent. Further study and refinement of bundle components are required as next step quality metric improvement.

Background Kidney disease affects absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medicines and their metabolites. Therefore, when prescribing medicines for patients with kidney disease, dose adjustment is an accepted standard of practice. Objective This study aimed to assess medicine dose adjustment practice and associated factors among adult patients with renal impairment admitted to medical wards at Amhara region referral hospitals. Method Multicenter, institution-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from March 28, 2020, to August 30, 2020. The data was collected by using a pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and transferred into SPSS version 25 for further data processing and analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were computed. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were fitted to identify factors associated with dose adjustment practice. A 95% confidence interval and a p value less than 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. Result Among 815 medicines' prescriptions that needed dose adjustment, 417 (51.2%) of them were dosed inappropriately. Number of medicines, number of comorbidities, and being unemployed were significantly associated with inappropriate dose adjustment. Conclusion Our study revealed that there was a considerable rate of inappropriate dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. Training for health care providers, use of guidelines, and communication with clinical pharmacists should be encouraged for good prescription practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
446,34900910,"Pharmacist's Perspectives on Administering a COVID-19 Vaccine in Community Pharmacies in Four Balkan Countries.  Community pharmacists expanded their roles and engaged in vaccination services in many countries around the world, but not in Balkan countries. This research aimed to assess the perceptions of pharmacists on involvement in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine administration in four Balkan countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia). A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire that was distributed to community pharmacists across these countries between February and March 2021. A total of 636 community pharmacists were included in the analysis of the survey. The willingness to administer vaccines for COVID-19 (or other vaccines well established in the practice, like a flu vaccine) in community pharmacies is significantly different among the countries: the pharmacists from Albania were more willing to administer vaccines. The factors associated with the eagerness to vaccinate are almost the same among the countries: the lack of training in the faculty classes and the lack of a special place where to administer vaccines. Additional significant factors were found in Bulgaria (pharmacists from independent pharmacies wanted more than the pharmacists working in chain pharmacies to administer vaccines) and in Serbia (male pharmacists agreed more with administering vaccines than female pharmacists). Further national reforms are needed for adopting the expanding role of community pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
447,34901084,"Competency-Based Education: Developing an Advanced Competency Framework for Indonesian Pharmacists.  Introduction: Pharmacists need to be adaptable, flexible, and capable of advancing their practice to adapt to rapidly changing population health needs. We describe an educational approach to pharmacy workforce transformation in Indonesia through an advanced practice competency framework development using an ""adopt and adapt"" methodology. Methods: The competency framework development process comprised a translation phase, an adopt and adapt phase, validation through a nationwide mapping survey, and a completion phase through leadership consensus panels. We conducted a forward-backwards translation of a previously validated Advanced to Consultancy Level Framework (ACLF) to yield the Indonesian Advanced Development Framework (IADF) draft. The subsequent adoption and adaptation process was conducted through a series of consensus panels. We validated the IADF through a nationwide workforce survey. The final phase included leadership consensus panels with the professional leadership body in Indonesia. We analyzed the qualitative data thematically and the quantitative data using a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) technique. Results: We identified conceptual challenges in adopting and adapting the existing ACLF, which were addressed by providing a national glossary and concrete examples. A total of 6,212 pharmacists participated in the national workforce survey, of which 43% had <2 years of post-license (post-registration) experience. The MCA results showed that practitioner self-assessment to the IADF could discriminate their career development stages. The results also indicated a four-stage career model (including early years career training). Embedding this model in a structured national training program will enhance the professional workforce development through a more structured career journey. Conclusions: We describe the first validation of an advanced competency development framework for the pharmacy workforce in a non-Anglophone country, showing the possibility of transnational applicability of this framework. We argue that this methodology can be used in Low and Middle-income countries (LMICs) for the more rapid advancement of pharmaceutical care practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
448,34901410,"Qualitative Examination of Shared Decision-Making in Canada's Largest Health System: More Work to be Done : Shared Decision-Making-More Work to be Done.  Background: Shared Decision-Making (SDM) is an inclusive approach where patients and providers work in partnership to make health care decisions that are grounded in clinical best practice and align with patient preferences and values. Despite a growing recognition that SDM can lead to improved outcomes and reductions in unnecessary health investigations, tensions exist between patient agency and a historically paternalistic model of health care. As an evolving ideology, the Research Team sought to better understand the current state, challenges, and implementation opportunities of SDM practices across the health system. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional quality improvement design utilizing semistructured interviews to gather information from focus group participants. Five open-ended, qualitative questions were used to generate discussion on the perceptions of SDM and its role in clinical appropriateness in a variety of clinical contexts in our health system. A total of 12 focus groups (n = 95 participants) representative of patients and families, leaders, physicians, and frontline clinicians were engaged in the study. Results: Through a consensus-based approach, study results identified 4 recommendations based on 4 themes: Time, Communication, System Design, and Clinical Appropriateness. Conclusion: There are no easy solutions to the challenges of enabling SDM; however, success will be dependent upon recognizing the importance of patient agency, while maintaining an inclusive and continuous stakeholder engagement with both patients and providers. Implementation of the 4 recommendations at the organizational level highlighted in this study can serve as a road map for other health care institutions and will require a gradual approach to transform the general principles of SDM into tangible solutions to meet the emerging needs at both the local and system level.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
449,34901761,"Impact of a pharmacist-inclusive post-discharge clinic on outcomes in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction: Rates of hospital readmission, emergency department visits, or death. Introduction Heart failure hospitalization is a hallmark of disease progression associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Benefits of multidisciplinary clinics have been established in the care of heart failure patients and can be particularly impactful post-hospital discharge. Objective This study aimed to investigate the impact of a clinical pharmacist-integrated model of care within a Heart Failure Bridge Clinic (HFBC) at a large tertiary care referral center. Methods In this single-center retrospective study, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% discharged from Mission Hospital (Asheville, North Carolina) between August 2018 and July 2019 were screened. Patients in the HFBC arm had a clinic visit inclusive of a clinical pharmacist within 30 days of hospital discharge and were compared with a control group of patients with a usual care provider clinic visit. The HFBC provided clinical assessment, detailed heart failure education, and medication reconciliation and adjustment with an emphasis on optimization of Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT). Patients were followed for 90 days for the primary end point of hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, or death. Results A total of 1463 patients (HFBC, n = 307; control, n = 1156) comprised our final cohort. After accounting for baseline variables, 90-day cumulative probability of hospitalization, ED visit, or death favored HFBC patients (26% vs 32%, P = .0275). Comprehensive review of medications prior to and after HFBC appointment demonstrated significant alterations to therapies (30% GDMT addition, 27% GDMT titration, 7.2% discontinuation of medications associated with worsening heart failure, and 28% loop diuretic adjustment). Conclusion Clinical pharmacist-integrated HFBC allows for focused medication review and optimization and is associated with a 19% relative risk reduction in hospitalization, ED visit, or death at 90 days.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Ambulatory,
450,34903221,"Medication discrepancies among hospitalized patients with hypertension: assessment of prevalence and risk factors. BACKGROUND Medication errors remained among the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide. Furthermore, a high percentage of medication errors are classified as medication discrepancies. This study aimed to identify and quantify the different types of unintentional medication discrepancies among hospitalized hypertensive patients; it also explored the predictors of unintentional medication discrepancies among this cohort of patients. METHODS This was a prospective observational study undertaken in a large teaching hospital. A convenience sample of adult patients, taking ≥4 regular medications, with a prior history of treated hypertension admitted to a medical or surgical ward were recruited. The best possible medication histories were obtained by hospital pharmacists using at least two information sources. These histories were compared to the admission medication orders to identify any possible unintentional discrepancies. These discrepancies were classified based on their severity. Finally, the different predictors affecting unintentional discrepancies occurrence were recognized. RESULTS A high rate of unintentional medication discrepancies has been found, with approximately 46.7% of the patients had at least one unintentional discrepancy. Regression analysis showed that for every one year of increased age, the number of unintentional discrepancies per patient increased by 0.172 (P = 0.007), and for every additional medication taken prior to hospital admission, the number of discrepancies increased by 0.258 (P= 0.003). While for every additional medication at hospital admission, the number of discrepancies decreased by 0.288 (P < 0.001). Cardiovascular medications, such as diuretics and beta-blockers, were associated with the highest rates of unintentional discrepancies in our study. Medication omission was the most common type of the identified discrepancies, with approximately 46.1% of the identified discrepancies were related to omission. Regarding the clinical significance of the identified discrepancies, around two-third of them were of moderate to high significance (n= 124, 64.2%), which had the potential to cause moderate or severe worsening of the patient´s medical condition. CONCLUSIONS Unintentional medication discrepancies are highly prevalent among hypertensive patients. Medication omission was the most commonly encountered discrepancy type. Health institutions should implement appropriate and effective tools and strategies to reduce these medication discrepancies and enhance patient safety at different care transitions. Further studies are needed to assess whether such discrepancies might affect blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
451,34903246,"Information provision and retrieval by registered salespersons from consumers during over-the-counter drug sales - a questionnaire survey. BACKGROUND In Japan, non-pharmacists who are accredited as registered salespersons can sell over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and they play a very important role in supporting proper OTC drug use by consumers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate information provided to and information collected from consumers, and cooperation with pharmacists during OTC drug sales by registered salespersons, and to clarify their related concerns and behaviors. METHODS A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of 385 registered salespersons working at 56 drugstores throughout Japan was conducted. Based on the questionnaire survey, the frequency of information provision/collection in various categories was determined for the registered salespersons. The relation between concerns of registered salespersons relating to OTC drug sales and the frequency of information provision/collection was examined. The frequency of consultation of registered salespersons with a pharmacist was calculated for registered salespersons with/without in-store pharmacists. The χ-square test or Fisher's exact test was performed to assess the significance of differences. RESULTS Two hundred and seven registered salespersons (53.7%) responded completely. A greater number of OTC drug purchasers per day was associated with a greater frequency of information provision about ""side effects"" and information collection about ""favorite items"" (alcohol, tobacco, health foods, etc.) (p < 0.05). One hundred and thirty-nine (67.2%) participants had concerns about ""interactions between OTC drugs and prescription drugs"", and these concerns were related to the frequency of information provision/collection (p < 0.05). Regarding the frequency of consultation with a pharmacist, 35 of 46 participants (76.1%) working with pharmacists answered ""always"" or ""usually"", whereas only 19 of 161 participants (11.8%) working without full-time pharmacists answered ""always"" or ""usually"". More than half of the registered salespersons thought that cooperation with a pharmacist was necessary when they were ""asked about concomitant use with prescription drugs"" or ""told that side effects happened."" CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that experienced registered salespersons selling OTC drugs are more likely to collect information from consumers and to provide information to consumers. It appears to be important for registered salespersons to cooperate with pharmacists in order to provide and collect appropriate information about concomitant medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
452,34903284,"Clinical pharmacy in Israel versus the US, can we ""compare apples to apples""?-commentary.  Clinical pharmacy is an umbrella of pharmaceutical services that is practiced by clinical pharmacists. Clinical pharmacists improve the quality of drug therapy, minimize the risk for drug related problems, reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with polypharmacy and decrease the overall healthcare expenditure. Consequently, clinical pharmacy is focused on both the needs of the individual patient, as well as of the healthcare system. Clinical pharmacy is now well-established and practiced worldwide and in the last two decades has been implemented successfully in Israel. This commentary maintains that the comparison of clinical pharmacy practice in Israel and in the United States, published by AJ Rose et al., has several limitations that need to be considered when devising a road map that will fit the Israeli health care system and its environment. Emphasis should be placed on the implementation of automation and robotics, promulgating regulations to allow for integration of pharmacy technicians, and allocating funds for such services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
453,34903326,"Application of an economic evaluation approach to making regulatory decisions regarding access to medicines: advantages, challenges and recommendations.  Initially patients require a prescription to access most new medicines. Some medicines may later be reclassified, allowing patients to access them without a prescription. Currently, Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration guidelines regarding reclassification decisions focus on patient risk rather than on potential benefits to patient health and the healthcare system. We conducted two extensive case studies demonstrating an economic evaluation approach to medicine reclassification in Australia, which were presented at various conferences and to key stakeholders. This article discusses the advantages and challenges of using an economic evaluation approach to inform medicine reclassification decisions. Advantages identified include systematically and transparently synthesising evidence from multiple sources; predicting the overall expected impact of reclassification on health outcomes and costs before it occurs; considering a broader range of risks and benefits; aggregation of health impacts into a single measure (quality-adjusted life years); identification of drivers of uncertainty; insight into the effects of different regulatory decisions; and improved consistency of evidence. Challenges include data availability and quality, estimating behavioural changes, model complexity, the lack of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold, and funding of economic analyses. We recommend that regulatory decision makers use an economic evaluation approach to help inform reclassification decisions, although economic evaluation results should be considered as part of the broader body of evidence. Ultimately, the use of an economic evaluation approach will contribute to helping decision makers maximise population health outcomes in an efficient way.What is known about the topic?In the past, decisions regarding medicine reclassification have generally been made using a deliberative approach focusing on patient risk. However, there are also potential benefits to patient health and effects on the healthcare system. Increasing awareness of these benefits have led to the development of alternative approaches to decision making, including an economic evaluation approach.What does this paper add?This article discusses the advantages and challenges of using an economic evaluation approach to inform medicine reclassification decisions compared with alternative approaches.What are the implications for practitioners?Economic evaluation results should be considered as part of the broader body of evidence regarding the types of health impacts, the extent of the available evidence, who will be affected, and the role of medical practitioners and pharmacists in mitigating any risks. However, awareness of the advantages and challenges of this approach in advance will help mitigate some of the challenges and increase acceptance of the economic evaluation results by decision makers and stakeholders.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
454,34903417,"A multicenter study analyzing the association of vitamin D deficiency and replacement with infectious outcomes in patients with burn injuries.  Vitamin D (25OHD) deficiency is associated with poor outcomes in intensive care populations. The primary objective of this 7-center study was to determine if 25OHD deficiency is associated with infectious outcomes in adult burn patients. Generalized linear mixed modeling was used to control for center effect, percent total body surface area burn (% TBSA), age, and presence of inhalation injury. A total of 1147 patients were initially included (admitted January 2016 through August 2019). After exclusions, 234 (56.8%) in the deficient (25OHD < 20 ng/mL) and 178 in the non-deficient group (25OHD ≥ 20 ng/mL) remained, surpassing a priori power requirements. The non-deficient group had their concentration drawn earlier (p < 0.001), were more likely to be male (p = 0.006), Caucasian (p < 0.001), have lower body mass index (p = 0.009), lower % TBSA (p = 0.002), and taking a 25OHD supplement prior to admission (p < 0.001). Deficient patients were more likely to have an infectious outcome (52.1% vs 36.0%, p = 0.002), acute kidney injury with renal replacement therapy (p = 0.009), less ventilator free days in the first 28 days (p < 0.001), and vasopressors (p = 0.01). After controlling for center, % TBSA, age, and inhalation injury the best model also included presence of deficiency (OR 2.425 [CI 1.206-4.876]), days until 25OHD supplement initiation (OR 1.139 [CI 1.035-1.252]), and choice of cholecalciferol over ergocalciferol (OR 2.112 [CI 1.151-3.877]).

456,34903524,"Increasing oxygen prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Valid oxygen prescriptions for hospital inpatients have been a long-standing problem and have been described extensively in BMJ Open Quality with numerous quality improvement projects (QIPs) with the aim of improving compliance with oxygen prescribing.The British Thoracic Society recommends that all inpatients should have oxygen target saturation set on admission: this is motivated by risks of both undertreatment and overtreatment with oxygen. The discrepancy between the recommendation and the reality produced a number of interventions studied in QIPs over the past years, all aiming at bringing the local ward teams closer to the target. This has become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic, where non-standard oxygen saturation targets and oxygen scarcity led hospital systems to rethink their internal guidelines on the subject.We propose three novel interventions to improve compliance: a remote, personally directed email communication to a ward pharmacist, a similar communication to ward nurses, and a remote, personally directed WhatsApp communication to junior ward doctors. We undertake a QIP which compares novel interventions developed in-house with the most successful interventions from oxygen prescribing initiatives that have previously been published by BMJ Open Quality The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients with valid oxygen prescription on a ward.The series of novel interventions in three plan, do study, act cycles led to improvement in the outcome measure from 0% at baseline to 70% at the end of the QIP. The successful interventions from previous QIPs were ran in parallel on a similar ward and achieved improvement from 17.9% at baseline to 55.6% at the end of the QIP.This QIP demonstrates adapted interventions performed in context of social distancing aimed at members of multidisciplinary team which achieve superiority in increasing proportion of patients with a valid oxygen prescription, when compared with previously described methods from BMJ Open Quality.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to identify factors contributing to pharmacists' engagement in vaccination services during the first influenza vaccination campaign in 2019-2020 for the Canadian province of Quebec, led by community pharmacists. METHODS A mixed-methods study was conducted using a sequential exploratory design. Semi-structured interviews were administered to pharmacists and key informants (n = 23) and data were analysed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research in community pharmacy. The findings were then used to construct a survey of community pharmacists' engagement in vaccination, which was tested in a Quebec urban community. The study participation rate was 34.6% (n = 29). KEY FINDINGS Pharmacists expressed positive attitudes towards the implementation of vaccination services, following legislative reform. Factors such as previous involvement in vaccination campaigns and the number of pharmacists on duty were positively associated with engagement in influenza vaccination, whereas staff shortages and logistical problems were a barrier to engagement. Qualitative findings provided in-depth understanding of the value of interprofessional collaboration between pharmacists and nurses. CONCLUSIONS Vaccination in pharmacies is currently more reflective of individual choice than an indication of collective change in the profession. Logistical factors are key to enhancing the uptake of vaccination in community pharmacies throughout Quebec.

Accordingly, there is a need to improve response rates to reduce healthcare costs and patient suffering. One approach to increase rates of treatment response might be the integration of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing to stratify antidepressant drug selection. The goal of PGx assessments is to identify patients who have an increased risk to experience adverse drug reactions or non-response to specific drugs. Especially for antidepressants, there is compiling evidence on PGx influencing drug exposure as well as response. METHODS This study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted in two study centers in Switzerland: (1) the Psychiatric Clinic of Solothurn and (2) the Private Clinic Wyss in Münchenbuchsee. Adult inpatients diagnosed with a unipolar moderate or severe depressive episode are recruited at clinic admission and are included in the study. If the adjustment to a new antidepressant pharmacotherapy is necessary, the participants are randomized to either Arm A (intervention group) or Arm B (control group). If no new antidepressant pharmacotherapy is introduced the participants will be followed up in an observational arm. The intervention is the service of pharmacist-guided pre-emptive PGx testing to support clinical decision making on antidepressant selection and dosing. As a comparison, in the control group, the antidepressant pharmacotherapy is selected by the treating physician according to current treatment guidelines (standard of care) without the knowledge of PGx test results and support of clinical pharmacists. The primary outcome of this study compares the response rates under antidepressant treatment after 4 weeks between intervention and control arm. DISCUSSION The findings from this clinical trial are expected to have a direct impact on inter-professional collaborations for the handling and use of PGx data in psychiatric practice.

This study aimed to analyze the effect of fall risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) and drug-related factors relative to falls through clinical pharmacy service in hospitalized patients, focusing on the relevance of clinical pharmacist evaluation in the context of physician assessment. A prospective study of inpatient falls was conducted in 2017 retrieving data from 4 hospitals in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. An online database was developed to collect patient and fall-related data, and fall evaluation records. Healthcare professionals classified the overall effect of drugs on falls using Likert scale. Univariate and multivariate correlations were performed with a significance level of p < 0.05. Out of the total 280 falls (mean age of patients 77.0 years), a mean of 2.8 diagnoses with fall-related risk, 8.8 drugs, and 4.1 FRIDs per fall were identified. Incidence of falls decreased quarterly (p < 0.001). Use of FRIDs were positively associated with increasing age (p = 0.007). Clinical pharmacists were more likely to identify pharmacotherapy as the relevant fall-related risk, compared to physicians evaluation (p < 0.001). An increasing total number of prescribed drugs as well as higher number of FRIDs increased the suspicion in both professionals in the context of drug-related causes of falls.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
465,34907900,"Healthcare providers and professionals' experiences with telehealth oncology implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study. BACKGROUND Rapid implementation of telehealth for cancer care during COVID-19 required innovative and adaptive solutions among oncology healthcare providers and professionals' (HPPs). OBJECTIVE The objective of this qualitative study was to explore oncology HPPs' experiences with telehealth implementation during COVID-19. METHODS This study was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt), an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Prior to COVID-19, Moffitt piloted telehealth visits on a limited basis. After COVID-19, Moffitt rapidly expanded telehealth visits. Telehealth visits included real-time videoconferencing between HPPs and patients and virtual check-ins (brief communication with a HPP by telephone only). We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 oncology HPPs who implemented telehealth during COVID-19. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for themes using Dedoose software (Version 4.12). RESULTS Approximately half of participants were physicians (55%) and one quarter of participants were advanced practice providers (25%). Other participants included social workers (n=3), psychologists (n=2), dieticians (n=2), and a pharmacist. Five key themes were identified: 1) establishing and maintaining patient-HPP relationships, 2) coordinating care with other HPPs and informal caregivers, 3) adapting in-person assessments for telehealth, 4) developing workflows and allocating resources, and 5) future recommendations. Participants described innovative strategies for implementing telehealth, such as coordinating inter-disciplinary visits with multiple HPPs, and inviting informal caregivers (e.g., spouse) to participate in telehealth visits. Healthcare workers discussed key challenges, such as workflow integration, lack of physical exam and biometric data, and overcoming the digital divide (e.g., telehealth accessibility among patients with communication-related disabilities). Participants recommended policy advocacy to support telehealth (e.g., medical licensure policies) and monitoring how telehealth affects patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. CONCLUSIONS To support telehealth growth, implementation strategies are needed to ensure HPPs and patients have the tools necessary to effectively engage in telehealth. At the same time, cancer care organizations will need to engage in advocacy to ensure policies are supportive of oncology telehealth and develop systems to monitor the impact of telehealth on patient outcomes, healthcare quality, costs, and equity.

467,34909605,"Pharmacists and opioid use disorder care during COVID-19: Call for action.  Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by problematic opioid use causing significant impairment in daily life. Medication for opioid use disorder using buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone with behavioral therapy reduces illicit opioid use and risk of overdose death. Despite evidence and decades of experience, barriers limit access to treatment and care for individuals with OUD. Barriers include a lack of treatment centers particularly in rural areas, regulations on buprenorphine prescribing, and stigma from the community and health care professionals. While many barriers are longstanding, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-forced isolation and associated stress has exacerbated challenges for individuals with mental health conditions such as OUD. Pharmacists are well-positioned to bridge existing gaps in OUD care, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roles for pharmacists include OUD risk identification and screening, referral of patients to treatment and support programs, ensuring medication access, expanding naloxone access, and advocacy initiatives. This review article identifies barriers to care for patients with OUD during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores opportunities and resources for pharmacists to improve OUD care during the pandemic and beyond.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

469,34911350,"Understanding the barriers and enablers of pharmacogenomic testing in primary care: a qualitative systematic review with meta-aggregation synthesis.  Introduction: Pharmacogenomic testing can indicate which drugs may have limited therapeutic action or lead to adverse effects, hence guiding rational and safe prescribing. However, in the UK and other countries, there are still significant barriers to implementation of testing in primary care. Objective: This systematic review presents the barriers and enablers to the implementation of pharmacogenomics in primary care setting. Materials & methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched through to July 2020 for studies that reported primary qualitative data of primary care professionals and patient views. Following screening, data extraction and quality assessment, data synthesis was undertaken using meta-aggregation based on the theoretical domain's framework (TDF). Confidence in the synthesized findings relating to credibility and dependability was established using CONQual. Eligible papers were categorized into six TDF domains - knowledge; social and professional roles; behavioral regulation; beliefs and consequences; environmental context and resources; and social influences. Results: From 1669 citations, eighteen eligible studies were identified across seven countries, with a sample size of 504 participants including both primary care professionals and patients. From the data, 15 synthesized statements, all with moderate CONQual rating emerged. These categories range from knowledge, awareness among Primary Care Physicians and patients, professional relationships, negative impact of PGx, belief that PGx can reduce adverse drug reactions, clinical evidence, cost-effectiveness, informatics, reporting issues and social issues. Conclusion: Through use of TDF, fifteen synthesized statements provide policymakers with valuable recommendations for the implementation of pharmacogenomics in primary care. In preparation, policymakers need to consider the introduction of effective educational strategies for both PCPs and patients to raise knowledge, awareness, and engagement. The actual introduction of PGx will require reorganization with decision support tools to aid use of PGx in primary care, with a clear delegation of roles and responsibilities between general professionals and pharmacists supplemented by a local pool of experts. Further policy makers need to address the cost effectiveness of pharmacogenomics and having appropriate infrastructure supporting testing and interpretation including informatic solutions for utilizing pharmacogenomic results.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
470,34911656,"Health care-seeking experiences for people who inject drugs with hepatitis C: Qualitative explorations of stigma. INTRODUCTION People who inject drugs (PWID) have complex health needs and often experience poor health outcomes. For PWID, intersectional experiences of stigma and other social vulnerabilities may influence their experiences navigating medical care. We conducted a targeted subanalysis of qualitative interview data collected to inform development of a community-pharmacist care model for hepatitis C (HCV) among PWID to explore intersectional influences on health care-seeking experiences. METHODS The study recruited participants from community organizations in Seattle, Washington, and participants were eligible if they reported injection drug use within 3 months and having HCV. Study staff conducted semi-structured interviews and two independent coders transcribed and initially analyzed them using a Rapid Assessment Process, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Themes emerged regarding intersections of stigma and social vulnerabilities; thus, we conducted a targeted subanalysis guided by Fundamental Cause Theory and Earnshaw et al.'s Stigma Framework. RESULTS Forty participants (65% male; 47% non-white) reported multiple social vulnerabilities (e.g., regarding unstable housing and food insecurity). Qualitative analysis identified that receiving health care in the context of social vulnerability is challenging and burdensome (Theme 1); health care interactions are fraught with stigma stemming from intersectional vulnerabilities (Theme 2); and the belief that abstaining from drug use is needed to prove worthiness for care (Theme 3). PWID described experiencing multiple social vulnerabilities (e.g., unmet basic needs) that made seeking health care burdensome. Interactions with health care teams further reinforced participants' feelings of shame about their drug use, which influenced how participants expressed their care preferences and felt heard by providers. And as PWID navigated health care, they felt that their status as an active drug user was used to control and sometimes coerce their access to services, discouraging PWID from seeking needed care. CONCLUSIONS Stigma and social vulnerabilities play a pervasive and intersecting role in the health care-seeking experiences of PWID and negatively impact their ability to navigate and receive care they need. Evidence-based stigma reduction interventions at multiple levels, coupled with person-centered approaches to care delivery, may help to mitigate negative impacts.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective Seventy-four women have served as chief executive officer (CEO) deans of US colleges and schools of pharmacy from 1988-December 31, 2020. This article examines the characteristics of those women with the objective of providing information useful for preparing future women deans.Methods. Public domain resources were employed to obtain information about women pharmacy CEO deans including institutions where individuals served or are serving, dates of service, academic background, whether they were a founding dean, racial and ethnic diversity, and if they served or are serving in other academic higher education positions. Descriptive statistics (means, medians, standard deviations, and percentages) were used for data comparisons (quantitative research). Three early women CEO deans provide perspectives about their deanships in the Appendix (qualitative research).Results and Discussion. The median length of service is 6 years for current women deans and 8 years for women who have completed deanships. The percentage of deans holding a PhD has declined to 32.4% with a concurrent rise in deans having a PharmD (58.8%); 79.4% of current deans and 77% of all 74 deans have a professional pharmacy degree (BSPharm, PharmD or both). Women have served or are currently serving as CEO deans at a wide variety of pharmacy schools. The percentage of schools with women deans has declined in recent years to 24%.

The purpose of this study was to extend our understanding of escape room pedagogical design by investigating the impact of escape room puzzle content on changes in student immediate recall knowledge and demonstration of interprofessional skills during a subsequent interprofessional simulation.Methods. Students from nursing, pharmacy and physical therapy programs were randomized to complete an escape room themed around acute management of sepsis (intervention group; n=133) or general acute care (control group; n=129) prior to participating in a simulated patient discharge case conference. Students completed a knowledge assessment before the escape room, immediately after the escape room and immediately after the simulation. Additionally, students completed the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS-21) before and after the experience along with a post-program evaluation. Faculty rated student achievement of interprofessional learning objectives during the simulation using a standardized rubric.Results. Students in the intervention group had higher scores on the knowledge test administered immediately after the escape room. ISVS-21 scores increased from pre to post for all participants. Interprofessional learning objectives, as evaluated by faculty, were met by 248 (94.7%) students.Conclusion. An interprofessional escape room with specific puzzle content improved students' immediate recall knowledge. In both groups, self-assessed interprofessional socialization improved and faculty assessed interprofessional learning objective attainment during subsequent simulation occurred.

474,34911715,"Design and evaluation of strategies to implement HIV prevention interventions for pregnant women in community pharmacy settings in western Kenya: a mixed-methods study protocol. INTRODUCTION Community pharmacies play an important role in the healthcare system: they are frequently accessed and have increasing capacity to deliver HIV prevention services. In communities where the prevalence of HIV is high and access to antenatal care clinics is delayed or irregular, there is a unique opportunity to leverage pharmacies to enhance early and sustained access to HIV prevention among pregnant women. This study will identify women's preferences for delivery of HIV prevention services and provider-level and system-level strategies to design a new pharmacy-based model of care for pregnant women. The overall objective of this study is to design and evaluate strategies to implement HIV prevention interventions for pregnant women in community pharmacy settings in western Kenya. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We propose to conduct a discrete choice experiment to quantify preferences for delivery of HIV prevention interventions (including pre-exposure prophylaxis, partner testing and sexually transmitted infection screening and treatment) for pregnant women in community pharmacy settings. Latent class analysis will be used to quantify women's stated preferences and identify packages of intervention components that will optimise uptake among different subgroups of women. We will apply the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify provider-level and system-level factors that might influence the implementation of the optimal intervention packages. We will then use the Behaviour Change Wheel and survey a panel of experts to select and gain consensus on strategies to improve implementation. Finally, we will evaluate the potential costs of extending the implementation of HIV prevention interventions from the clinic to community pharmacy settings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The protocol was approved by the Kenyatta National Hospital-University of Nairobi Ethics Research Committee and the University of Washington Institutional Review Board. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with various stakeholders, including community members, policymakers and researchers, through local and international conferences.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

477,34912869,"Rationale and Design of a Pharmacist-led Intervention for the Risk-Based Prevention of Heart Failure: The FIT-HF Pilot Study.  Background: Given rising morbidity, mortality, and costs due to heart failure (HF), new approaches for prevention are needed. A quantitative risk-based strategy, in line with established guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention, may efficiently select patients most likely to benefit from intensification of preventive care, but a risk-based strategy has not yet been applied to HF prevention. Methods and Results: The Feasibility of the Implementation of Tools for Heart Failure Risk Prediction (FIT-HF) pilot study will enroll 100 participants free of cardiovascular disease who receive primary care at a single integrated health system and have a 10-year predicted risk of HF of ≥5% based on the previously validated Pooled Cohort equations to Prevent Heart Failure. All participants will complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire and undergo cardiac biomarker (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTn]) and echocardiography screening at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a pharmacist-led intervention or usual care for 1 year. Participants in the intervention arm will undergo consultation with a pharmacist operating under a collaborative practice agreement with a supervising cardiologist. The pharmacist will perform lifestyle counseling and recommend initiation or intensification of therapies to optimize risk factor (hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol) management according to the most recent clinical practice guidelines. The primary outcome is change in BNP at 1-year, and secondary and exploratory outcomes include changes in hs-cTn, risk factor levels, and cardiac mechanics at follow-up. Feasibility will be examined by monitoring retention rates. Conclusions: The FIT-HF pilot study will offer insight into the feasibility of a strategy of quantitative risk-based enrollment into a pharmacist-led prevention program to reduce heart failure risk.

478,34913039,"PHarmacist Avoidance or Reductions in Medical Costs in CRITically Ill Adults: PHARM-CRIT Study.  To comprehensively classify interventions performed by ICU clinical pharmacists and quantify cost avoidance generated through their accepted interventions. DESIGN A multicenter, prospective, observational study was performed between August 2018 and January 2019. SETTING Community hospitals and academic medical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS ICU clinical pharmacists. INTERVENTIONS Recommendations classified into one of 38 intervention categories (divided into six unique sections) associated with cost avoidance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Two-hundred fifteen ICU pharmacists at 85 centers performed 55,926 interventions during 3,148 shifts that were accepted on 27,681 adult patient days and generated $23,404,089 of cost avoidance. The quantity of accepted interventions and cost avoidance generated in six established sections was adverse drug event prevention (5,777 interventions; $5,822,539 CA), resource utilization (12,630 interventions; $4,491,318), individualization of patient care (29,284 interventions; $9,680,036 cost avoidance), prophylaxis (1,639 interventions; $1,414,465 cost avoidance), hands-on care (1,828 interventions; $1,339,621 cost avoidance), and administrative/supportive tasks (4,768 interventions; $656,110 cost avoidance). Mean cost avoidance was $418 per intervention, $845 per patient day, and $7,435 per ICU pharmacist shift. The annualized cost avoidance from an ICU pharmacist is $1,784,302. The potential monetary cost avoidance to pharmacist salary ratio was between $3.3:1 and $9.6:1. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacist involvement in the care of critically ill patients results in significant avoidance of healthcare costs, particularly in the areas of individualization of patient care, adverse drug event prevention, and resource utilization.

479,34913143,"Deprescribing Interventions among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations. BACKGROUND Deprescribing can reduce the use of inappropriate or unnecessary medication; however, the economic value of such interventions is uncertain. OBJECTIVE This study seeks to identify and synthetise the economic evidence of deprescribing interventions among community-dwelling older adults. METHODS Full economic evaluation studies of deprescribing interventions, conducted in the community or primary care settings, in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years were systematically reviewed. MEDLINE, EconLit, Scopus, Web of Science, CEA-TUFTS, CRD York and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to February 2021. Two researchers independently screened all retrieved articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main outcome was the economic impact of the intervention from any perspective, converted into 2019 US Dollars. The World Health Organization threshold of 1 gross domestic product per capita was used to define cost effectiveness. Studies were appraised for methodological quality using the extended Consensus on Health Economics Criteria checklist. RESULTS Of 6154 articles identified by the search strategy, 14 papers assessing 13 different interventions were included. Most deprescribing interventions included some type of medication review with or without a supportive educational component (n = 11, 85%), and in general were delivered within a pharmacist-physician care collaboration. Settings included community pharmacies, primary care/outpatient clinics and patients' homes. All economic evaluations were conducted within a time horizon varying from 2 to 12 months with outcomes in most of the studies derived from a single clinical trial. Main health outcomes were reported in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, prevented number of falls and the medication appropriateness index. Cost effectiveness ranged from dominant to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $112,932 per quality-adjusted life-year, a value above the country's World Health Organization threshold. Overall, 85% of the interventions were cost saving, dominated usual care or were cost effective considering 1 gross domestic product per capita. Nine studies scored > 80% (good) and two scored ≤ 50% (low) on critical quality appraisal. CONCLUSIONS There is a growing interest in economic evaluations of deprescribing interventions focused on community-dwelling older adults. Although results varied across setting, time horizon and intervention, most were cost effective according to the World Health Organization threshold.

480,34913180,"Hypoglycemia Associated with Direct Acting Anti-hepatitis C Virus Drugs: an Epidemiologic Surveillance Study of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Hypoglycemia induced by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction, which led to warnings by competent authorities. We therefore aimed to examine the hypoglycemic safety signal for DAAs. METHODS Reports to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2020 were analyzed. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to identify hypoglycemia cases. A case by non-case disproportionality approach was used whereby reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS In HCV infection with diabetes patients, the cumulative frequency of hypoglycemic ADRs was 21.85/1000 for reports involving DAAs vs 13.50/1000 for reports involving other medications; For DAAs as a class drug, a nearly double increased reporting odds for hypoglycemia was observed (ROR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.11-2.41). However, in DAAs subgroup analysis, only telaprevir (ROR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.01-2.74) and elbasvir/grazoprevir (ROR: 2.25, 95%CI: 1.05-4.83) were associated with increased reporting risk of hypoglycemia during corresponding marketing period; when combined with insulins and sulfonylureas, DAAs were associated with increased reporting risk for hypoglycemia (ROR: 1.98, 95%CI: 1.36-2.88; ROR: 1.62, 95%CI: 1.06-2.48), but concomitant biguanides, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the current recommendation for cautious about hypoglycemic risk relating to the use of DAAs. Treatment with DAAs and antidabetic agents (especially insulins and sulfonylureas) will increase hypoglycemia reporting risk. Physicians and pharmacists should be aware of this risk when prescribing DAAs for patients suffering from diabetes, advanced age or liver decompensation. This article is protected by copyright.

481,34913184,"Improving appropriate use of anticoagulants in hospitalised patients: a pharmacist-led Check of Medication Appropriateness intervention. AIM Inappropriate anticoagulant use increases the risk of bleeding and thrombotic events. We implemented clinical decision rules to promote judicious medication use, as part of the 'Check of Medication Appropriateness' (CMA). The CMA concerns a pharmacist-led review service, targeting potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs). In this analysis, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the CMA on anticoagulant prescribing. METHODS The number of anticoagulant-related PIPs was evaluated before and after implementation of the intervention in a quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis. The pre-implementation cohort received usual care. The anticoagulant-focused CMA, comprising 13 clinical rules pertaining to anticoagulation therapies, was implemented in the post-implementation cohort. Segmented regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the intervention on the number of residual PIPs. A residual PIP was defined as a PIP which persisted up to 48h after the CMA intervention. Total number of recommendations and acceptance rate were documented for the 2-year post-implementation period. RESULTS Pre-implementation, we observed 501 PIPs in 466 inpatients on 36 days, with a median proportion of 78.5% (range: 46.2%-100%) residual PIPs per day. Post-implementation, 538 PIPs were detected in 485 patients over the same number of days. The CMA intervention reduced the median proportion to 18.2% (range: 0-100%) per day. The effect coincided with an immediate relative reduction of 70% (95%CI 0.19-0.46) in anticoagulant-related residual PIPs. Post-implementation, 2778 recommendations were provided and 75.1% were accepted. CONCLUSION Our CMA approach significantly reduced anticoagulant-related PIPs.

482,34913359,"COVID-19 and Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation: An Analysis of US Nationwide Pharmacy Claims Data.  Background Adherence to oral anticoagulation (OAC) is critical for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have disrupted access to such therapy. We hypothesized that our analysis of a US nationally representative pharmacy claims database would identify increased incidence of lapses in OAC refills during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Results We identified individuals with atrial fibrillation prescribed OAC in 2018. We used pharmacy dispensing records to determine the incidence of 7-day OAC gaps and 15-day excess supply for each 30-day interval from January 1, 2019 to July 8, 2020. We constructed interrupted time series analyses to test changes in gaps and supply around the pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization (March 11, 2020), and whether such changes differed by medication (warfarin or direct OAC), prescription payment type, or prescriber specialty. We identified 1 301 074 individuals (47.5% women; 54% age ≥75 years). Immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, we observed a 14% decrease in 7-day OAC gaps and 56% increase in 15-day excess supply (both P<0.001). The increase in 15-day excess supply was more marked for direct OAC (69% increase) than warfarin users (35%; P<0.001); Medicare beneficiaries (62%) than those with commercial insurance (43%; P<0.001); and those prescribed OAC by a cardiologist (64%) rather than a primary care provider (48%; P<0.001). Conclusions Our analysis of nationwide claims data demonstrated increased OAC possession after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings may have been driven by waivers of early refill limits and patients' tendency to stockpile medications in the first weeks of the pandemic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to develop a mobile app to facilitate self-management of nondialysis-dependent CKD. METHODS Our stakeholder team included 4 patients with stage 3-4 nondialysis-dependent CKD; a kidney transplant recipient; a caretaker; CKD care providers (pharmacists, a nurse, primary care physicians, a nephrologist, and a cardiologist); 2 health services and CKD researchers; a researcher in biomedical informatics, nutrition, and obesity; a system developer; and 2 programmers. Focus groups and in-person interviews with the patients and providers were conducted using a focus group and interview guide based on existing literature on CKD self-management and the mobile app quality criteria from the Mobile App Rating Scale. Qualitative analytic methods including the constant comparative method were used to analyze the focus group and interview data. RESULTS Patients and providers identified and discussed a list of requirements and preferences regarding the content, features, and technical aspects of the mobile app, which are unique for CKD self-management. Requirements and preferences centered along themes of communication between patients and caregivers, partnership in care, self-care activities, adherence to treatment regimens, and self-care self-efficacy. These identified themes informed the features and content of our mobile app. The mobile app user can enter health data including blood pressure, weight, and blood glucose levels. Symptoms and their severity can also be entered, and users are prompted to contact a physician as indicated by the symptom and its severity. Next, mobile app users can select biweekly goals from a set of predetermined goals with the option to enter customized goals. The user can also keep a list of medications and track medication use. Our app includes feedback mechanisms where in-range values for health data are depicted in green and out-of-range values are depicted in red. We ensured that data entered by patients could be downloaded into a user-friendly report, which could be emailed or uploaded to an electronic health record. The mobile app also includes a mechanism that allows either group or individualized video chat meetings with a provider to facilitate either group support, education, or even virtual clinic visits. The CKD app also includes educational material on CKD and its symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with CKD and CKD care providers believe that a mobile app can enhance CKD self-management by facilitating patient-provider communication and enabling self-care activities including treatment adherence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
484,34915405,"Integrating neurology and pharmacy through telemedicine: A novel care model.  Teleneurology had been best studied in acute stroke care, but the Coronavirus (COVID)-19 pandemic has highlighted applicability in outpatient practice. Telepharmacy is a convenient method for pharmacists to provide medication management to enhance care. Studies in the outpatient space suggest non-inferiority of teleneurology to increase access to specialized care for patients in rural locations. The role of telemedicine based interdisciplinary collaborations in a metropolitan and under-resourced setting has not been explored.

485,34915596,"Social distance towards schizophrenia in health professionals. OBJECTIVE The stigma and prejudice of the public regarding psychiatric disorders are a long-standing social problem. However, health professionals are more likely to have negative attitudes and label people with mental health conditions. This study aimed to investigate how self-rated familiarity and literacy about schizophrenia are related to social distancing towards schizophrenia patients among health professionals in Taiwan. METHOD This study used a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and invited respondents to complete the survey either electronically or in a pencil/paper format. Respondents included health professionals in different disciplines and students under medical placements. The survey instrument consists of three parts: sociodemographic information, the 18-item Social Distance Scale for schizophrenia, and the 19-item Schizophrenia Experience and Knowledge Questionnaires. Data were analyzed using linear regression models to explore sociodemographic factors, self-rated familiarity, and literacy total scores about social distance, attitude, and opinions towards schizophrenia. RESULT In total, 420 health professionals completed the questionnaire, of which 24.5% were physicians, 36.0% nurses, 6.7% pharmacists, and 28.6% interns. The majority of respondents (n = 360, 85.7%) had contact experience with schizophrenia patients, and approximately 60% rated their experience as a positive impression. Although 62.9% of respondents had received psychiatric education or training, 86% believed that such education/training was insufficient. Moreover, over half of the respondents did not have confidence in their knowledge of schizophrenia. Older age, being married, and having more working experience were associated with high social distance, a negative attitude, and high prejudice. More familiarity with schizophrenia was associated with low social distance, a positive attitude, and less prejudice. A high literacy score was associated with a positive attitude and less prejudice, but no significant correlation was observed with social distance (β ± SE = -0.26 ± 0.14, p = .057). Among respondents who rated their past contact experiences as negative, neither familiarity nor literacy was associated with social distance. CONCLUSION High levels of self-rated familiarity and high literacy about schizophrenia were associated with low social distance, a positive attitude, and less prejudice towards schizophrenia among health professionals. Therefore, sufficient education and training are imperative to increase familiarity and knowledge of schizophrenia. Appropriate education could be implemented from different perspectives, including communication skills, resources of social support, and topics to reduce stigma and prejudice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

487,34915784,"Perception of roles across the interprofessional team for delivery of medical assistance in dying.  In 2016, Canada joined many jurisdictions worldwide in legalizing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD). Given the paucity of qualitative research regarding the involvement of interprofessional health care providers (HCPs) in MAiD, the goal of this study was to better understand how HCPs viewed their role(s). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 3 pharmacists, 10 nurses, and 8 social workers at an academic hospital in Toronto. Thematic analysis generated six broad themes: 1) Practical/Technical Component, 2) Education, 3) Support, 4) ""Part of the Job,"" 5) ""All of the Job,"" and 6) Lack of Published Information. While nurses and social workers espoused many commonalities, nursing roles were more ""in the moment,"" whereas social workers viewed their roles as beginning earlier and extending after provision of MAiD. There was a spectrum of how participants perceived their role: pharmacists minimized the task of dispensing medications as an insignificant experience, nurses viewed involvement as consistent with their other professional duties (specifically non-MAiD deaths), and social workers described MAiD as a unique opportunity to employ the full gamut of their skills. The study highlights the importance of supporting HCPs through education and information at both regulatory and research levels, recognizing the key roles they play in MAiD.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
488,34916170,"HIV PrEP access and affordability: a multidisciplinary specialty pharmacy model. BACKGROUND Increasing the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) providers expands PrEP access to more eligible patients to help end the HIV epidemic. Previous studies have noted providers perceive financial barriers as a limitation to prescribing PrEP. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe PrEP medication access and affordability in patients seen at a multidisciplinary PrEP clinic. METHOD We conducted a single-center, retrospective, cohort study of adults initiating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine in the Vanderbilt PrEP Clinic between September 1, 2016, and March 31, 2019, with prescriptions filled by Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy. Data were gathered from the electronic health records and pharmacy claims. We evaluated 3 different time periods: initial evaluation to PrEP initiation, prescription of PrEP to insurance approval, and insurance approval to initiation. Treatment initiation was considered delayed when > 7 days from initial evaluation, and reasons for delay were recorded. Continuous variables are presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]), and categorical variables are presented as percentages. RESULTS We included 63 patients; most were male (97%), white (84%), and commercially insured (94%) with a median age of 38 years (IQR 29-47). Primary indication for PrEP was men who have sex with men at high risk of acquiring HIV (97%). Median time from initial appointment to treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4-8). Treatment delays occurred in 25% of patients and were mostly driven by patient preference (50%). Insurance prior authorization was required in 27% of patients; all were approved. Median total out-of-pocket medication costs for the entire study period were $0 (IQR $0-$0). Most patients (86%) used manufacturer copay cards. CONCLUSION In this cohort of mostly commercially insured men, the majority were able to access PrEP with low out-of-pocket costs facilitated by manufacturer assistance. Although generalizability beyond this population is limited, these results contradict perceived financial barriers to PrEP access.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Simulation and gamification are two popular educational tools utilized to enhance student learning and engagement. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating a hybrid cancer clinic simulation into the curricula for third-year pharmacy (P3) students. METHODS This prospective, single-arm pilot study incorporated a mixed-method learning activity involving patient simulation and escape room elements. Two cancer clinic simulations were developed by faculty members. For each clinic, students were randomly divided into 6 groups and tasked with completing a series of Pharmacist Patient Care Process (PPCP) activities involving patient actors. The PPCP activities were interwoven with engaging puzzles and games to simulate an escape room. Student learning and retention was measured by pre- and post-simulation quizzes and course level exams. A perceptions survey was administered after each simulation activity. RESULTS Thirty-six students participated in both cancer clinic simulations, with 100% completing all aspects of the study. Mean student quiz scores improved from 61.4% to 81.7% (p < 0.0001) and 52.6% to 81.8% (p < 0.0001) following the first and second simulations, respectively. Exam performance improved for 16 out of 19 exam questions, with a significant increase in 4 questions (p < 0.05). Students overwhelmingly agreed that the cancer clinic simulations 1) reinforced knowledge, 2) facilitated PPCP, 3) improved their ability to make chemotherapeutic recommendations, 4) enhanced problem-solving skills, and 5) encouraged collaboration. CONCLUSION This innovative hybrid simulation enhanced oncology-related knowledge and supported an interactive environment that improved student confidence and teamwork.

491,34919337,"Standardization of topical preparations for finger-tip unit-Awareness and attitudes among pharmacists and dermatologists and suggestions to improve standardization of topical drug dosing-A two-phase cross-sectional survey. BACKGROUND Standardization of topical therapy dosage is important to ensure optimum use and dosage of topical medications. One of the concepts frequently used in the standardization of topical treatment is the Finger-tip unit (FTU). While practitioners, both dermatologists and pharmacists, are generally aware of FTU, practical use is less. OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate views and practices related to FTU among both dermatology and pharmacy faculty and to elicit and validate suggestions for improving standardization. METHODS We surveyed a group of Dermatologists and Pharmacists-in two phases-in phase 1 (n = 44), an electronic survey was used as a tool to understand their practices regarding FTU, and to obtain suggestions regarding standardization of topical medication delivery. In phase 2 (n = 40), the main suggestions for improvement were resent to the group to rate and validate the same. RESULTS The awareness of FTU was high among the experts, but practical use of the FTU for patient counselling was less frequent. The group gave suggestions to standardize applications. All these suggestions got high ratings on both feasibility and possible effectiveness in the second phase, with the highest rating being for the suggestion of ""Placing QR codes on ointment/cream tubes which link to websites with educational materials/ videos on FTU/topical drug dosing."" CONCLUSION Awareness regarding FTU is high among both dermatologists and pharmacists, however practical use is less.

OBJECTIVE To describe the steps, hurdles, and recommendations for implementation of the immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) evidence-based protocol at a high-volume Canadian tertiary care centre. DESIGN Quality-improvement study. PARTICIPANTS A total of 406 patients who underwent ISBCS from July 2020 to December 2020. Patients were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria including psychosocial factors, refractive error and consent. This initiative impacted staff at all levels involved with cataract surgery. METHODS The Model of Improvement framework was used and involved numerous discussions with multidisciplinary teams of ophthalmologists, nursing and support staff, management, pharmacists, and medical device reprocessing teams. This initiative was created and refined via a thorough review of the literature and current best practices. It was implemented in July 2020 after a nursing ""huddle."" Any adverse outcomes and overall impact were collected from various levels of staff involved. RESULTS Each eye was treated as a separate surgery with a double time-out per bilateral case. Additional measures were taken to ensure different lot numbers for medications, equipment, and materials. This practice increased surgical volume by approximately 25% and reduced the number of patient visits by 50%, reducing potential COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSIONS The resulting protocol from our study may be useful to other centres wishing to integrate ISBCS as one example of successful implementation.

OBJECTIVE Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) significantly reduces inappropriate antibiotic use and improves patient outcomes. In low-resource settings, AMS implementation may require concurrent strengthening of clinical microbiology capacity therefore additional investments. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of implementing AMS at Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital (TASH), a tertiary care hospital in Ethiopia. DESIGN We developed a Markov cohort model to assess the cost-utility of pharmacist-led AMS with concurrent strengthening of laboratory capacity compared with usual care from a 'restricted societal' perspective. We used a lifetime time horizon and discounted health outcomes and cost at 3% annually. Data were extracted from a prospective study of bloodstream infections among patients hospitalised at TASH, supplemented by published literature. We assessed parameter uncertainty using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. SETTING Tertiary care hospital in Ethiopia, with 800 beds and serves over half a million patients per year. POPULATION Cohort of adults and children inpatient population aged 19.8 years at baseline. INTERVENTION Laboratory-supported pharmacist-led AMS compared with usual care. Usual care is defined as empirical initiation of antibiotic therapy in the absence of strong laboratory and AMS. OUTCOME MEASURES Expected life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (US$2018) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS Laboratory-supported AMS strategy dominated usual care, that is, AMS was associated with an expected incremental gain of 38.8 QALYs at lower expected cost (incremental cost savings:US$82 370) per 1000 patients compared with usual care. Findings were sensitive to medication cost, infection-associated mortality and AMS-associated mortality reduction. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that AMS programme was likely to be cost-effective at 100% of the simulation compared with usual care at 1%-51% of gross domestic product/capita. CONCLUSION Our study indicates that laboratory-supported pharmacist-led AMS can result in improved health outcomes and substantial healthcare cost savings, demonstrating its economic advantage in a tertiary care hospital despite greater upfront investments in a low-resource setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
495,34921081,"""Vaccination needs to be easy for the people, right ?"": a qualitative study of the roles of physicians and pharmacists regarding vaccination in Switzerland. OBJECTIVE Vaccination in pharmacies has been a key component of national vaccination strategies to facilitate vaccination access. Qualitative data on the perspectives of professional stakeholders on vaccination in pharmacies and on the professional relations of pharmacists with physicians regarding increasing immunisation rates is limited. We conducted a qualitative study in Switzerland. The main aim was to gain further insight into professional stakeholders' perspectives on vaccination counselling and administration conducted in pharmacies, and to further understand their views on physicians' and pharmacists' roles in increasing immunisation rates. DESIGN We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews. We coded and analysed transcripts using thematic analysis. SETTING Face-to-face interviews took place in German-speaking and French-speaking regions of Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS We interviewed 14 key vaccination stakeholders including health authorities, heads of pharmacy management and professional association boards. All participants had a background in medicine or pharmacy. RESULTS Three main themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) Participants viewed pharmacists as competent to provide vaccination counselling and administration based on their university training; (2) interprofessional cooperation between physicians and pharmacists on vaccination topics is limited and should be improved; and (3) pharmacists play an important role in increasing immunisation rates by facilitating vaccination access and through provision of vaccination counselling.

The study aims to describe routine clinical practice and the views of physicians and pharmacists on prediabetes management. MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 410 physicians and 393 pharmacists completed the questionnaire. Self-adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) was reported by 51.5% and 23.2% of physicians and pharmacists, respectively. Less than 60% of participants defined prediabetes according to main CPG. Regarding the use of screening strategies to detect prediabetes (physicians: 96%; pharmacists: 42.1%), reports indicate the opportunistic strategy is widely employed (≥75%) whereas systematic screening is unusual (<20%). Changes in lifestyle were deemed essential by almost all participants (≥95%), but in clinical practice only 58.3% of healthcare centers and 28.0% of pharmacies were found to provide awareness-raising/instruction. The role of pharmacists in the prevention of prediabetes/diabetes was judged useful by most participants. CONCLUSIONS Use of CPG, systematic prediabetes screening strategies, and specific strategies for patient education are scarce. The support of community pharmacists in prediabetes management was well valued.

499,34924311,"Comparison of pharmacists' scoring of fall risk to other fall risk assessments. OBJECTIVES Given their professional education and participation within the health care system, pharmacists are ideal candidates to assess drug-associated fall risk for patients. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether pharmacists can quantitatively differentiate individuals who reported falling within the previous year (fallers) from those who do not (nonfallers), and to compare the pharmacists' evaluation with 2 recently published fall risk assessments. DESIGN Cross-sectional design of pharmacists' assessments of fall risk. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This is a cross-sectional study where 6 licensed pharmacists evaluated patient records from Wave 1 of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project dataset using generic drug list (drug counts), age, and body mass index to generate a Pharmacist Risk Score (PRS) based on these variables. Pharmacists were allowed to use drug information resources and were provided with a simple 5-point scale to assist them in scoring patients. OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measure of this study was a comparison of the following fall risk assessments (PRS, drug counts, Medication-Based Index of Physical Function, Quantitative Drug Index, and Timed Up and Go [TUG]) capacity to differentiate fallers from nonfallers. RESULTS Each fall risk assessment was highly correlated (P < 0.001) with the number of reported falls. Drug-associated fall risk assessments were highly correlated (P < 0.001) with each other, but not with TUG. Each fall risk assessment differentiated fallers from nonfallers based on logistic regression (P ≤ 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was significant (P ≤ 0.002) for each assessment. The comparison of ROC area under the curve for the fall risk assessments found no significant difference between the PRS and other assessments.

BACKGROUND Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Dependence (MATOD) is clinically effective and cost effective, yet a lack of MATOD prescribers in the community limits access to this treatment in Australia. These shortages are often greatest in regional and rural areas. OBJECTIVE(S) The Enhancing Pharmacist Involvement in Care (EPIC)-MATOD study will evaluate clinical and implementation outcomes among people with opioid dependence receiving MATOD through a collaborative pharmacist-prescriber model of care across multiple sites in a regional location (encompassing a mix of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas) of Victoria, Australia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The EPIC-MATOD study is a prospective, multisite, implementation trial of collaborative MATOD care. Pharmacists and prescribers will be recruited through the local network of opioid pharmacotherapy providers. Patients will be recruited through participating healthcare providers. After induction into the collaborative care model, patients and healthcare professionals will be followed up over 6- (patients) and 12-months (pharmacists and prescribers) in a hybrid implementation-efficacy study, with outcomes mapped to the RE-AIM framework. The primary clinical efficacy endpoint is patient retention in treatment at 26 weeks. The primary implementation outcome is treatment capacity, based on prescriber time required to provide treatment through collaborative care compared with traditional care. Secondary clinical endpoints include attendance for dosing and clinical reviews, substance use, mental and physical health and overall well-being. Implementation costs, acceptability, and provider engagement in collaborative care will be used as secondary implementation outcome indicators. Time and costs associated with collaborative care, and health service utilisation, will also be estimated.

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has put community pharmacists at the frontline of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. Pharmacies had to reorganize and implement several different interventions and measures within a very short time frame. OBJECTIVES 1) To map the current reported practice and trends and to review the literature on pharmacy-based interventions on COVID-19 provided in Europe; 2) To identify knowledge gaps and future avenues for pharmacy research, policy, and practice in response to public health emergencies. METHODS We used a mixed methods approach combining country mapping of current practices of pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 reported by pharmacy associations in Europe with a scoping review of published literature. RESULTS We mapped current practices on 31 pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 in 32 countries in Europe. Almost all preventive measures to reduce health risks have been provided in most countries. Other frequent interventions reflected preparedness for stockpiling, increased demand for services and products, and important patient care interventions exceeding dispensing role. Expanded powers granted to pharmacies and legislation passed in view of COVID-19 enabled services that improve access to medicines and relevant products, patient screening and referral including point-of-care antigen testing, support to vulnerable patients, and COVID-19 vaccination. We identified 9 studies conducted in pharmacies in 7 countries in Europe. Most studies are cross-sectional and/or descriptive. Pharmacy associations played an important supporting role by developing and updating guidance and emergency plans to assist community pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS A wide array of pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 was implemented in several countries within a very short time frame.

The National Department of Health published their Quality Standards for Healthcare Establishments in South Africa and introduced the National Health Insurance, with the pilot phase that commenced in 2012. The system requires an adequate supply of pharmaceutical personnel and the direct involvement of clinical pharmacists throughout the medication-use process to ensure continuity of care, minimised risk with increasing improvement of patient outcomes. The study aimed to provide insight into the pressing issues of clinical pharmacy practice in South Africa, and sets out to contextualise the current profile of the pharmacist performing clinical functions. The study used a quantitative, explorative, cross-sectional design. The population included pharmacists from private and public tertiary hospitals. A questionnaire was administered, using Typeform™. Ethics approval was obtained from Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, National Department of Health and Private Healthcare groups. Categorical data were summarised using frequency counts and percentages; continuous data were summarised by mean values and standard deviations. The sample size included 70 pharmacists practicing clinical pharmacy (private sector n = 59; public sector n = 11). Most participants hold a BPharm degree (busy with MPharm qualification) (64%; n = 70). No statistical significance was found between participants in private and public practice. Most pharmacist agreed (32% (private); n = 59) and strongly agreed (45% (public); n = 11) to have sufficient training to perform pharmaceutical care. The majority respondents felt that interventions made by the pharmacist improved the rational use of medicine (47% (private); 55% (public). Pharmacist interventions influence prescribing patterns (42% (private); 64% (public); and reduce polypharmacy (41% (private); 55% (public).

Background: Discharge from acute mental health inpatient units is often a vulnerable period for patients. Multiple professionals and agencies are involved and processes and procedures are not standardized, often resulting in communication delays and co-ordination failures. Early and appropriate discharge planning and standardization of procedures could make inpatient care safer. Aim: To inform the development of a multi-component best practice guidance for discharge planning (including the 6 component SAFER patient flow bundle) to support safer patient transition from mental health hospitals to the community. Methods: Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness method, a panel of 10 professional stakeholders (psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, pharmacists, academics, and policy makers) rated evidence-based statements. Six hundred and sixty-eight statements corresponding to 10 potential components of discharge planning best practice were rated on a 9-point integer scale for clarity, appropriateness and feasibility (median ≥ 7-9) using an online questionnaire then remote online face-to-face meetings. Results: Five of the six ""SAFER"" patient flow bundle components were appropriate and feasible for inpatient mental health. One component, ""Early Flow,"" was rated inappropriate as mental health settings require more flexibility. Overall, 285 statements were rated as appropriate and feasible. Forty-four statements were considered appropriate but not feasible to implement. Discussion: This consensus study has identified components of a best practice guidance/intervention for discharge planning for UK mental health settings. Although some components describe processes that already happen in everyday clinical interactions (i.e., review by a senior clinician), standardizing such processes could have important safety benefits alongside a tailored and timely approach to post-discharge care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth of flowers is not only for their ornamental value, but also for nutritional, medicinal, cooking, cosmetic and aromatic properties. They are a rich source of many compounds, which play an important role in various metabolic processes of the human body [3]. Edible flowers can promote the global demand for more attractive and delicious food, and can improve the nutritional content of gourmet food [4]. Flowers are beneficial for anti-anxiety, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, diuretic and immune-modulator, etc. It is very important to identify edible flowers correctly, because only a few are edible [5]. The shapes or colors of different flowers may be very similar. Visual evaluation is one of the classification methods, but it is error-prone and time-consuming [6]. Flowers are divided into flowers from herbaceous plants (flower) and flower trees (blossom). Now there is a public herbaceous flower dataset [7], but lack of dataset for Chinese medicinal blossoms. This article presents and establishes the dataset for twelve most commonly and economically valuable blossoms used in traditional Chinese medicine. The dataset provide a collection of blossom images on traditional Chinese herbs help Chinese pharmacist to classify the categories of Chinese herbs. In addition, the dataset can serve as a resource for researchers who use different algorithms of machine learning or deep learning for image segmentation and image classification.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
506,34926995,"Health Care Providers' Trusted Sources for Information About COVID-19 Vaccines: Mixed Methods Study. Background Information and opinions shared by health care providers can affect patient vaccination decisions, but little is known about who health care providers themselves trust for information in the context of new COVID-19 vaccines. Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate which sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines are trusted by health care providers and how they communicate this information to patients. Methods This mixed methods study involved a one-time, web-based survey of health care providers and qualitative interviews with a subset of survey respondents. Health care providers (physicians, advanced practice providers, pharmacists, nurses) were recruited from an integrated health system in Southern California using voluntary response sampling, with follow-up interviews with providers who either accepted or declined a COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome was the type of information sources that respondents reported trusting for information about COVID-19 vaccines. Bivariate tests were used to compare trusted information sources by provider type; thematic analysis was used to explore perspectives about vaccine information and communicating with patients about vaccines. Results The survey was completed by 2948 providers, of whom 91% (n=2683) responded that they had received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The most frequently trusted source of COVID-19 vaccine information was government agencies (n=2513, 84.2%); the least frequently trusted source was social media (n=691, 9.5%). More physicians trusted government agencies (n=1226, 93%) than nurses (n=927, 78%) or pharmacists (n=203, 78%; P<.001), and more physicians trusted their employer (n=1115, 84%) than advanced practice providers (n=95, 67%) and nurses (n=759, 64%; P=.002). Qualitative themes (n=32 participants) about trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information were identified: processing new COVID-19 information in a health care work context likened to a ""war zone"" during the pandemic and communicating information to patients. Some providers were hesitant to recommend vaccines to pregnant people and groups they perceived to be at low risk for COVID-19. Conclusions Physicians have stronger trust in government sources and their employers for information about COVID-19 vaccines compared with nurses, pharmacists, and advanced practice providers. Strategies such as role modeling, tailored messaging, or talking points with standard language may help providers to communicate accurate COVID-19 vaccine information to patients, and these strategies may also be used with providers with lower levels of trust in reputable information sources.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
507,34927150,"How Do We Taper and Discontinue Opioids in Cancer Patients? Considerations from the Activities of a Palliative Care Team at a University Hospital.  Background: The more the cancer treatments progress, the more the needs increase to taper and discontinue opioids in cancer patients. Furthermore, opioid dependence of cancer survivors has become a bigger problem. However, a safe opioid tapering and discontinuation method has not yet been established in cancer patients. Objective: To suggest a safe opioid tapering and discontinuation method in cancer patients. Design: We reviewed opioid type, dose, administration route, administration duration, reason for tapering and discontinuation, and presence/absence of opioid withdrawal symptoms in cancer patients whose opioids needed to be tapered and discontinued. Setting/Subjects: We recruited cancer patients referred to the palliative care team of Kyoto University Hospital-Japan whose opioids were tapered and discontinued. Measurements: Opioid withdrawal symptoms were assessed by two physicians, one nurse, and one pharmacist of palliative care team. Results: Opioids were tapered and discontinued in 25 out of 145 cancer patients (17%). Opioid withdrawal symptoms were observed in 3 of the 25 cases (12%). In withdrawal symptom cases and nonwithdrawal symptom cases, the mean maximum oral morphine-equivalent doses of opioids were 352.0 and 55.7 mg/day, and the mean administration duration of opioid were 82.3 and 28.7 days, respectively. Withdrawal symptoms occurred in patients receiving higher-dose opioids with longer administration duration and their symptoms tended to appear at approximately 10% of the maximum dose. Conclusions: We suggest that withdrawal symptoms may be prevented by using a two-stage method rather than a monotonous tapering method in cancer patients whose higher-dose opioid with longer administration duration needed to be tapered and discontinued.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
508,34927479,"Onco-pharmacist led evaluation of knowledge, attitude & practice (KAP) of safe handling cytotoxic drugs among health care professional's (HCP's) in tertiary care hospital: A hospital based interventional Study. BACKGROUND Cytotoxic drugs (CDs) are hazardous in nature. But it is necessary for the treatment in cancer patients. The healthcare professionals (HCPs) act as a facilitator through which the manufactured CDs reach the patient. However, safe handling of CDs becomes a primary concern not only for the recipients but also for the HCPs. METHODS On Ethics committee approval, a prospective- interventional study was conducted among HCPs who are involved in handling of CDs in Oncology department of tertiary care hospital. The participants were screened for their eligibility criteria & 73 HCPs were recruited. The initial data was collected from the HCPs through interview & questionnaires. Later the participants were trained by oncology-pharmacist (7-8 months) for safe handling of CDs. After the training the participants were tested again through interview & questionnaires. RESULTS 73 participants, (75%) nurses & (25%) physicians were included in the study. Among these participants, only 32.87% underwent training on reconstitution whereas 67.12% of the participants didn't undergo any training. The increase in mean score of KAP after the training was observed to be 3.44 ± 4.32, 1.23 ± 1.51 and 1.3 ± 1.01 respectively. CONCLUSION The study concludes that mandatory requirement of training for HCPs using SOP's by qualified oncology-pharmacist to minimize the hazardous effects of CDs. It also highlights the improvisation techniques for handling of CDs will enhance the safety profile of HCPs & the patients, which helps in refining the quality of pharmaceutical and health care services provided in the cancer care settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
509,34927577,"Methodological considerations in establishing and maintaining longitudinal health workforce studies: Lessons learned from the WiSDOM cohort in South Africa. BACKGROUND Health workforce cohort studies are uncommon in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE Describe the methodology and lessons learned from establishing and maintaining the WiSDOM (Wits longitudinal Study to Determine the Operation of the labour Market among its health professional graduates) health professional cohort study in South Africa. METHODS WiSDOM is a prospective longitudinal cohort study that commenced in 2017. The cohort focuses on the eight professional groups of clinical associates, dentists, doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, oral hygienists, pharmacists and physiotherapists. Annual, electronic follow-up surveys have been conducted in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with informed consent. Key steps in establishing the WiSDOM cohort include consultation, communication and marketing, stakeholder feedback, resources and infrastructure. Retention strategies consist of an electronic database, detailed cohort contact information, cohort engagement, communication and feedback, short survey tools, and appropriate incentives. RESULTS We obtained an overall response rate of 89.5% at baseline in 2017, 79.6% in 2018, 68.3% in 2019 and 72.8% in 2020. The largest decline in response rates is for medical doctors: 66.0% response rate in 2018, 53.2% in 2019 and 58.2% in 2020. However, for each of the three follow-up surveys, we have obtained response rates in excess of 80% for clinical associates, dentists, nurses, oral hygienists, pharmacists and physiotherapists. Since baseline, the outright refusals have remained very low at 4.7%. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that self-identified race was the only significant socio-demographic difference between medical doctor respondents and non-respondents. Black African doctors and Indian doctors were 2.0 and 2.6 times more likely respectively to respond than White doctors (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Other LMICs can learn from WiSDOM's lessons of establishing and maintaining a health professional cohort that aims to generate new knowledge for health system transformation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
510,34928443,"Urine tricarboxylic acid cycle signatures of early-stage diabetic kidney disease. INTRODUCTION Urine tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle organic anions (OAs) are elevated in diabetes and may be biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. OBJECTIVES We assessed associations of 10 urine TCA cycle OAs with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and eGFR slope. METHODS This study is ancillary to the Simultaneous Risk Factor Control Using Telehealth to SlOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease (STOP-DKD) Trial-a randomized trial of pharmacist-led medication and behavior management in 281 patients with early to moderate DKD at Duke from 2014 to 2015. We used linear mixed models to assess associations of urine TCA cycle OAs with outcomes and modelled TCA cycle OAs as: (1) the average of z-scores for each OA; and (2) principal component (PC) scores derived by principal component analysis (PCA). Untargeted urine metabolomics were added for additional discovery. RESULTS Among 132 participants with 24 h urine samples (50% men; 58% Black; mean age 64 years [SD 9]; mean eGFR 74 ml/min/1.73m2 [SD 21] and median urine albumin-to-creatinine [UACR] 20 mg/g [IQR 8-95]), PCA identified 3 OA metabolite PCs. Malate, fumarate, pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, lactate, succinate and citrate/isocitrate loaded positively on PC1; methylsuccinate, ethylmalonate and succinate loaded positively on PC2; and methylmalonate, ethylmalonate and citrate/isocitrate loaded negatively on PC3. Over a median follow-up of 1.8 years (IQR, 1.2 to 2.2), higher average OA z-score was strongly associated with higher eGFR after covariate adjustment (p = 0.01), but not with eGFR slope (p = 0.9). Higher PC3, but not other PCs, was associated with lower eGFR (p < 0.001). Conditional random forests and smooth clipped absolute deviation models confirmed methylmalonate, citrate/isocitrate, and ethylmalonate, and added lactate as top ranked metabolites in models of baseline eGFR (R-squared 0.32 and 0.33, respectively). Untargeted urine metabolites confirmed association of urine TCA cycle OAs with kidney function. CONCLUSION Thus, lower urine TCA cycle OAs, most notably lower methylmalonate, ethylmalonate and citrate/isocitrate, are potential indicators of kidney impairment in early stage DKD.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
511,34930487,"Role of clinical pharmacists in epilepsy management at a general hospital in Vietnam: a before-and-after study. BACKGROUND Clinical pharmacists have an important role in inter-professional healthcare collaboration for epilepsy management. However, the pharmacy practices of managing epilepsy are still limited in Vietnam, deterring pharmacists from routine adjustments of antiepileptic drugs, which could decrease the patients' quality of life. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of pharmacist interventions in epilepsy treatment at a Vietnamese general hospital. METHODS A before-and-after study was conducted from January 2016 to December 2018. All patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy and being treated at the investigated hospital were recruited and screened for eligibility and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in good control of their epilepsy (with two seizures or less in a year). The secondary outcome was the number of patients maintaining optimized concentrations within the therapeutic range of carbamazepine (4-12 mg/L), phenytoin (10-20 mg/L), or valproic acid (50-100 mg/L). Collected data were analyzed using two proportions Z-test or Chi-square test. RESULTS A total of 141 participants were enrolled in the study. While most patients were given lower prescribed daily doses than the recommendations from the World Health Organization, over 56% of the participants still experienced adverse drug effects. More than half of the patients received at least one pharmacists' intervention, which increased by 25.0% the effectiveness of the therapy (p < 0.001) and by 14.6% the number of patients with optimized drug concentrations (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION Epilepsy management requires a multiple-stepped and comprehensive approach, with a focus on the health and safety of the patients. As part of the healthcare team, pharmacists need to engage at every stage to monitor the patient's response and determine the most effective treatment with the fewest adverse drug reactions.

512,34930680,"Coronavirus 2019 work-from-home productivity of inpatient and infusion pharmacists at a comprehensive cancer center. PURPOSE To evaluate inpatient and infusion pharmacist order verification productivity when working from home and to report their perceptions of a flexible workplace setting. METHODS Order verification data were pulled from the electronic medical record from April 27, 2020, to June 30, 2020, matched to the pharmacist schedule on the basis of work setting and reported as average orders verified per day. Pharmacist perceptions were gathered via a survey to evaluate practice setting background, workplace setting preference, and perceived changes in workflow and their productivity. RESULTS There was an overall increase in order verification productivity when working from home. Inpatient pharmacists, on average, verified 152 orders per day from home and 133 orders per day onsite. Infusion pharmacists, on average, verified 144 orders per day working from home and 117 orders per day working onsite. Fifty-nine percent of pharmacists reported preferring the mix of onsite and home workplace setting and noted little change in workflow. In addition, 57% of the pharmacists perceived themselves as being more productive, 32% as maintaining the same level of productivity, and 10% felt that they are less productive when working from home. The order verification data showed a greater increase in productivity for infusion shifts worked from home than inpatient shifts. CONCLUSION The coronavirus 2019 pandemic prompted pharmacy departments to re-evaluate their ability to provide an option for a flexible workplace for pharmacists. Our study demonstrates that pharmacists, on average, verified more orders when working from home, and they also perceive themselves as being more productive. The results of this study support long-term applicability of a flexible work schedule for inpatient and infusion pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
513,34930681,"The evaluation of mandatory alerts on long-acting opioid prescriptions and the use of a community pharmacy naloxone protocol. BACKGROUND Opioid overdose deaths accounted for approximately 69.5% of the total drug overdoses in the United States in 2018. In the same year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that around 9 million opportunities to dispense naloxone to high-risk patients were missed. Community pharmacists are equipped to help all patients obtain naloxone to prevent opioid-related overdoses. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of mandatory alerts on the dispensing of naloxone by pharmacists using a physician-approved protocol. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the change in the number of dispensed naloxone prescriptions via physician-approved protocol compared with the same time period in the previous year. The secondary objective was to evaluate the pharmacists' knowledge and confidence dispensing naloxone via physician-approved protocol. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION A system-generated mandatory alert that prompted pharmacists to assess the need for naloxone and initiate and dispense as appropriate via a physician-approved protocol was implemented in 5 pharmacies of a large community pharmacy chain between June and July 2020. PRACTICE INNOVATION A technology enhancement was designed that automatically created a mandatory alert in the pharmacy management system for all patients who were dispensed a long-acting opioid medication to prompt pharmacists to initiate and dispense naloxone as appropriate. EVALUATION METHODS The impact of the mandatory alert was evaluated by assessing patients' medication fill history in the pharmacy management system to determine the change in naloxone prescriptions dispensed. RESULTS During the intervention period, pharmacists initiated and dispensed 34 incremental naloxone prescriptions via a physician-approved protocol compared with the same time period in the previous year. CONCLUSION The results illustrated that system-generated mandatory alerts prompting pharmacist intervention can effectively increase pharmacist utilization of a physician-approved protocol, resulting in increased naloxone prescriptions dispensed to high-risk patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

515,34930790,"Initial evaluation of a brief pharmacy-led intervention to modify beliefs about medicines and facilitate adherence among patients hospitalised with acute coronary syndrome. OBJECTIVES Medication non-adherence is common among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. To date, pharmacists have been underutilised in the delivery of adherence interventions. Across two studies, we assessed the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a novel pharmacy-led intervention for patients hospitalised with ACS. METHODS The theory-based intervention was comprised of two personalised sessions addressing perceptual (negative/erroneous treatment beliefs) and practical (suboptimal action planning) barriers to adherence. Study 1: A single-arm, feasibility and acceptability study was conducted to determine proof-of-concept. Pre-post-comparisons using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-Specific (BMQ-S) were made. Study 2: A non-randomised controlled before-after pilot study was conducted with the intervention delivered by a team of clinical pharmacists. Follow-up data were collected at 6 and 12 weeks post-discharge. Primary outcome measures included the BMQ-S and the Medication Adherence Report Scale 5. RESULTS Study 1: 15 patients received the intervention and reported higher BMQ-S necessity scores post-intervention. The intervention was deemed highly acceptable to patients; therefore, further testing was sought. Study 2: A total of 56 patients were recruited: control (n=29) versus treatment (n=27). At 6-week follow-up, the treatment group had higher BMQ-S necessity scores (M=21.8, SD=3.1) compared with control (M=19.8, SD=2.7; p=0.045), although this effect was not maintained at 12 weeks. No differences were reported in the other outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Although the intervention was acceptable to patients, poor fidelity in delivery raises questions about its feasibility in practice. Furthermore, there was some impact on patients' beliefs about medications but no effect on adherence. These findings demonstrate the importance of conducting feasibility and acceptability studies when developing adherence innovations in clinical care. Future studies should consider enhancing the training process to ameliorate fidelity issues.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Inpatient,
516,34930791,"EAHP European Statements Survey 2018, focusing on Section 1: Introductory Statements and Governance, Section 3: Production and Compounding, and Section 4: Clinical Pharmacy Services. OBJECTIVES The 2018 EAHP European Statements Survey focused on sections 1, 3 and 4 of the European Statements of Hospital Pharmacy. Statistical data on the level of implementation and on the main barriers to implementation of the Statements were collected. A further aim was to identify barriers in general, such as lack of awareness. METHODS An online questionnaire was sent to all hospital pharmacies in EAHP member countries. Data were analysed at Keele University School of Pharmacy, UK. As with previous reports, the survey was divided into three sections: section A, asking general questions about the hospital pharmacy; Section B, addressing questions about the current activity of pharmacists around each statement from Sections 1, 3 and 4; and Section C, focusing on their ability to implement the statements. RESULTS 719 complete responses were obtained from a sample of 5164 hospital pharmacies, giving a response rate of 14% (719/5164). Section A results indicated that 45% (323/719) of responders worked in teaching hospitals, 79% (568/719) of hospital pharmacies had 10 or fewer pharmacists, and 48% (345/719) of hospital pharmacies served over 500 beds. Section B results found a high percentage of positive responses for activity in section 1 (introductory statements and governance) and section 3 (production and compounding). However, responses to questions in section 4 (clinical pharmacy services) were more variable, with 6 of the 15 questions being answered positively by less than half of respondents. The five questions that revealed the lowest implementation levels were then analysed in greater detail. These questions corresponded to Statements 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 1.1, and 4.2, which need the greatest effort for implementation. The major identified barriers to implementation were 'lack of capacity' and that 'other health professionals in the hospital fulfil the tasks'. CONCLUSIONS This survey provides useful information on the implementation status (and the barriers to, and drivers of implementation) of sections 1, 3 and 4 of the Statements. This will allow the EAHP to plan its implementation support programme for its members. To increase the quality of data, as well as the feedback to hospital pharmacies, the EAHP is planning to combine the survey with the self-assessment tool of the European Statements of Hospital Pharmacy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
517,34930792,"Changing the medication documentation process for discharge: impact on clinical routine and documentation quality-a process analysis. OBJECTIVES In 2017, an in-house best-practice process for medication documentation was developed and implemented to meet the new German legal requirements concerning the management of patient discharge from the hospital. Because this law regulates the common steps of good discharge practices (eg, specification of discharge mediation documentation), we used its implementation to assess the impact of such a measure on the quality of medication documentation and related workflows in clinical routine. METHODS By observing workflows and interviewing the affected employees, we analysed the medication workflow processes from admission to discharge of seven representative departments of a large university hospital before and early after implementation of a newly defined best-practice process. To investigate the implementation impact, following measures were determined overall and for five key process steps: quality of medication documentation as measured by predefined criteria, the adherence to the best-practice process (range 0%-100%), workload and potential shifts in responsibilities. RESULTS Already early after implementation, all departments met the legal requirements and the quality of the medication documentation increased from low to high quality in most departments. Mean adherence to the best-practice process was 77% (range 60%-100%) with strictest adherence of 100% in one department. Thereby, the number of process steps and hence, likely also the workload increased in all departments. New tasks were mainly performed by physicians and in one department by pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS The new lawful best-practice process led to a higher quality in medication documentation at the cost of a higher workload for physicians, potentially limiting time for other care tasks. Therefore, it could be important to define areas of the medication documentation process in which physicians could be supported by other professions or new tools facilitating accurate medication documentation as the basis of continuity of care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the role of the clinical pharmacist in improving venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis prescription in patients with renal impairment (RI). METHODS This was an interventional cross-sectional study conducted in a nephrology ward. Patients' risk scores for VTE and bleeding during hospitalisation (evaluated by the Caprini Risk Assessment Model (RAM), Padua Prediction Score and IMPROVE Bleeding Risk Score, respectively), and the rate of VTE prophylaxis administration to patients, were evaluated before and after a clinical pharmacist's intervention. RESULTS In the pre-intervention phase, 34.8% of high-VTE-risk patients, of whom 12.5% were also at high risk of bleeding, received pharmacological prophylaxis. Moreover, 22.2% of low-VTE-risk patients received prophylaxis. In the intervention phase, prophylaxis was administered to all high-risk patients (mechanical prophylaxis in 7% of patients with a high risk of both VTE and bleeding, and heparin in the remainder) and to 3.3% of those at low risk of VTE.

Although polypharmacy is common among patients on hemodialysis (HD), its association with prognosis remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the association between the number of prescribed medicines and all-cause mortality in patients on HD, accounting for essential medicines (i.e., antihypertensives, antidiabetic medicines, and statins) and non-essential medicines. We evaluated 339 patients who underwent maintenance HD at Nagasaki Renal Center between July 2011 and June 2012 and followed up until June 2021. After adjusting for patient characteristics, the number of regularly prescribed medicines (10.0 ± 4.0) was not correlated with prognosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.05, p = 0.60). However, the number of non-essential medicines (7.9 ± 3.6) was correlated with prognosis (HR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, p = 0.009). Adjusting for patient characteristics, patients who were prescribed more than 10 non-essential medicines were found to have a significantly higher probability of mortality than those prescribed less than five non-essential medicines, with a relative risk of 2.01 (p = 0.004). In conclusion, polypharmacy of non-essential medicines increases the risk of all-cause mortality in patients on HD. As such, prescribing essential medicines should be prioritized, and the clinical relevance of each medicine should be reviewed by physicians and pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

523,34931699,"Intervention fidelity and process outcomes of the IMMENSE study, a pharmacist-led interdisciplinary intervention to improve medication safety in older hospitalized patients. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE The majority of hospitalized older patients experience medication-related problems (MRPs), and there is a call for interventions to solve MRPs and improve clinical outcomes like medical visits. The IMMENSE study is a randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of a pharmacist-led interdisciplinary intervention on emergency medical visits. Its multistep intervention is based on the integrated medicines management methodology and includes a follow-up step with primary care. This study aims to describe how the intervention in the IMMENSE study was delivered and its process outcomes. METHODS The study includes the 221 intervention patients in the per-protocol group of the IMMENSE study. Both intervention delivery, reasons for not performing interventions and process outcomes were registered daily by the study pharmacists in a Microsoft Access® database. Process outcomes were medication discrepancies, MRPs and how the team solved these. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 121 (54.8%) patients received all intervention steps if appropriate. All patients received medication reconciliation (MedRec) and medication Review (MedRev) (step 1 and 2), while between 10% and 20% of patients were missed for medication list in discharge summary (step 3), patient counselling (step 4), or communication with general practitioner and nurse (step 5). A total of 437 discrepancies were identified in 159 (71.9%) patients during MedRec, and 1042 MRPs were identified in 209 (94.6%) patients during MedRev. Of these, 292 (66.8%) and 700 (67.2%), respectively, were communicated to and solved by the interdisciplinary team during the hospital stay. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The fidelity of the single steps of the intervention was high even though only about half of the patients received all intervention steps. The impact of the intervention may be influenced by not implementing all steps in all patients, but the many discrepancies and MRPs identified and solved for the patients could explain a potential effect of the IMMENSE study.",1,1,0,0,0,Results do not show comparison even though method is described as a randomized controlled trial.,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Children with cancer may be one of the most vulnerable groups to drug-related adverse events because they possess characteristics of patients with cancer as well as pediatric patients. To evaluate the clinical and economic impact of pharmacists' intervention on the care of pediatric hematology and oncology patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings of a children's hospital. METHODS The pharmacist-intervention records from 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Intervention rate, type of drug-related problems, acceptance rate, and frequently involved drugs in pharmacist interventions were analyzed. One physician and one pharmacist evaluated the clinical significance of each intervention. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted from hospital and patient perspective. The benefit from cost savings by reducing the number of prescribed drugs that are disposed was estimated as the benefit from hospital perspective. The benefit from cost avoidance based on the potential to avoid an adverse drug event (ADE) was estimated as the benefit from patient perspective. The cost of reviewing prescriptions was estimated based on the pharmacists' salary and the time involved. RESULTS In 2017, 2361 interventions were performed in 381 pediatric patients with cancer. The acceptance rate was 97.2%. More than half of the interventions were regarded as clinically ""significant"" (58.8%) and ""very significant"" (14.6%). The cost-benefit of US$28,705 was determined from hospital perspective, with a cost-benefit ratio of 1.45:1. The cost-benefit of US$35,611 was calculated from patient perspective, with a cost-benefit ratio of 1.55:1. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists' intervention in the care of hematology and oncology pediatric patients was effective in preventing clinically significant ADEs and had a positive economic impact on the health-care budget from both hospital and patient perspective.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
525,34932001,"An Integrated Model to Improve Medication Reconciliation in Oncology: Prospective Interventional Study. BACKGROUND Accurate medication reconciliation reduces the risk of drug incompatibilities and adverse events that can occur during transitions in care. Community pharmacies (CPs) are a crucial part of the health care system and could be involved in collecting essential information on conventional and supplementary drugs used at home. OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper was to establish an alliance between our cancer institute, Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST), and CPs, the latter entrusted with the completion of a pharmacological recognition survey. We also aimed to integrate the national information technology (IT) platform of CPs with the electronic medical records of IRST. METHODS Cancer patients undergoing antiblastic treatments were invited to select a CP taking part in the study and to complete the pharmacological recognition step. The information collected by the pharmacist was sent to the electronic medical records of IRST through the new IT platform, after which the oncologist performed the reconciliation process. RESULTS A total of 66 CPs completed surveys for 134 patients. An average of 5.9 drugs per patient was used at home, with 12 or more used in the most advanced age groups. Moreover, 60% (80/134) of the patients used nonconventional products or critical foods. Some potential interactions between nonconventional medications and cancer treatments were reported. CONCLUSIONS In the PROF-1 (Progetto di Rete in Oncologia con le Farmacie di comunità della Romagna) study, an alliance was created between our cancer center and CPs to improve medication reconciliation, and a new integrated IT platform was validated.

526,34932206,"Patient Safety Incidents Related to the Use of Parenteral Nutrition in All Patient Groups: A Systematic Scoping Review. INTRODUCTION There is limited comprehensive literature focussing on the range of patient safety incidents related to parenteral nutrition (PN). OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to examine patient safety incidents related to the use of PN in all patient age groups. METHODS Literature published in the English language between January 2000 and April 2020 were searched across the MEDLINE, CINHAL and Embase databases. Articles were included if they contained PN-related patient safety incidents related to an avoidable event. No restrictions were applied to patient populations. The screening process was undertaken independently by two authors. RESULTS In total, 108 records were included in the review: 52 case studies, 54 observation studies (e.g. prevalence studies, surveys) and two experimental studies. All age groups were represented, with 62% of studies in paediatrics (of which two-thirds were neonates) and 23% in adults. They included all medication processes: prescribing, dispensing, compounding, administration and monitoring. Incidents were related to microbial contamination, venous access and specific components (e.g. lipid emulsion, amino acids, glucose, micronutrients and electrolytes) or the whole product. Incident outcomes ranging from near miss to death were reported. Intervention studies looked at the impact on patient safety incidents of computerised tools, healthcare processes, e.g. pharmacist screening, and standardisation. One study demonstrated more severe outcomes with paediatric than with adult PN. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrates the vast range of PN-related patient safety incidents in all patient age groups and all medication process stages. The need for a national study looking at patient safety incidents related to PN in England is highlighted.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
527,34933705,"Knowledge, Use and Practices of Licensed Dietitians Related to Dietary Supplements in Lebanon. OBJECTIVE To evaluate Lebanese licensed dietitians' (LDs) knowledge, prevalence of use and recommendation of dietary supplements (DS), and their associated factors. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING Dietitians across Lebanon were contacted through the telephone and were asked to participate in the study. An online self-administered questionnaire was designed and sent to dietitians either by email or by WhatsApp, between March 4th and May 4th, 2020. PARTICIPANTS This study included 319 dietitians randomly selected from the dietitians' list that was provided by Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. RESULTS Around 75% of dietitians had a knowledge score above 50%. Overall, 73.7% of them have used DS and 46.1% have recommended them. Higher knowledge score was associated with less years of experience, using scientific articles as source of information on DS, and participating in research. Resorting to pharmacists was significantly associated with both nutrient supplements (NS) and herbal supplements' (HS) use, whereas referring to health food stores was associated with HS use only. NS recommendation to patients was associated with personal NS use (OR=3.38, P<0.001), considering pharmacists as a source of information on DS (OR=2.29, P=0.01) and discussing DS with patients (OR=3.82, P=0.01). Having personally used HS (OR=12.23, P<0.001) and having discussed DS with patients (OR=8.51, P=0.01) increased the likelihood of recommending HS. CONCLUSIONS A proper DS education, the elaboration of national scientific guidelines and the implementation of concise laws regarding the regulations of DS would play a crucial role in supporting dietitians' practices and improving the quality of patient care with respect to DS.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
528,34933882,"The 2018 Global Point Prevalence Survey of antimicrobial consumption and resistance in 47 Canadian hospitals: a cross-sectional survey. BACKGROUND Patient-level surveillance of antimicrobial use (AMU) in Canadian hospitals empowers the reduction of inappropriate AMU and was piloted in 2017 among 14 hospitals in Canada. We aimed to describe AMU on the basis of patient-level data in Canadian hospitals in 2018 in terms of antimicrobial prescribing prevalence and proportions, antimicrobial indications, and agent selection in medical, surgical and intensive care wards. METHODS Canadian adult, pediatric and neonatal hospitals were invited to participate in the standardized web-based cross-sectional Global Point Prevalence Survey of Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance (Global-PPS) conducted in 2018. An identified site administrator assigned all wards admitting inpatients to specific surveyors. A physician, pharmacist or nurse with infectious disease training performed the survey. The primary outcomes were point prevalence rates for AMU over the study period regarding prescriptions, indications and agent selection in medical, surgical and intensive care wards. The secondary outcomes were AMU for resistant organisms and practice appropriateness evaluated on the basis of quality indicators. Antimicrobial consumption is presented in terms of prevalence and proportions. RESULTS Forty-seven of 118 (39.8%) hospitals participated in the survey; 9 hospitals were primary care centres, 15 were secondary care centres and 23 were tertiary or specialized care centres. Of 13 272 patients included, 33.5% (n = 4447) received a total of 6525 antimicrobials. Overall, 74.1% (4832/6525) of antimicrobials were for therapeutic use, 12.6% (n = 825) were for medical prophylaxis, 8.9% (n = 578) were for surgical prophylaxis, 2.2% (n = 143) were for other use and 2.3% (n = 147) were for unidentified reasons. A diagnosis or indication was documented in the patient's file at the initiation for 87.3% (n = 5699) of antimicrobials; 62.9% (n = 4106) of antimicrobials had a stop or review date; and 72.0% (n = 4697) of prescriptions were guided by local guidelines. INTERPRETATION Overall, three-quarters of AMU was for therapeutic use across participating hospitals. Canadian hospitals should be further incentivized to create and adapt local guidelines on the basis of recent antimicrobial resistance data.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

530,34933977,"Evaluation of 2 Intervention Models to Integrate Family Planning Into Worker Health and Livelihood Programs in Egypt: A Difference-in-Differences Analysis.  Recent increases in fertility rates in Egypt and an increase in desired fertility among unmarried young people highlight the need for renewed attention to awareness of and demand for family planning (FP) among young people. Between 2017 and 2018, the United States Agency for International Development-funded Evidence Project tested 2 intervention models to increase awareness of and demand for FP and reproductive health (RH) services among people aged 18-35 years in Souhag and Port Said governorates, Egypt. In Souhag, FP/RH information was integrated into a 5-day livelihood training program for job seekers. In Port Said, garment factory workers received FP/RH information through trained peer educators, social and behavior change materials, and social media. Workshop participants and factory workers interested in FP services were referred to private project-trained physicians and pharmacists. We present the results of an evaluation of the impact of each intervention on young people's reported exposure to FP messages and their FP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Phone interviews were conducted with participants in intervention and comparison groups before and after the intervention. In Souhag, 1,519 intervention group participants (778 at baseline; 741 at endline) and 1,082 comparison group participants (699 at baseline; 383 at endline) completed the phone interview. In Port Said 1,958 participants from intervention factories (1,145 at baseline; 813 at endline) and 1,047 participants from comparison factories (621 at baseline; 426 at endline) completed the phone interview. A difference-in-differences analysis compared intervention and comparison groups between baseline and endline. Results showed significant differences in knowledge and attitudes over time between the intervention and comparison groups in Souhag but less so in Port Said. FP use did not change among project participants in either governorate. We discuss lessons learned from integrating FP into worker health and livelihood training programs and methodological considerations for evaluating such interventions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
531,34933980,"Using a Pharmacy-Based Surveillance System to Improve Standards for TB Care in Kerala, India. INTRODUCTION Eleven anti-TB drugs were included in the Government of India's Schedule H1 drug regulations in 2014. The National Strategic Plan for TB Elimination in India 2017-2025 recognized the opportunity to strengthen the TB surveillance system and improve the quality of TB care by implementing the Schedule H1 regulation. However, there were no documented systematic large-scale efforts to use Schedule H1 regulation to support TB surveillance or improve the quality of care. We aimed to document the process of implementation of the Schedule H1 regulation to enhance the quality of TB care and strengthen the TB surveillance system in Kerala, India. METHODS We conducted 33 in-depth interviews of the drugs control department enforcement officers, chemist shop owners, private-sector doctors, leaders of professional medical associations, and program managers and key staff of the TB Elimination Program in Kerala. Major themes identified were the process of implementation of Schedule H1 and how the National TB Elimination Program used the information. Findings from the qualitative interviews were corroborated with the quantitative information from the annual program performance reports and anti-TB drug sales data. RESULTS The TB Elimination Program of Kerala used the information from the Schedule H1 drug register to identify the missing TB cases and strengthen TB notification, identify providers for engagement and extend support to them for ensuring standards of TB care, and provide feedback to providers regarding prescription practices. Stakeholders felt that implementation of Schedule H1 surveillance has helped to improve TB patient notifications from the private sector, build better public-private partnerships, and improve the quality of TB diagnosis and treatment in Kerala. CONCLUSION Pharmacy-based drug sales data collected either through regulatory or non-regulatory methods have immense potential to support TB elimination programs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
532,34933984,"Effects of Pharmacist Intervention on Community Control of Hypertension: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Zunyi, China. OBJECTIVE We aimed to test the effects of pharmacist intervention on the community control of hypertension through a comparative randomized controlled trial. METHODS We recruited adult hypertensive patients with comorbidity or confusion with medication (n=636) from 2 community health centers in Zunyi, China. They were randomly and equally divided into 2 groups. Both groups received the usual care and participated in the community systematic management program of hypertension. Participants in the intervention group were given interventions from pharmacists, including a monthly review of medications, patient education, and medication adjustment advice to medical doctors over 6 months. Participants' blood pressure was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Participants' knowledge and medication adherence were measured using a questionnaire before and after the trial. RESULTS Compared to the control group (n=298), a significantly higher percentage of participants in the intervention group (n=290) had their blood pressure under control 3 months (46.9% vs. 38.3%, P=.034) and 6 months (60.7% vs. 40.9%, P<.001) after the interventions. Difference-in-differences analyses showed that the pharmacist intervention resulted in an increase in knowledge scores by 12.55 points (P<.001), a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 6.65 mmHg (P=.001), and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure by 7.26 mmHg (P<.001) compared to the controls after adjustment for variations in potential confounding factors. The odds of participants passing the hypertension knowledge tests in the intervention group was 4.45 times those in the control group (P<.001). Similarly, it was found that the intervention group had higher odds of not needing any medication adjustments (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.75, P<.001) and having their blood pressure under control (AOR=2.18, P=.002) compared to the control group. CONCLUSION It is evident that pharmacist intervention has significant short-term effects on improving the knowledge and medication adherence of hypertensive patients, as well as timely medication adjustments from medical doctors, resulting in lowered blood pressure and an increased control rate. Further studies should explore the long-term sustainability of the effects of community pharmacist intervention.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Community,
533,34935258,"Swallowing the pill of adverse effects: A qualitative study of patients' and pharmacists' experiences and decision-making regarding the adverse effects of chronic pain medications. INTRODUCTION Pharmacological treatments of chronic pain can lead to numerous and sometimes serious adverse effects. Drawing on a social science approach to chronic illness, this study aimed to understand the experiences of people living with chronic pain and community pharmacists regarding the definition, prevention and management of analgesic adverse effects. METHODS This qualitative study proceeded through 12 online focus groups (FGs) with people living with chronic pain (n = 26) and community pharmacists (n = 19), conducted between July 2020 and February 2021 in the province of Quebec, Canada. The semistructured discussion guides covered participants' definitions of adverse effects and decision-making regarding their prevention and management. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using grounded theory. RESULTS Both people with chronic pain and pharmacists provided varying definitions of analgesic adverse effects depending on patients' social and clinical characteristics. Present quality of life and serious long-term risks related to treatment were described as key dimensions influencing adverse effect appraisal. Dilemmas and discrepancies occurred between patients and pharmacists when choosing to prioritize pain relief or adverse effect prevention. Some patients lacked information about their medications and wanted to be more involved in decisions, while many pharmacists were concerned by patients' self-management of adverse effects. Preventing opioid-related overdoses often led pharmacists to policing practices. Despite most pharmacists wishing they could have a key role in the management of pain and adverse effects face organizational and financial barriers. CONCLUSION Defining, preventing and managing adverse effects in the treatment of chronic pain requires a person-centred approach and shared decision-making. Clinical training improvements and healthcare organization changes are needed to support pharmacists in providing patients with community-based follow-up and reliable information about the adverse effects of chronic pain treatments. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION A person with lived experience of chronic pain was involved as a coinvestigator in the study. He contributed to shaping the study design and objectives, including major methodological decisions such as the choice of pharmacists as the most appropriate professionals to investigate. In addition, 26 individuals with chronic pain shared their experiences extensively during the FGs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

535,34935546,"A pilot study about methods to reduce prescription errors in a chemotherapy day unit - Aspects to consider in pharmacist verification process. INTRODUCTION Prescribing errors can happen unintentionally during the prescribing process, or when choosing a treatment therapy. Prescribing errors have the highest prevalence amongst common error types related to chemotherapy medication in outpatient settings. According to the Joint Commission International (JCI), prescriptions should be reviewed for appropriateness by someone else than the prescriber or practitioner to prevent medication errors. AIM The study was aimed to map out the existing type and amount of occurring deviations in prescribing and to clarify the current chemotherapy prescribing practices at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Helsinki University Hospital. Similar research has not been published in Finland before. METHODS AND PATIENTS The researcher selected patients randomly from the daily outpatient attendance list following a predetermined numerical order. Data was collected by conducting a medication verification review in line with the JCI guidance by a clinical pharmacist the day before the patient's clinic appointment using the available medical documentation. A clinical pharmacist evaluated findings from prescriptions and contacted an oncologist if the findings were considered clinically significant. RESULTS A clinical pharmacist verified prescriptions from 101 patients for appropriateness and found discrepancies in four percent of the prescriptions (n = 4/101). The oncologist approved 50 percent of the suggested amendments by the pharmacist as clinically significant (n = 2/4). The study revealed that patient's regular home medications were not always correctly recorded into the database, so verification of medicine interactions could not be trusted as completely accurate. It took on average 16 min per patient to perform a medication verification review. The process was slowed down by the lack of detailed enough protocols for this purpose and the current patient care record system not having structural formatting of data entry. CONCLUSIONS Verification of prescriptions provides a tool to identify prescribing discrepancies and to prevent unintended medication errors affecting patients. The development of detailed protocols and guidelines, as well as an appropriate training program, would support pharmacists in compiling clinical medication reviews for chemotherapy patients. More research is needed to further develop the operating model in Finland. Information gathered from this study can be used for identifying training requirements.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
536,34935733,"Knowledge and Perceived Effectiveness of Infection Prevention and Control Measures Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey. BACKGROUND Being the first line of defense against COVID-19 infection, health care workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of getting infected.

537,34936661,"Understanding the implementation, impact and sustainable use of an electronic pharmacy referral service at hospital discharge: A qualitative evaluation from a sociotechnical perspective. INTRODUCTION The transition of patients across care settings is associated with a high risk of errors and preventable medication-related harm. Ensuring effective communication of information between health professionals is considered important for improving patient safety. A National Health Service(NHS) organisation in the North West of England introduced an electronic transfer of care around medicines (TCAM) system which enabled hospital pharmacists to send information about patient's medications to their nominated community pharmacy. We aimed to understand the adoption, and the implications for sustainable use in practice of the TCAM service. METHODS We evaluated the TCAM service in a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and NHS Foundation Trust in Salford, United Kingdom (UK). Participants were opportunistically recruited to take part in qualitative interviews through stakeholder networks and during hospital admission, and included hospital pharmacists, hospital pharmacy technicians, community pharmacists, general practice-based pharmacists, patients and their carers. A thematic analysis, that was iterative and concurrent with data collection, was undertaken using a template approach. The interpretation of the data was informed by broad sociotechnical theory. RESULTS Twenty-three interviews were conducted with health care professionals patients and carers. The ways in which the newly implemented TCAM intervention was adopted and used in practice and the perceptions of it from different stakeholders were conceptualised into four main thematic areas: The nature of the network and how it contributed to implementation, use and sustainability; The material properties of the system; How work practices for medicines safety were adapted and evolved; and The enhancement of medication safety activities. The TCAM intervention was perceived as effective in providing community pharmacists with timely, more accurate and enhanced information upon discharge. This allowed for pharmacists to enhance clinical services designed to ensure that accurate medication reconciliation was completed, and the correct medication was dispensed for the patient. CONCLUSIONS By providing pharmacy teams with accurate and enhanced information the TCAM intervention supported healthcare professionals to establish and/or strengthen interprofessional networks in order to provide clinical services designed to ensure that accurate medication reconciliation and dispensing activities were completed. However, the intervention was implemented into a complex and at times fragmented network, and we recommend opportunities be explored to fully integrate this network to involve patients/carers, general practice pharmacists and two-way communication between primary and secondary care to further enhance the reach and impact of the TCAM service.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
538,34937647,"Electronic transmission of prescriptions in primary care: transformation, timing and teamwork.  INTRODUCTION During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown in New Zealand in March 2020, there was a rapid shift to virtual consultations in primary care. This change was supported by system adjustments to enable electronic transmission of prescriptions without a handwritten signature if they met certain security criteria. International research suggests potential for unintended consequences with such changes, so it is important to understand the effect on professional practice in New Zealand general practice and community pharmacy. AIM The purpose of this study was to undertake a preliminary exploration of the experiences of New Zealand general practitioners and community pharmacists when prescriptions are transmitted electronically directly from prescriber to pharmacy. METHODS Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of four pharmacists and four general practitioners gathered qualitative data about their experiences of the shift to electronic transmission of prescriptions. Participants' perceptions of effect on professional workflow, interprofessional interactions between general practitioners and pharmacists, and interactions with patients were explored. Interviews were audio-recorded, and the data analysed thematically using an inductive approach. RESULTS Four themes were identified: workflow transformation; mixed impact on interactions with patients; juggling timing and expectations; and new avenues for interprofessional communication (with some cul-de-sacs). DISCUSSION Both general practitioners and pharmacists experienced transformational changes to workflow. This was positive for general practitioners due to saved time and increased work flexibility. Pharmacists noted potential benefits but also some challenges. To fully reap teamwork benefits, more work is needed on managing the timing issues and patient expectations, and to refine the new modes of communication between health-care practitioners.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

540,34938396,"Pharmacist-structured review of proton pump inhibitor utilisation in primary care: A nonrandomised control study. Introduction In the primary care setting, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) overutilisation often stems from the failure to discontinue prophylaxis treatment prior to tertiary care discharge and consider step-down therapy following discharge. Long-term PPI use can result in potential drug-related problems and unnecessary drug expenditure. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist-structured review in reducing inappropriate PPI prescriptions and estimate the potential cost saving. Methods This non-randomised controlled study was conducted for 16 weeks at 17 government health clinics in Selangor, Malaysia. Eligible patients attending the outpatient pharmacies of intervention clinics were recruited consecutively and their consent was obtained. A structured review of PPIs was performed in which pharmacists identified patient demographics, indications and the length of PPI therapy using a PPI intervention form. Recommendations were discussed with physicians before prescription changes were made and documented. Moreover, standard management was conducted in the control clinics. Results A total of 568 patients with prescriptions containing PPIs were sampled, with a total of 284 patients being placed into the control and intervention groups, respectively. Compared to the control group, inappropriate PPI utilisation in the intervention group significantly decreased from 79.9 to 30.4% (p<0.05). The changes to PPI prescriptions observed in the intervention group included: stop PPI therapy (30.8%), step-down therapy (22.9%), start substitution therapy (15.9%) and no change (30.4%). The physicians' acceptance rate for pharmacist intervention was 67.8%.

543,34940791,"Decreasing drug waste, reducing drug costs, and improving workflow efficiency through the implementation of automated chemotherapy dose rounding rules in the electronic health record system. PURPOSE To decrease drug waste and cost by implementing automated chemotherapy dose rounding rules in the electronic health record (EHR). Dose rounding of chemotherapy is a recognized method for reducing drug waste, and professional organizations have published guidelines recommending dose rounding when possible. SUMMARY On the basis of current literature and guideline recommendations, Mayo Clinic developed system-wide consensus to allow dose rounding for biologic and chemotherapy agents to the nearest vial size if rounding resulted in the dose being within 10% of the originally calculated dose or to a convenient measurable volume, based on concentration of the drug, if rounding to the nearest vial size resulted in the dose being outside the 10% range. Oncology pharmacists reviewed and analyzed all drugs listed in the EHR used in injectable form for the treatment of cancer and developed dose rounding rules. The rules were implemented and applied at the dose calculation stage before provider signature. From January to June 2019, approximately 40,000 cancer treatment doses were administered. The rounding rules saved a total of 9,814 vials of drug, of which 5,329 were for biologic agents and 4,485 were for oncolytic drugs. This resulted in a total 6-month cost savings of $7,284,796 (in 2019 dollars; biologics, $5,727,402; oncolytics, $1,557,394). CONCLUSION Systematic implementation of dose rounding rules utilizing the EHR can result in significant reduction of drug waste and realization of savings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS) certification is endorsed to distinguish pharmacists for advanced practice areas, yet perceived value to stakeholders remains poorly described. This study characterized how board certification is integrated in hospital pharmacy departments across California. METHODS A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in which a survey was administered to all hospital pharmacy directors in California between November 2019 and March 2020. Licensed institutions and corresponding pharmacy directors were identified from the California State Board of Pharmacy. The survey queried for institution and pharmacy director characteristics and if/how board certification was integrated. Multivariable logistic models identified predictors of institutions with at least 25% full-time board-certified pharmacists and those that reward board certification. RESULTS Surveys were completed by 29% of institutions. Most of these institutions were urban (81%) and nonteaching (57%), with fewer than 325 hospital beds (71%), and with fewer than 50 full-time pharmacist positions (86%). The majority reported that less than 25% of their pharmacists were board certified. Currently, 47% consider board certification during hiring and 38% reward board-certified employees. Predictors of institutions with 25% or more board-certified pharmacists included being a teaching institution (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-7.06), having 325 or more beds (OR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.86-17.97), and having a pharmacy director who was previously or currently board certified (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.46-9.35). Hospitals with 100 or more pharmacist positions predicted institutions that reward board certification (OR, 16.69; 95% CI, 1.78-156.86).

545,34941623,"The Impact of a Pharmacist-Driven Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Initiative in a Community Hospital: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis. PURPOSE Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia with a 30-day mortality of 20%. This study evaluated outcomes after implementation of a pharmacist-driven Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) initiative in a community hospital. METHODS This retrospective cohort analysis compared patients admitted with SAB between May 2015 and April 2018 (intervention group) to those admitted between May 2012 and April 2015 (historical control group). Pharmacists were notified of and responded to blood cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus by contacting provider(s) with a bundle of recommendations. Components of the SAB bundle included prompt source control, selection of appropriate intravenous antibiotics, appropriate duration of therapy, repeat blood cultures, echocardiography, and infectious diseases consult. Demographics (age, gender, and race) were collected at baseline. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Compliance with bundle components was also assessed. RESULTS Eighty-three patients in the control group and 110 patients in the intervention group were included in this study. Demographics were similar at baseline. In-hospital mortality was lower in the intervention group (3.6% vs. 15.7%; p = 0.0033). Bundle compliance was greater in the intervention group (69.1% vs. 39.8%; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS We observed a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality and increased treatment bundle compliance in the intervention cohort with implementation of a pharmacist-driven SAB initiative. Pharmacists' participation in the care of SAB patients in the form of recommending adherence to treatment bundle components drastically improved clinical outcomes. Widespread adoption and implementation of similar practice models at other institutions may reduce in-hospital mortality for this relatively common and life-threatening infection.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
546,34941624,"Understanding the Potential for Pharmacy Expertise in Palliative Care: The Value of Stakeholder Engagement in a Theoretically Driven Mapping Process for Research.  Potentially avoidable medication-related harm is an inherent risk in palliative care; medication management accounts for approximately 20% of reported serious incidents in England and Wales. Despite their expertise benefiting patient care, the routine contribution of pharmacists in addressing medication management failures is overlooked. Internationally, specialist pharmacist support for palliative care services remains under-resourced. By understanding experienced practices ('what happens in the real world') in palliative care medication management, compared with intended processes ('what happens on paper'), patient safety issues can be identified and addressed. This commentary demonstrates the value of stakeholder engagement and consultation work carried out to inform a scoping review and empirical study. Our overall goal is to improve medication safety in palliative care. Informal conversations were undertaken with carers and various specialist and non-specialist professionals, including pharmacists. Themes were mapped to five steps: decision-making, prescribing, monitoring and supply, use (administration), and stopping and disposal. A visual representation of stakeholders' understanding of intended medicines processes was produced. This work has implications for our own and others' research by highlighting where pharmacy expertise could have a significant additional impact. Evidence is needed to support best practice and implementation, particularly with regard to supporting carers in monitoring and accessing medication, and communication between health professionals across settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES (1) To describe the experiences of community pharmacists in transitions of care (TOC) from hospital to home in a Midwestern metropolis; and (2) to develop instruments to measure perceived importance of TOC activities. METHODS Survey items were developed, including a six-item instrument to capture perceived importance of TOC activities. The items were piloted to examine face validity before dissemination to 310 community pharmacists. Descriptive statistics were reported. Principal component analysis and reliability analysis for the six-item instrument were performed to assess construct validity and Cronbach's alpha, respectively. RESULTS The response rate was 37% (n = 118). The majority of community pharmacists estimated that they learned of a patient's discharge on less than 10% of the occasions. There were 76 cases in which the discharged patients experienced either a prescription- or medication-related problem. For the six-item measurement of perceived importance, one component was yielded and all items loaded on the component with high values, which confirmed construct validity. The Cronbach's alpha for these six items was 0.941, indicating high reliability. CONCLUSIONS A large communication gap existed for community pharmacists to receive patient discharge information.

Medicines are the most used health technology in Long-Term Care. The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medicines amongst Long-Term Care patients is high. Pharmacists, assisted by prescribing-assessment tools, can play an important role in optimizing medication use at this level of care. Through a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, 13 long-term care and hospital pharmacists assessed as 'appropriate', 'uncertain', or 'inappropriate' a collection of commonly used prescribing-assessment tools as to its suitability in assisting pharmacy practice in institutional long-term care settings. A qualitative analysis of written or transcribed comments of participants was pursued to identify relevant characteristics of prescribing-assessment tools and potential hinders in their use. From 24 different tools, pharmacists classified 9 as 'appropriate' for pharmacy practice targeted to long-term care patients, while 3 were classified as 'inappropriate'. The tools feature most appreciated by study participants was the indication of alternatives to potentially inappropriate medication.

Pharmacist shortages in rural communities underscore the need to focus on increasing the pipeline of pharmacists practicing rurally. Experiential placement in rural communities is one method to approach this challenge. Regional pharmacy campuses may facilitate rural experiential placements. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a regional campus on the number of rural experiential placements. This retrospective analysis compared experiential student placements in the five-year periods before and after the addition of a regional school of pharmacy campus. Experiential placements in the designated time periods were compared with respect to numbers of overall pharmacy practice experiences, experiences in rural locations, and rural counties with rotation sites. The average distance to rural sites was also compared. Differences in rural experiential placements were not statistically different. The number of rural counties with pharmacy experiential placements grew from eight to twelve, and driving distance increased. While institution of a regional campus contributed to an increase in the number of rural counties with experiential placements, overall rural experiential placements did not statistically differ versus suburban placements. Additional inquiry into factors that affect rural placement is needed to influence strategies to develop and maintain rural experiential sites and consistently place students at those sites.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Research exploring the integration of pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing by pharmacists into their primary care practices (including community pharmacies) has focused on the ""external"" factors that impact practice implementation. In this study, additional ""internal"" factors, related to the capabilities, opportunities, and motivations of pharmacists that influence their ability to implement PGx testing, were analyzed. Semi-structured interview data from the Pharmacists as Personalized Medicine Experts (PRIME) study, which examined the barriers and facilitators to implementing PGx testing by pharmacists into primary care practice, were analyzed. Through thematic analysis, using the theoretical domains framework (TDF) domains as deductive codes, the authors identified the most relevant TDF domains and applied the behavioural change wheel (BCW) to generate intervention types to aid in the implementation of PGx testing. Pharmacists described how their professional identities, practice environments, self-confidence, and beliefs in the benefits of PGx impacted their ability to provide a PGx-testing service. Potential interventions to improve the implementation of the PGx service included preparing pharmacists for managing an increased patient load, helping pharmacists navigate the software and technology requirements associated with the PGx service, and streamlining workflows and documentation requirements. As interest in the wide-scale implementation of PGx testing through community pharmacies grows, additional strategies need to address the ""internal"" factors that influence the ability of pharmacists to integrate testing into their practices.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life for patients. Proper use of inhaler devices is critical for effective drug delivery and prevention of COPD progression. The primary endpoint of this study was a mean percent increase in correct steps associated with inhaler technique after pharmacist education. The co-primary endpoint was a 25% increase in the proportion of patients correctly identifying the appropriate use of short-acting versus long-acting inhaler types. This was an interventional quasi-experimental study of patients hospitalized at a 491-bed tertiary academic medical center with a COPD exacerbation to assess a pharmacist-led COPD care plan. Eligible patients included general floor, adult patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of COPD exacerbation. The primary investigator recorded initial inhaler technique scores through a paper checklist, and provided education about device types and usage.

554,34942135,"Safety, efficacy, and tolerability of memantine for cognitive and adaptive outcome measures in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. BACKGROUND Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder with considerable neurodevelopmental impact and neurodegenerative morbidity. In a pilot trial in young adults with Down syndrome, memantine (a drug approved for Alzheimer's disease) showed a significant effect on a secondary measure of episodic memory. We aimed to test whether memantine would improve episodic memory in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. METHODS We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial with a parallel design, stratified by age and sex. Participants (aged 15-32 years) with either trisomy 21 or complete unbalanced translocation of chromosome 21 and in general good health were recruited from the community at one site in Brazil and another in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either memantine (20 mg/day orally) or placebo for 16 weeks. Computer-generated randomisation tables for both sites (allocating a placebo or drug label to each member of a unique pair of participants) were centrally produced by an independent statistician and were shared only with investigational pharmacists at participating sites until unblinding of the study. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. Neuropsychological assessments were done at baseline (T1) and week 16 (T2). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 16 in the California Verbal Learning Test-second edition short-form (CVLT-II-sf) total free recall score, assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, participants who completed 16 weeks of treatment and had neuropsychological assessments at T1 and T2). Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from the per-protocol population. Safety and tolerability were monitored and analysed in all participants who started treatment. Steady-state concentrations in plasma of memantine were measured at the end of the trial. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02304302. FINDINGS From May 13, 2015, to July 22, 2020, 185 participants with Down syndrome were assessed for eligibility and 160 (86%) were randomly assigned either memantine (n=81) or placebo (n=79). All participants received their allocated treatment. Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from 149 (81%) participants, 73 in the memantine group and 76 in the placebo group, after 11 people (eight in the memantine group and three in the placebo group) discontinued due to COVID-19 restrictions, illness of their caregiver, adverse events, or low compliance. The primary outcome measure did not differ between groups (CVLT-II-sf total free recall score, change from baseline 0·34 points [95% CI -0·98 to 1·67], p=0·61). Memantine was well tolerated, with infrequent mild-to-moderate adverse events, the most common being viral upper respiratory infection (nine [11%] participants in the memantine group and 12 [15%] in the placebo group) and transient dizziness (eight [10%] in the memantine group and six [8%] in the placebo group). No serious adverse events were observed. Amounts of memantine in plasma were substantially lower than those considered therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease. INTERPRETATION Memantine was well tolerated, but cognition-enhancing effects were not recorded with a 20 mg/day dose in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome.

555,34942427,"Operationalizing influenza vaccination in an urban safety-net emergency department. INTRODUCTION Influenza vaccination is a recommended tool in preventing influenza-related illnesses, medical visits, and hospitalizations. With many patients remaining unvaccinated each year, the Emergency Department (ED) represents a unique opportunity to provide vaccinations to patient not yet vaccinated. However, busy urban safety-net EDs maybe challenged to safely execute such a vaccination program. The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess influenza vaccination feasibility in the ED and improve influenza vaccination rates in our community. METHODS The quality improvement work-group, comprised of ED physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, designed and implemented an influenza vaccination protocol that aligned with the ED workflow. The outcome measure was the total number of patients vaccinated per month and per influenza season. Process measures included the type of influenza vaccine administered and type of care area within ED. Balancing measures were also included. RESULTS Following the initiative, a total of 337 patients received influenza vaccinations in the ED between September 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 compared to none during the previous influenza season. With each influenza season, the number of vaccinated patients increased from 61 to 134 and 142, respectively. The average age of the patients was 48.23 ± 15.29, 52.89 ± 15.91, and 44.92 ± 18.97 years old. Most patients received the vaccination while roomed in the high acuity section of the adult ED. No adverse effects or automated dispensing cabinet stockouts were observed. CONCLUSION Our structured program indicates that influenza vaccine administration to eligible patients is feasible in a busy urban safety-net ED.

558,34943655,"Hospital Pharmacists and Antimicrobial Stewardship: A Qualitative Analysis.  Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) in hospitals are predominantly led by specific ASP physicians and pharmacists. Limited studies have been conducted to appreciate non-ASP-trained hospital pharmacists' perspectives on their roles in antimicrobial stewardship. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 74 pharmacists, purposively sampled from the 3 largest acute-care public hospitals in Singapore, to explore facilitators and barriers faced by them in antimicrobial stewardship. Applied thematic analysis was conducted and codes were categorised using the social-ecological model (SEM). At the intrapersonal level, pharmacists identified themselves as reviewers for drug safety before dispensing, confining to a restricted advisory role due to lack of clinical knowledge, experience, and empowerment to contribute actively to physicians' prescribing decisions. At the interpersonal level, pharmacists expressed difficulties conveying their opinions and recommendations on antibiotic therapy to physicians despite frequent communications, but they assumed critical roles as educators for patients and their caregivers on proper antibiotic use. At the organisational level, in-house antibiotic guidelines supported pharmacists' antibiotic interventions and recommendations. At the community level, pharmacists were motivated to improve low public awareness and knowledge on antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance.

There have been various Haemophilia Treatment Centres (HTCs) set up worldwide with innovative blood factor stewardship programs. Pharmacists have been an extended part of stewardship programs providing daily rounds with haematologists, treatment plan modifications, and dosage adjustment recommendations. The Haemophilia Treatment Centres in Malaysia contain the Haemophilia Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (HMTAC), which recruits adolescent and adult populations. There have not been any adherence studies conducted on pharmacist-steered HMTAC since initiation. The current research generates baseline data to produce treatment plans and intervention measures needed for therapy optimisation in the Malaysian population. This study also explores the relationship between medication adherence, bleeding rate, and comorbidity. This cross-sectional study involved retrospective and prospective data collection using the Validated Haemophilia Regimen Treatment Adherence Scale-Prophylaxis (VERITAS-Pro) in Ampang Hospital. The retrospective data collection included reviewing patients' medical records, bleeding diaries, and VERITAS-Pro questionnaires pre-enrolment to HMTAC. Meanwhile, the prospective data collection was the VERITAS-Pro questionnaire administration post a minimum of three months after enrolment. The inclusion criteria were patients with severe haemophilia A and B with ages ≥18 years with self-administered prophylactic regimens for a minimum period of three months. There were six (5.8%) nonadherent participants, and 97 (94.2%) adhered to the preventive treatment. The subscale dosing and remembering and the total score of the VERITAS-Pro post-HMTAC showed a significant association with ABR. There was a significant mean reduction in the post-HMTAC compared to the pre-HMTAC score for the total score and subscales timing, remembering, skipping, and communicating. There was a significant association between the post-HMTAC adherence status and ABR. It can be concluded that the HMTAC service pioneered by the pharmacists in the National Referral Centre of Haematology is efficient in significantly improving the VERITAS-Pro scoring and then translating it into a high medication adherence rate.

564,34948113,"Genophenotypic Factors and Pharmacogenomics in Adverse Drug Reactions.  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) rank as one of the top 10 leading causes of death and illness in developed countries. ADRs show differential features depending upon genotype, age, sex, race, pathology, drug category, route of administration, and drug-drug interactions. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) provides the physician effective clues for optimizing drug efficacy and safety in major problems of health such as cardiovascular disease and associated disorders, cancer and brain disorders. Important aspects to be considered are also the impact of immunopharmacogenomics in cutaneous ADRs as well as the influence of genomic factors associated with COVID-19 and vaccination strategies. Major limitations for the routine use of PGx procedures for ADRs prevention are the lack of education and training in physicians and pharmacists, poor characterization of drug-related PGx, unspecific biomarkers of drug efficacy and toxicity, cost-effectiveness, administrative problems in health organizations, and insufficient regulation for the generalized use of PGx in the clinical setting. The implementation of PGx requires: (i) education of physicians and all other parties involved in the use and benefits of PGx; (ii) prospective studies to demonstrate the benefits of PGx genotyping; (iii) standardization of PGx procedures and development of clinical guidelines; (iv) NGS and microarrays to cover genes with high PGx potential; and (v) new regulations for PGx-related drug development and PGx drug labelling.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The word ""narcotic"" is often first associated with ""illicit drugs"". Yet, many ""narcotic"" and psychotropic substances are, in fact, medicines. Controlled medicines (CM) are products that meet the legal definition of both a ""narcotic"" under the Swiss Narcotics Act and of a medicine under the Therapeutic Products Act. We aim to examine how similar and how different, respectively, the implementation of CM regulations is throughout French-speaking Switzerland. Based on a legal analysis of the cantonal regulations, we conducted semi-structured interviews with cantonal pharmacists and cantonal physicians. We asked them how they perceive and implement the federal legal requirements. We find that some of these requirements have fallen into disuse, notably the federal duty to notify off-label use of CM. We observe that counterfoil prescriptions in their current paper format are a veritable data graveyard in the sense that they are not actively used to monitor or supervise the market. Moreover, we detect different conditions for opioid agonist treatment authorization. Some cantons require additional physicians' training or written commitments by the person treated. Our mapping of the CM regulation implementation can serve as a basis for cantons to review their practices.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
567,34948832,"Polish Pharmacy Students' Readiness, Qualifications, Competences, Relevance, Motivation and Effectiveness to Promote Health in Community Pharmacies. BACKGROUND One of the parts of the broadly understood pharmaceutical care is health promotion. Therefore, the study aimed to find out how pharmacy students in Poland assess their own readiness to promote health in pharmacies and their own qualifications, competences, relevance, motivation and effectiveness of health promotion in pharmacies. METHODS The study conducted in 2019 comprised 206 pharmacy students from Poland. The authors' survey questionnaire had two parts: Readiness to promote health in pharmacies; and Qualifications, competences, relevance, motivation and effectiveness of health promotion in pharmacies. RESULTS The students assessed the system solutions regarding health promotion as insufficient. The highest assessment was given to their own readiness to promote health. In between those was assessment of readiness to promote health by pharmacists as an occupational group. Readiness to promote health at a workplace in a pharmacy was assessed higher than in a local community. The students gave the highest assessments to the relevance and motivation to promote health, and the lowest to their own competences to promote health. In between those, their qualifications and effectiveness to health promotion in pharmacies. were assessed. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy students consider themselves ready and motivated to promote health, that is of a great importance in their opinion, and they could potentially play an important role in improving the health care of patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
568,34949110,"Pharmacists as accessible health care providers: quantifying the opportunity.  BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists are well positioned to improve patient access to care, which may assist value-based care programs in reaching patients. While pharmacy accessibility is broadly acknowledged, much of the research supporting accessibility claims is poor quality. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the accessibility of pharmacists in comparison with physicians or qualified health care professionals (QHP) in a commercially insured population. METHODS: IBM MarketScan claims data from 2018 were used for this cross-sectional study. Beneficiaries included in the primary analysis were aged 18-64 years, enrolled with pharmacy benefits in 2018 for 12 months, and had at least 1 valid prescription drug claim or evaluation and management (E&M) code in 2018. Unique pharmacy visits were defined using a 6-day fill window for prescription fill dates, while visits to physicians or other QHP were defined as unique service dates tied to an E&M code. We assessed differences in visit frequency for the full sample, those with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), and ""superutilizers"" (top 5% based on total cost of care). Our statistical approach included descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon sign rank test. RESULTS: After applying the inclusion criteria, 11,720,958 beneficiaries were included in the full sample. The MCC cohort contained 13.8% of the total sample (mean [SD] age: 50.8 [10.8]; 908,880 [56.1%] female). Finally, the superutilizers were 57.3% female with an average age of 48.4 years and comprised 5.3% of the total sample. The median number of pharmacy and physician or QHP visits for the full sample were 5 and 3 (P < 0.0001), yielding a pharmacy to physician or QHP visit ratio of 1.7:1. The MCC cohort had a median of 13 pharmacy visits and 7 physician or QHP visits (ratio 1.9:1; P < 0.0001), and the superutilizers had a median of 14 pharmacy visits and 9 physician or QHP visits (ratio 1.6:1; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that patients visit their community pharmacies almost twice as often as they visit their physicians or other QHP. Study findings emphasize the accessibility of community pharmacists and highlight the role of community pharmacists in improving patient engagement in all care programs, including value-based care programs.

569,34949114,"The role of managed care pharmacy in coprescribing naloxone for patients with specific risk: recommendations from the AMCP Addiction Advisory Group.  Prescription opioid misuse remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality associated with drug overdose. Researchers, government agencies, public health interests, and professional organizations support the benefits of naloxone coprescribing for patients on chronic opioid therapy to prevent deaths from opioid overdose. However, gaps remain in the provision of naloxone to patients at risk. Currently, less than 1% of patients who should be prescribed naloxone with their opioid medications obtain a prescription for naloxone, illustrating an opportunity for health care providers to conduct thorough risk assessments for patients taking opioids and coprescribing naloxone to those at risk. There are documented barriers to the provision of naloxone for primary care providers, pharmacists, and patients. Managed care organizations have also created barriers. To better understand and evaluate trends in treatment, coverage, policies, and needs associated with providing health services to patients with substance use disorders, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Addiction Advisory Group conducted a survey in 2019. Eighty percent of the managed behavioral health organizations and 47% of AMCP payer members who responded to the survey encouraged naloxone coprescribing in patients at high risk of overdose; however, no organizations require coprescribing. Health plans, managed care organizations, prescribers, pharmacists, patients, and others have important roles in decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid overdose. In particular, managed care organizations can take specific and meaningful actions to implement payment policies that improve naloxone coprescribing for patients at risk. In this article, opportunities have been outlined for managed care leadership that actively support public health policies for naloxone coprescribing, and 7 recommendations are presented. DISCLOSURES: The AMCP Addiction Advisory Group and the development of this article were supported by Alkermes and Precision Toxicology. Sponsors participated in the advisory group, which provided guidance in the development of the manuscript. Dharbhamalla is employed by AMCP.

571,34949612,"Perceptions of pharmacists towards drug shortages in the healthcare system of Pakistan and its impact on patient care: findings from a cross-sectional survey. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to explore pharmacists' perceptions on drug shortages and its impingement on the Pakistani healthcare system, in particular on patient care. DESIGN Online questionnaire survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Hospital pharmacists from five out of seven regions of Pakistan were approached; including the federal territory (Islamabad) and four provinces (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence and type of shortages were identified along with strategies to reduce its effect on patient care. METHOD A validated questionnaire was distributed through various online platforms to 800 registered hospital pharmacists. A convenience sampling technique was used to obtain information on drug shortages, the reporting system for shortages, the impact on patients and policy solutions for managing drug shortages. RESULTS Out of 800 hospital pharmacists, 708 completed the questionnaire (response rate: 88.5%). Of these hospital pharmacists, 47% came from hospitals of Punjab, 26% from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 13% from Sindh, 11% from Balochistan and 4% from Islamabad; 72% and 28% worked in tertiary and secondary hospitals, respectively. The majority (32%) interacted with shortages daily. The top three drug categories reported in shortage were oncology drugs (54%), cardiovascular drugs (53%) and antimicrobials (42%). 58% of the respondents have seen care delayed as a negative consequence of shortages. 'Creating new communication system' (65%) and 'readjust budget plans' (41%) were the two most frequently indicated recommendations for shortages management at hospital, while 'circulars or alerts from the regulatory authority' (60%) and 'time to time directives from local health statuaries' (48%) were two most widely suggested policy solutions. CONCLUSION Drug shortage is a serious concern in Pakistani hospitals, experienced on a daily basis endangering patients' health. Enhanced communication is required, connecting the key stakeholders. Health policies should be reviewed; adequate funds should be allocated to the health sector preventing future shortages.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
572,34949651,"Use of simulation for education in hospital pharmaceutical technologies: a systematic review. OBJECTIVES Because of the inherent risks facing pharmacy technicians, and consequently also patients, initial and continuing education on hospital pharmaceutical technologies is essential. Simulation is a pedagogical tool now widely used in healthcare education. This study's objectives are to provide an overview of simulation's current place in the field of hospital pharmaceutical technology education, to classify these uses, and to discuss how simulation technologies could be better used in the future. DATA SOURCES Two pharmacists independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science on 21 July 2020 and included studies in English or French that used simulation as an educational tool in the field of hospital pharmaceutical technologies, whether in academic teaching or professional practice. DATA SUMMARY Our search criteria resulted in 6248 articles, of which 24 were assessed for eligibility and 13 included in the qualitative synthesis. Simulation in hospital pharmaceutical technology education is used in three different ways: first, as a playful pedagogical tool, with error-based simulations (cleanrooms and preparation sheets with errors), or game-based simulations (escape games, role-plays, and board games); second, as an electronic tool with virtual reality (virtual cleanrooms and serious games), or augmented reality (3D glasses); finally, to evaluate chemical contamination (fluorescein and quinine tests) and microbiological contamination (media-fill tests) during compounding to periodically requalify pharmacy technicians. CONCLUSION Further studies, including non-technical skills evaluations, are needed to confirm the usefulness of this innovative technique in training as efficiently as possible actual and future pharmacy professionals.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

575,34950333,"Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in Community and Primary CareSettings: A Scoping Review. Background Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common tachyarrhythmia and is associated with increased risk of stroke, morbidity and mortality. AF is responsible for up to a quarter of all strokes and is often asymptomatic until a stroke occurs.Screening for AF is a valuable approach to reduce the burden of stroke in the population. Objectives The motivation for this review was to synthesise and appraise the evidence for screening for AF in the community. The aims of this scoping review are 1). To describe the prevalence of newly diagnosed AF in screening programmes 2). Identify which techniques/ tools are employed for AF screening 3). To describe the setting and personnel involved in screening for AF. Eligibility Criteria All forms of AF screening in adults (≥18 years) in primary and community care settings. Methods This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Results Fifty-nine papers were included; most were cross-sectional studies (n=41) and RCTs (n=7). Prevalence of AF ranged from 0-34.5%. Screening tools and techniquesincluded the 12-lead ECG (n=33), the 1-lead ECG smartphone based Alivecor® (n=14) and pulse palpation (n=12). Studies were undertaken in community settings (n=30) or in urban/rural primary care (n=28). Personnel collecting research data were in the main members of the research team (n=31), GPs (n=16), practice nurses (n=10), participants (n=8) and pharmacists (n=4). Conclusion Prevalence of AF increased with advancing age. AF screening should target individuals at greatest risk of the condition including older adults≥65 years of age. Emerging novel technologies may increase the accessibility of AF screening in community and home settings. There is a need for high quality research to investigate AF prevalence and establish accuracy and validity for traditional versus novel screening tools used to screen for AF.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
576,34950768,"Medical Student Screening for Naloxone Eligibility in the Emergency Department: A Value-Added Role to Fight the Opioid Epidemic. Introduction Opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) for use by laypersons are safe and effective at preventing deaths from opioid overdose, but emergency department (ED) implementation is challenging. Curricula addressing OEND could enable students to serve in value-added roles on the clinical team, overcome challenges of naloxone distribution, and improve patient care. Methods We created a 1-hour didactic session on opioid use disorder and OEND for first-year medical students in the emergency medicine elective. During two clinical shifts, students used this knowledge to perform screenings to identify patients at high risk of overdose. If a patient screened positive, students performed patient education and then notified the physician, who ordered a naloxone kit. Results Thirty students received the didactic and conducted screening shifts. Of 147 patients screened, 40% (n = 59) were positive for naloxone eligibility, 21% (n = 31) reported that someone close to them used opioids, 18% (n = 26) had witnessed an opioid overdose, 12% (n = 17) had previously overdosed themselves, and 12% (n = 18) previously knew what naloxone was. Fifty-nine naloxone kits were distributed over the 3-month pilot versus 13 naloxone prescriptions for patients discharged from the ED the prior year. Discussion Through didactic training and structured patient engagement, medical students gained knowledge of and hands-on experience with addiction medicine, discussed sensitive topics with patients, and identified a high volume of patients eligible to receive naloxone. Medical student screening for OEND in ED patients is feasible and adds significant value to the clinical team.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
577,34951117,"Remote Learning During Covid-19 Lockdown: A Study on Anatomy and Histology Education for Pharmacy Students in Jordan.  The Covid-19 pandemic has changed almost all aspects of education. The anatomy and histology courses for pharmacy students focus heavily on the face-to-face communication of theory and practical knowledge and due to the pandemic, only theory content was delivered in an online format. This brought up many concerns about pharmacy student preparedness. This work explores the effectiveness and student perspective of remote teaching of the theoretical anatomy and histology course in Jordanian universities from the perspective of pharmacy students. The objectives are to determine the strengths, challenges, and the effectiveness of remote delivery on student learning. An online-based validated questionnaire was distributed to students majoring in Pharmacy and enrolled in the course during the second semester of 2019-2020 at 11 universities in Jordan. A total of 442 students participated in the study. Results showed that there were significant differences in perceptions of the social media platforms used in distance learning and remote delivery of the course. Most participants had positive perceptions of the educational process and studying via distance learning. There were many strengths noted including time flexibility and several challenges such as the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors, inadequate internet connectivity, and technical issues. In conclusion, online-taught anatomy and histology course during the Covid-19 lockdown in Jordan was a success as perceived by students, but the course still possessed challenges need to be overcome in the future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

580,34951447,"Implementation of a strategy for identification and monitoring of clinical outcome measures in a department of pharmacy. PURPOSE To describe a department of pharmacy strategy to identify and monitor outcome measures that represent the impact of clinical pharmacy services on patient outcomes. SUMMARY Our department established the Clinical Impact Committee, with the goal of developing and maintaining an approach to demonstrate the impact of clinical pharmacists on patient care outcomes. We describe the committee's structure, aims, and key stakeholders, inclusive of both departmental leadership and clinical pharmacist representatives across service lines. We also describe the systematic process used by the committee for identifying clinical outcome measures that are both aligned with organizational priorities and representative of pharmacists' impact. This involved assembly of a crosswalk of clinical outcome measures that are prioritized by the organization and attributable to the work of clinical pharmacists. We found it imperative to connect pharmacists' efforts to the priorities of the organization to demonstrate value and continue to justify pharmacy resources. Once the crosswalk of clinical outcome measures was assembled, the Clinical Impact Committee leveraged modified Delphi methodology to build consensus on the measures to prioritize. Once determined, the final outcome measures were developed into outcomes dashboards, to be monitored by the committee and leveraged by frontline pharmacists. CONCLUSION Our organization was successful in developing a structure, the Clinical Impact Committee, to identify, prioritize, and monitor measures that demonstrate pharmacist contributions to patient care outcomes. Further, our approach includes an intentional alignment with organizational priorities, allowing us to understand and communicate the contributions of our teams to meeting-defined organizational quality priorities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to characterize the current status of medication errors (MEs) throughout the medication therapy process from prescribing to use and monitoring in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in Korea. METHODS Four trained research pharmacists collected data through retrospectively reviewing electronic medical records for adults hospitalized in the MICU in 2017. The occurrence of MEs was determined through interprofessional team discussion led by an academic faculty pharmacist and a medical intensivist based on the medication administration records (MARs). The type of MEs and the consequent ME-related outcome severity were categorized according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe and the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention, respectively. RESULTS Overall, electronic medical records for 293 patients with 78,761 MARs were reviewed in this study. At least one type of ME occurred in 271 patients (92.5%) in association with 16,203 MARs (21%), primarily caused by inappropriate dose (35.5%), drug (27.8%), and treatment duration (25.1%). Clinically significant harmful events occurred in 24 patients (8%), including life-threatening (n = 5) and death (n = 2) cases. The 2 patients died of enoxaparin-induced fatal hemorrhage and neutropenia associated with ganciclovir and cefepime.

582,34951621,"Can inpatient pharmacists move the needle on smoking cessation? Evaluating reach and representativeness of a pharmacist-led opt-out smoking cessation intervention protocol for hospital settings. PURPOSE Hospitalization affords an opportunity to reduce smoking, but fewer than half of patients who smoke receive evidence-based cessation treatment during inpatient stays. This study evaluated a pharmacist-led, electronic health record (EHR)-facilitated opt-out smoking cessation intervention designed to address this need. METHODS Analyses of EHR records for adult patients who smoked in the past 30 days admitted to an academic medical center in the upper Midwest were conducted using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The reach of a pharmacist-led, EHR-facilitated protocol for smoking cessation treatment was assessed by comparing patients' receipt of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and tobacco quitline referral before and after implementation. χ  2 tests, t tests, and multiple logistic regression models were used to compare reach across patient demographic groups to assess treatment disparities and the representativeness of reach. Adoption of the program by hospital services was also assessed. RESULTS Of the 70 hospital services invited to implement the program, 88.6% adopted it and 78.6% had eligible admissions. Treatment reach increased as rates of delivering NRT rose from 43.6% of eligible patients before implementation to 50.4% after implementation (P < 0.0001) and quitline referral rates rose from 0.9% to 11.9% (P < 0.0001). Representativeness of reach by sex and ethnicity improved after implementation, although disparities by race and age persisted after adjustment for demographics, insurance, and primary diagnosis. Pharmacists addressed tobacco use for eligible patients in 62.5% of cases after protocol implementation. CONCLUSION Smoking cessation treatment reach and representativeness of reach improved after implementation of a proactive, pharmacist-led, EHR-facilitated opt-out smoking cessation treatment protocol in adult inpatient services.",1,1,0,0,0,No patient outcomes reported,,,,,,,,,
583,34951623,"A state affiliate's utilization of ASHP's Practice Advancement Initiative 2030 to identify current state of practice and a process to prioritize goal achievement. PURPOSE The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has been a long-standing supporter of advancing pharmacy practice, specifically in the area of pharmacy practice models. In 2019, ASHP began the planning to launch PAI (Practice Advancement Initiative) 2030. PAI 2030 describes and details a bold vision for patient care, medication use, and pharmacy practice over the next decade. This work represents an ambitious goal to continue to advance the profession of pharmacy for the betterment of our patients. While much has been accomplished with the PAI, there is little literature on PAI 2030 (the authors are unaware of any published examples). SUMMARY The purpose of the article is to explain a novel state affiliate's prioritization of ASHP's PAI 2030 recommendations. In the spring of 2020, the North Carolina Association of Pharmacists (NCAP), the North Carolina state affiliate of ASHP, began discussions around PAI 2030. In the fall of 2020, prior to the NCAP Annual Convention, health-system pharmacy leaders within NCAP developed a questionnaire to serve as a PAI 2030 self-assessment. This approach allowed a state affiliate to implement an innovative program to act on the recommendations from PAI 2030. After the prioritization, health-system pharmacy leaders engaged in discussion to comment on what recommendations have been identified. The goal of this discussion was to provide NCAP a direction to pursue focused efforts to support recommendations of PAI 2030. Ultimately, NCAP seeks that this statewide approach would help advance pharmacy practice, and improve pharmacy practice across the state of North Carolina in collaboration with NCAP. CONCLUSION This discussion illustrates how a state affiliate has pursued implementing PAI 2030. This approach provides a strategy for state affiliates in addressing the recommendations within PAI 2030. A novel statewide approach can help marshal resources to advance practice when health systems partner with a state affiliate.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

588,34952654,"Prevalence and risk factors of burnout among Lebanese community pharmacists in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: results from the first national cross-sectional survey. BACKGROUND Community pharmacists (CPs) are increasingly facing occupational challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, putting them at high risk of burnout. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of burnout among Lebanese CPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify its associated factors. METHODS An online survey was conducted among Lebanese CPs between February 1st and March 30, 2021. Collected data included information on sociodemographic characteristics, exposure and work-related variables, the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI), and the COVID-19 threat perception scale. Prevalence of burnout was calculated. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the three burnout domains. RESULTS A total of 387 CPs participated in the survey. Of the total, 53.7% were females; and 43.2% were aged less than 40 years old. The prevalence of moderate-to-high personal, work-related and client-related burnout was 77.8%, 76.8, and 89.7%, respectively. Younger age, staff pharmacist, working more than 40 h per week, high perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with a moderate-to-high likelihood of burnout in all three domains. However, altruistically accepting the risks of caring for COVID-19 patients was the only variable that was associated with a lower likelihood of burnout in all three domains. CONCLUSION An alarming prevalence of personal, work-related and client-related burnout was revealed among Lebanese CPs. This study has many implications for practice and provides a framework for establishing policy interventions to reduce burnout levels among Lebanese CPs. Preventive strategies and interventions on individual and organizational basis are recommended.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
589,34953164,"Experience of pharmacy involvement in a disaster simulation exercise within a pediatric hospital emergency department: A pilot project. PURPOSE In this descriptive report, we describe a unique trial of pharmacist participation in a multidisciplinary pediatric emergency department disaster simulation exercise. With the number of disasters increasing worldwide, the role of pharmacists in disaster response is of particular interest to the profession. SUMMARY This observational study describes pharmacist participation in a disaster simulation exercise. An evaluation tool was developed to assess participants' performance in the following domains: communication, pharmacotherapy, problem solving/decision making, and teamwork/organization. The observers used a rating scale of ""concise/prompt,"" ""needs improvement,"" or ""not done"" to evaluate performance on each objective. The participants' self-perceived knowledge of disaster response was assessed with pre- and postsimulation surveys using Likert scales. Five simulation exercises were held from June to October 2019, with 2 pharmacists participating in each simulation. Within the problem solving/decision making and communication domains, pharmacists were concise/prompt 66% of the time, while they were concise/prompt for 88.8% and 92.5% of tasks in the teamwork/organization and pharmacotherapy domains, respectively. Surveys of self-perceived knowledge revealed that while only 10% of pharmacists felt ""moderately prepared"" prior to the simulation exercise, 80% of pharmacists felt moderately prepared to care for patients during a disaster event after the simulation exercise. CONCLUSION This report describes a unique approach of including emergency department-trained pharmacists in disaster simulation exercises to enhance their professional development, improve team dynamics in a mass casualty scenario, and increase their own reported level of preparedness to effectively manage a surge in critically ill pediatric patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
590,34953510,"Associated Factors and Pharmacists' Role in Medication Adherence and Glycemic Control : A Study in Outpatients With Diabetes at Hue University Hospital, Vietnam.  Objective: To evaluate medication adherence, associated factors, and the role of pharmacists in adherence and outcome treatments in outpatients with diabetes at Hue University Hospital. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a chronic illness that requires daily treatment. Poor adherence to antidiabetic medication can have negative consequences for patients. Data on medication adherence and programs to improve adherence for patients with diabetes in Vietnam are lacking. Methods: A pre-post study was conducted on 354 outpatients diagnosed with T2DM at Hue University Hospital. Participants were interviewed, counseled, and educated by a pharmacist once. The researchers assessed medication adherence levels and glycemic outcomes before and around three months after the intervention. Results: The prevalence of achieving adherence before the intervention was 65.0%. Factors associated with achieving medication adherence were medication regimen (P = 0.001) and controlled glycemic target (P < 0.001). The most common nonadherence behavior was forgetting to take antidiabetic medication. After the intervention, the prevalence of achieving adherence rose to 74.6%, and patients reported that they were more likely to remember to take antidiabetic medications (with statistical significance). The prevalence of achieving the glycemic target (both glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose) rose from 21.8% (before the intervention) to 31.1% (after the intervention). Conclusions: A significant proportion of patients did not achieve medication adherence. Medication adherence is associated with better glycemic outcomes. The role of pharmacists in patient education, medication counseling, and reminding is beneficial in terms of improving adherence levels and glycemic outcomes.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
591,34953730,"Opioid risk screening: Program evaluation from the community pharmacists' perspective. BACKGROUND Pharmacist-implemented screening programs can be improved through continuous program evaluation. Pharmacists are in a position to determine whether interventions are realistic and efficacious when used in practice. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study is to evaluate how community pharmacists perceive the use of an opioid risk screening for patients receiving opioid prescriptions and the associated implications for improved patient-centered care. METHODS North Dakota community pharmacists received training on the use of an opioid risk tool for all patients filling an opioid prescription to evaluate for opioid misuse and overdose risk potential. Pharmacists then implemented the screening in their community pharmacy to screen all patients prescribed an opioid. Six months after implementation, pharmacists across the state were surveyed regarding their perception of the value of screening patients for the risk of opioid misuse and overdose. The survey questions used the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation focusing on utility, propriety, feasibility, and accuracy. RESULTS All pharmacists (n = 35) indicated the opioid risk screening improved patient communication and patient-centered interventions. A total of 97% of pharmacists agreed the opioid screening tool provided an objective measure in providing care to patients and improved the potential for patient safety during prescription opioid use. Although 66% of pharmacists disagreed that the screening process was time consuming, 14% of respondents agreed with this statement indicating they may require additional assistance to optimize their workflow. CONCLUSION The results of this study support that opioid risk screening ensures utility for opioid risk stratification, feasibility to incorporate into existing workflow, and propriety for patient safety and well-being.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

There is evidence of bias against those who wear natural hair styles in job recruitment settings, which can affect how the candidate is perceived. In addition, there have been discriminatory hair policies that affect minoritized people. In the profession of pharmacy, most definitions of professionalism do not comment on physical appearance as a component but focus on characteristics such as knowledge, respect, communication, and empathy. It is critical to ensure that comments about someone's hair are not microaggressions.

593,34954649,"A qualitative study of older adults' facilitators, barriers, and cues to action to engage in falls prevention using health belief model constructs. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Decreasing falls is highly dependent on engagement in fall prevention activities. The Health Belief Model (HBM) theoretical framework was used to explore older adults' perceptions about falls prevention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS An informed grounded theory approach was applied. Four focus groups were conducted using semi-structured interview guides based on the HBM with 27 community-dwelling older adults (average age = 78 years). Deductive content analysis was used to apply constructs of the HBM to the data and explain the findings. RESULTS Potential reasons for not engaging in falls prevention included lack of self-perceived severity, susceptibility, and self-efficacy with a subtheme of lack of information about falls prevention from medical providers. Potential facilitators included older adults' knowledge and current engagement in falls prevention and socializing while engaging in falls prevention. Participants recommended cues to action to improve engagement in falls prevention from family, friends, physicians, pharmacists, and insurance companies; and using various modes to deliver cues to action, including print, audiovisual, online, and reminders. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS In this study, the HBM was used to understand older adults' potential barriers, facilitators, and cues to action to support engagement in falls prevention. Engagement in fall prevention behaviors could be improved by addressing barriers such as lack of knowledge, and lack of self-perceived severity and susceptibility to falls. Reinforcing the benefits of fall prevention, and promoting cues to action to engage in falls prevention may also support engagement.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
594,34955439,"[Opioid agonist therapy and the German Narcotic Drugs Prescription Ordinance from the pharmacist's perspective]. BACKGROUND Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) has been established to be the most important therapy option for improving health and social burdens of people with opioid dependence. Pharmacies provide drug substitutes to substitution practices or outpatient clinics and administer drugs to substituted patients (medication under visual control) or supply prescriptions for unsupervised, at-home use by patients. Given the gaps in medical care, the relevance of pharmacies for the comprehensive treatment of opioid-dependent patients will become even more important in the future. The 3rd Revision of the Narcotic Drugs Prescription Ordinance (NDPO) adopted sweeping reforms to the framework of OAT in 2017. This paper examines the impact of this reform from the pharmacist's perspective. METHODS Between November 2020 and March 2021, pharmacists in the German federal states of Hamburg, North-Rhine Westphalia, Saxony, and Bavaria were informed by their State Chambers of Pharmacists about participation in this online study. A total of 480 questionnaires were evaluated. The analysis differentiates between pharmacists who are currently involved in the substitution of opioid-dependent patients (54.2%), pharmacists who were involved in the past (21.4%), and those who have never been involved in opioid substitution (24.4%). RESULTS Pharmacists involved in OAT have not seen any positive changes resulting from the 3rd Revision of the NDPO. According to 97.9% of the pharmacists, remuneration for administering medication under visual control should be analogous to remuneration in doctors' practices. Mixed prescriptions (prescription of take-home dose and intermediate medication under visual control) increase the administrative workload and are rejected by a quarter of the pharmacists. Non-involved pharmacists significantly overestimated the occurrence of critical situations with substituted patients in the pharmacy. While only 2.7% of pharmacists involved in OAT reported drug emergencies, 23.1% of non-involved pharmacists expressed such concerns. 39.3% of the pharmacists felt they could be motivated to participate in OAT if they were approached directly, and 73.9% of the pharmacists who are currently involved in OAT said they could provide substitution medication under visual control to additional opioid-dependent patients. CONCLUSIONS The 3rd Revision of the NDPO has no influence on the situation and willingness of pharmacists to be involved in OAT. However, to ensure that pharmacists continue to be actively involved in OAT and attract new substituting pharmacies, their importance for comprehensive OAT must be upgraded. This includes, and not least, the funding of pharmacists' administration of substitution drugs under visual control. In addition, knowledge about OAT, attitudes toward opioid-dependent patients, and contact anxiety could be addressed by promoting educational awareness and training.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background In case of emergencies, the number and severity of mass casualties may exceed medical services resources. Saudi Arabia is prone to different disasters, and all medical resources should be ready and prepared to serve during disasters. Pharmacists are essential during disasters; however, their roles have not been well studied during disasters in Saudi Arabia. Methods An observational cross-sectional study targeted tertiary hospitals in Jeddah. An electronic survey, consisting of 34 questions, was developed and distributed to pharmacy directors or their representatives to investigate the hospital pharmacies' preparedness and pharmacist roles during disasters in the city of Jeddah. Results Six hospitals participated in the survey, with a 100% response rate. All respondents confirmed the presence of disaster plans involving pharmacy departments. Hospital committee consensuses determined which medication to stock in five hospitals (83.3%). All six respondents (100%) agreed that the following medication supplies were adequate in the event of disasters: analgesics, rapid sequence intubation medications (ie, sedatives and paralytics), respiratory medications, antimicrobials, and maintenance intravenous (IV) fluids. There was disagreement on the adequacy of wound infection prophylaxis, vasopressors/inotropes, antiemetic medications, ophthalmic medications, and antidotes for chemical weapons. There were discrepancies on pharmacist roles during disaster, but hospitals agreed on the following roles: maintain effective distribution and control, collaborate on medication management, and develop and maintain first-aid skills. Conclusion All included facilities have emergency preparedness plans for the hospitals and the pharmacy departments. However, the type and quantities of stocked medications, as well as pharmacist roles, are not well recognized.

Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of a smoking cessation program (FINE program) in community pharmacies. Methods A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in 11 community pharmacies in Japan. The participants were randomly assigned to a pharmacist-led structured smoking cessation program (intervention group) or pharmacist-led usual care (control group). The intervention group was followed up over the telephone on the third day of smoking cessation, and ongoing follow-up and advice were provided according to the original smoking cessation guidebook developed for the current study based on a behavioral change approach. The control group received brief advice and ready-made pamphlets on smoking cessation from pharmacists upon their visit to these community pharmacies. The primary outcome was continued smoking cessation as determined by self-reporting and carbon monoxide monitoring with a microsmokerlyzer after 3 months. Results Five hundred and seventy-two smokers who met the eligibility criteria visited the pharmacies included in the study. Of these individuals, 24 patients agreed to participate in the study. The quit rates were 45.5% and 18.2% in the intervention and control groups, respectively (P = 0.380, effect size = 0.60). Conclusion Based on the effect size values, the FINE program may be effective to some extent, but the difference was not significant.

BACKGROUND Vancomycin remains the principal antibiotic used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 utilizing hemodialysis (CKD-5D). The recent guidelines have added comprehensive dosing guidance to assist clinicians optimize vancomycin dosing in this population. The purpose of this review was to elaborate on additional practical and stewardship considerations which clinicians may apply in this unique patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS Relevant clinical outcome and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were discussed in this review since the publication of the 2009 version of the vancomycin therapy guidelines. Administering vancomycin during the last 60 - 90 minutes of hemodialysis is preferred to prevent vascular damage and preserve patients' vascular access. RESULTS All published and pertinent data were included across the study period. Two outcome studies, 13 clinical PK studies, and 2 PK modeling studies were identified and discussed in this review. The used loading doses (LD) in the reviewed studies ranged between 18 and 23 mg/kg (~ 1.5 - 2 g) followed by a maintenance dose (MD) of 8 - 13 mg/kg (~ 1 g) administered in the last hour of dialysis (high flux). This dosing strategy resulted in vancomycin pre-dialysis concentrations of ≥ 13 mg/L and favorable clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with bacteremia and skin and soft tissue infections. Regardless of how high the pre-HD vancomycin concentrations were, vancomycin was not associated with favorable outcomes in patients with deep-seated infections. CONCLUSION Vancomycin administration using dialysis access in the last hour of dialysis is suggested. Administering a standard MD would simplify dosing and reduce the risk of errors.

601,34958720,"Perceived risk of opioid use disorder secondary to opioid analgesic medication use by the general population in France. BACKGROUND In Europe and France, the use of opioid analgesic drugs has become widespread as an option for pain management. However, their use can lead to nonmedical use and/or opioid use disorder (OUD). This work aimed to assess the perceived risk of OUD secondary to opioid analgesic drugs use by the general population. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using the GrippeNet web-based cohort, comprising about 10,000 French volunteers from the general population, using a self-administered questionnaire. The main outcome was the perceived risk of OUD secondary to opioid analgesic drugs use, assessed by a 4-item scale and modeled using logistic regression (backward procedure). RESULTS Among 5,046 French respondents, after adjustment, 65% believed that the use of analgesic drugs could likely or very likely lead to OUD. Factors associated with perception of a higher risk were being over 50 and having heard about opioids in the media. Previous opioid use and a high level of education decreased the perception of the risk. Among those having used opioids in the past two years (N = 1770), 71.1% reported being not at all concerned by this risk. The majority of the sample perceived the risk of OUD but those having already used opioid analgesics drugs expressed no concern about this risk for themselves. CONCLUSIONS This finding highlight the need to reinforce warning on the package insert documents, therapeutic education and collaborative care between the prescribing general practitioners and pharmacists to increase awareness of opioid medications users on the risk of OUD.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we investigate how pharmacy roles (i.e., pharmacy technicians, pharmacists, and PharmD students) and pharmacy context (i.e., independent community, retail chain, and hospital care) affect feelings about work. Following research on status shields at work and the job characteristics model, we pose hypotheses about meaning in work, impact at work, as well as job satisfaction, and intent to quit. This study uses a conceptualization of status shields as both part of the pharmacy hierarchy and associated with work contexts.

Discrepancies between the medicines consumed by patients and those documented in the medical record can affect medication safety. We aimed to characterize medication discrepancies and medication regimen complexity over time in a cohort of outpatients with decompensated cirrhosis, and evaluate the impact of pharmacist-led intervention on discrepancies and patient outcomes. In a randomized-controlled trial (n = 57 intervention and n = 57 usual care participants), medication reconciliation and patient-oriented education delivered over a six-month period was associated with a 45% reduction in the incidence rate of 'high' risk discrepancies (IRR = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.31-0.96) compared to usual care. For each additional 'high' risk discrepancy at baseline, the odds of having ≥ 1 unplanned medication-related admission during a 12-month follow-up period increased by 25% (adj-OR = 1.25, 95%CI = 0.97-1.63) independently of the Child-Pugh score and a history of variceal bleeding. Among participants with complete follow-up, intervention patients were 3-fold less likely to have an unplanned medication-related admission (adj-OR = 0.27, 95%CI = 0.07-0.97) compared to usual care. There was no association between medication discrepancies and mortality. Medication regimen complexity, frequent changes to the regimen and hepatic encephalopathy were associated with discrepancies.

604,34961548,"National pharmacy associations in the commonwealth: current scenario and future needs to maximise effective contributions of the pharmacy profession towards universal health coverage. BACKGROUND The Commonwealth Pharmacists Association (CPA) is a charity representing pharmacists across the Commonwealth, with the vision of empowering and collaboratively develop the profession and fully utilise the potential of pharmacists to strengthen health systems through supporting better access to, quality and use of medicines and related services. Commonwealth comprises predominantly of low- and middle-income countries, where limited data often exists in pharmacy practice. There is a recognised need across the Commonwealth to focus on developing, implementing and fully utilising pharmacy professional services to progress universal health coverage and achieve the sustainable development goals, particularly in low and middle-income countries; however, currently a knowledge gap exists in understanding the national priorities in Commonwealth nations. CPA is ideally positioned to access to these nations. The aim of this study was thus to explore the priorities and focus areas of NPAs across the Commonwealth and create evidence for a needs-based approach to inform the support that the Commonwealth pharmacists association can collaboratively and strategically provide to its members to progress towards shared goals. METHODS Data were collected virtually on Zoom by conducting interviews using a semi-structured interview guide developed for this study with CPA councillors representing NPAs or their equivalents if no official body existed. An inductive, reflexive, thematic analysis was performed for data analysis. RESULTS In total, 30 councillors were interviewed from 30 low- and medium-income countries. The three main overarching priority areas identified across respective Commonwealth nations developing extended pharmacy services, improving pharmacy education, and developing and redefining the role of NPAs. CONCLUSIONS This novel study highlights the collective priorities for the pharmacy profession across the low and middle-income countries of the Commonwealth and the urgent need for supporting NPAs around the three identified overarching priority areas. The mapped-out priorities will inform an evidence-based approach for the CPA to better support NPAs in their mission through advocacy and practitioner development, to fully harness pharmacists' unique skill set and maximise their contribution to progressing universal health coverage.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
605,34961807,"Shedding the Light on Pharmacists' Roles during COVID-19 Global Pandemic. Introduction (Background)The role of pharmacists revolves around providing the highest levels of care to society and ensuring the provision of medicine to all patients. However, with the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), pharmacists as a very important part of healthcare professionals' team are responsible for fighting against the disease regardless of their setting of practice. The role of pharmacists will undergo a little change to extend and include other roles in order to ensure the safety of the community and limit the virus spread. Also, they will be required to obtain information from reliable sources, and to be up to date, so they can be reliable advisors to the community and raise their awareness. Objectives The purpose of this review is to highlight community and hospital pharmacists' roles during (COVID-19) global pandemic, and to clearly illustrate how they are contributing to maintain pharmacy services continuity, supporting other healthcare professionals, and facilitating the patient's education. Summary Clinical pharmacists provide direct patient care through monitoring adverse drug reactions, ensuring individualized treatment, performing evidence-based practice, and evaluating drugs in clinical trials. On the other hand, community pharmacists which are the most accessible healthcare providers by the community increase their awareness regarding the preventive measures, balance medicines supply and demand, provide drive-thru and home delivery services, offer telehealth counselling, psychological support, refer suspected COVID-19 patients, and provide vaccination when available. Conclusion Innovative pharmacists' roles have emerged to adapt to changes during COVID-19 pandemic, however, they may be needed in the post COVID-19 world as well.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND School based asthma care is being increasingly used to combat uncontrolled pediatric asthma. OBJECTIVE The purpose of these secondary analyses was to explore multi-level perspectives regarding school-based asthma medical management for inner city, school-aged children with poor asthma control. METHODS Sixty-six participants from two large U.S. urban school districts and key stakeholders participated in 1:1 interviews and focus groups. Participants were selected from across the asthma care community (children/caregivers, school personnel, nurses, pharmacists, healthcare providers, and administrators/insurers). Qualitative and descriptive techniques were used to analyze data. RESULTS Goals: Children/caregivers prioritized living a normal active life with few asthma worries. Other stakeholders prioritized reducing student's asthma related emergency room visits and lost learning time. Facilitators: Continuity of care, strong relationships between care community members, and incentivizers were commonly suggested facilitators. School-based asthma management was viewed as a strong facilitator, particularly in the presence of a full-time school nurse. Barriers: Four themes were identified. (1) Greater systems and policy support for asthma management is needed in general, and at school in particular. (2) Overburdened families and systems often operate in crisis-mode, and asthma management is often not a priority until crisis is reached. (3) Discordance and distrust between members of the asthma care community can hinder shared asthma management. (4) Better communication is needed at all levels to improve care. CONCLUSION Moving away from a crisis-based approach to asthma management for high-risk children will require increased systemic support for proactive asthma care and optimized communication within the asthma care community.

BACKGROUND Transitions of care (ToC) aim to provide continuity while preventing loss of information that may result in poor outcomes such as hospital readmission. Readmissions not only burden patients, they also increase costs. Given the high prevalence of coronary artery diseases (CAD) in the United States (US), patients with CAD often make up a significant portion of hospital readmissions. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review evaluating the impact of pharmacist-driven ToC interventions on post-hospital outcomes for patients with CAD. METHODS MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched from database inception through 03/2020 using key words for CAD and pharmacists. Studies were included if they: (1) identified adults with CAD at US hospitals, (2) evaluated pharmacist-driven ToC interventions, and (3) assessed post-discharge outcomes. Outcomes were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS Of the 1612 citations identified, 11 met criteria for inclusion. Pharmacist-driven ToC interventions were multifaceted and frequently included medication reconciliation, medication counseling, post-discharge follow-up and initiatives to improve medication adherence. Hospital readmission and emergency room visits were numerically lower among patients receiving vs not receiving pharmacist-driven interventions, with statistically significant differences observed in 1 study. Secondary prevention measures and adherence tended to be more favorable in the pharmacist-driven intervention groups. CONCLUSION Eleven studies of multifaceted, ToC interventions led by pharmacists were identified. Readmissions were numerically lower and secondary prevention measures and adherence were more favorable among patients receiving pharmacist-driven interventions.

BACKGROUND Hospital to community pharmacy transfer of care medicines-related interventions for inpatients discharged home aim to improve continuity of care and patient outcomes. One such intervention has been provided for seven years within a region in England. This study reports upon the implementation process and fidelity of this intervention. METHODS The process evaluation guidance issued by the Medical Research Council has informed this study. A logic model to describe the intervention and causal assumptions was developed from preliminary semi-structured interviews with project team members. Further semi-structured interviews were undertaken with intervention providers from hospital and community pharmacy, and with patient and public representatives. These aimed to investigate intervention implementation process and fidelity. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Consolidated Framework for Intervention Fidelity informed interview topic guides and underpinned the thematic framework analysis using a combined inductive and deductive approach. RESULTS Themes provided information about intervention fidelity and implementation that were mapped across the sub processes of implementation: planning, execution, reflection and evaluation, and engagement. Interviewees described factors such as lack of training, awareness, clarity on the service specification, governance and monitoring and information and feedback which caused significant issues with the process of intervention implementation and suboptimal intervention fidelity. CONCLUSIONS This provides in-depth insight into the implementation process and fidelity of a ToC intervention, and the extant barriers and facilitators. The findings offer learning to inform the design and implementation of similar interventions, contribute to the evidence base about barriers and facilitators to such interventions and provides in-depth description of the implementation and mechanisms of impact which have the potential to influence clinical and economic outcome evaluation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
609,34963352,"Methods and Barriers to Communication Between Pharmacists During Transitions of Care. BACKGROUND Effective communication between pharmacists across healthcare settings is essential to facilitate transitions of care (TOC) and improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE To explore pharmacists' communication methods and preferences and identify barriers to communication during TOC. METHODS A survey was distributed to a convenience sample of pharmacists in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Texas. The survey collected information on pharmacists' demographics, practice settings, and clinical services, and their methods, preferences, and barriers to communication during TOC. RESULTS A total of 308 responses were included in the analysis. The majority of pharmacists practiced in inpatient pharmacy (39.3%) followed by outpatient community pharmacy (23.4%). About 57.8% of pharmacists reported involvement in TOC services. Among respondents, most reported electronic health record (EHR) as their primary method of communication to receive (66.2%) and send (55.5%) information to perform TOC services. Additionally, EHR was reported as the preferred method of communication to receive (75.4%) and send (75.5%) information during TOC. The primary reasons pharmacists reported not utilizing patient health information were lack of information (38.4%), incorrect information (36.7%), delay in receiving information (36.7%), and lack of time (34.5%). Barriers to providing TOC services included poor communication during handoffs (44.2%) and difficulty obtaining needed patient medical information (43.9%). CONCLUSION This study identified methods and barriers to communication between pharmacists during TOC across healthcare settings. This provides an opportunity for future research to develop interventions to improve communication between pharmacists at different practice settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
610,34965060,"Diabetes Mellitus in People with Cancer  There is increasing evidence of an association between cancer and diabetes mellitus. Patients with type II diabetes are at increased risk of malignancy due to shared risk factors between the two conditions, and people with a diagnosis of cancer may develop new onset diabetes or impaired glycemic control, partly as a result of the systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT) they receive. Many newer targeted anti-cancer treatments can have off-target metabolic toxicities not seen with conventional chemotherapy agents. Early recognition of diabetes or hyperglycemia in people with cancer can improve outcomes. This chapter aims to summarize these associations, provide an overview of how different SACT modalities can impact on glycemic control, and highlight key recommendations for the management of this complex patient group.

611,34965894,"Use of professional practice guidance resources in pharmacy: a cross-sectional nationwide survey of pharmacists, intern pharmacists, and pharmacy students. BACKGROUND Variations in practice are commonplace in healthcare where health professionals, such as pharmacists act as autonomous practitioners. This is evident in simulated patient studies, where pharmacists practice does not meet widely accepted standards for medicines supply or treatment of an ailment. To promote best pharmacy practice a myriad of guidance resources including practice guidelines, codes and standards are produced by professional organisations. These resources provide a framework for pharmacy practice and endeavour to facilitate consistency in provision of pharmacy-based services to consumers. Despite their role in specifying essential pharmacist behaviours, there is limited research exploring if and how these resources are used in practice. OBJECTIVE To characterise Australian pharmacists' use of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia's Code of Ethics, Professional Practice Guidelines and Professional Practice Standards. METHODS A cross-sectional, self-administered, electronic survey of registered pharmacists, intern pharmacists and pharmacy students living in Australia was conducted in July 2020. Questions considered use of professional practice resources (by resource group) in the preceding 12 months. Data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS Of 601 responses included in the analysis 462 (76.9%) of respondents were registered pharmacists, 88 (14.6%) pharmacy students and 51 (8.5%) intern pharmacists. Interns and students accessed overarching practice resources, such as the Professional Practice Standards, Code of Ethics and Dispensing Practice Guidelines more frequently than practising pharmacists. Pharmacists accessed professional practice guidelines, such as Practice Guidelines for the Provision of Immunisation Services Within Pharmacy, more often than students. More pharmacists than interns and students indicated that they would access guidelines to resolve practice and patient care issues. All resources except the Professional Practice Standards for Pharmacists (67.4%) were accessed by less than 50% of respondents in the preceding 12-month period. Reasons for not accessing resources varied between participant and resource groups, and generally were due to a lack of awareness of the resource or not considering them necessary for the individual's practice. CONCLUSION(S) Access and use patterns for professional practice guidance resources change with experience. Professional organisations responsible for developing resources should consider these patterns when designing and reviewing resources and related policies. To ensure resources are meeting the needs of the profession, students, interns, and pharmacists should be involved in the review of and design of further resources.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Using electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has become a stepping stone for smokers in their cessation of tobacco use. Students within Doctor of Pharmacy and other health care programs have expressed varying responses as to how likely they are to recommend ENDS based on their knowledge of these devices. Because the amount of education on these products provided by PharmD programs varies, one study shows student pharmacists were less likely to recommend the use of ENDS to current cigarette smokers.

613,34965913,"The Myth of Multitasking and What It Means for Future Pharmacists.  Objective The primary purposes of this study were to determine the extent to which multitasking affects the speed and accuracy with which Doctor of Pharmacy students identify prescription errors and whether there is a relationship between students' self-perception of their multitasking ability and their actual ability.Methods One hundred twenty-one second-year pharmacy students enrolled in the required course Introduction to Dosage Forms spent one week in an experimental (multitasking) condition and one week in a control (undistracted) condition. Subjects were given 10 minutes to check 10 prescriptions and record any identified filling errors. A cellular phone was placed in each room. Subjects in the experimental (multitasking) condition answered a call from a researcher posing as a talkative customer during the prescription-checking task while subjects in the control condition were not interrupted by a cell phone call during the task. Subjects' completion times and accuracy were recorded.Results When subjects were multitasking, they took significantly longer to complete the prescription-checking task than when they were not multitasking. Furthermore, when subjects were multitasking, they scored significantly lower on the prescription-checking task than when they were not multitasking. Finally, students' self-perceptions of their multitasking abilities were not related to the speed with which they completed the prescription-checking task nor to their accuracy.Conclusion Multitasking negatively affects speed and accuracy of prescription verification in student pharmacists. Our procedure can be used as an in-class activity to demonstrate the limits of attention and to shape how future pharmacists practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

615,34965915,"Teaching Intellectual Humility Is Essential in Preparing Collaborative Future Pharmacists.  Interprofessional teams contribute significantly to patient care and safety. However, barriers to effective interdisciplinary collaboration have been identified, such as power dynamics and mistrust among team members, contrasting ideologies, interests and levels of engagement of clinicians, and disciplinary territoriality, which could negatively impact patient care. Teaching current health professional students behaviors and personal values that promote collaboration is critical in equipping them to function effectively in an interdisciplinary care setting. In this commentary, we put forward the idea that teaching intellectual humility is important in preparing collaborative future pharmacists. The core dimensions of intellectual humility, namely, open-mindedness, intellectual modesty, engagement, and corrigibility are important behaviors that could address the above-mentioned barriers, and promote successful interdisciplinary collaboration. Furthermore, we suggest strategies through which student pharmacists could be taught intellectual humility, mainly within the interprofessional education setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
616,34965916,"General Anxiety, Academic Distress, and Family Distress Among Doctor of Pharmacy Students.  Objective. To examine the prevalence of general anxiety among Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students and the role of academic distress and family distress in causing general anxiety.Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among first, second, and third year PharmD students. All students received an online survey consisting of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-62 (CCAPS-62) questionnaire and sample characteristics. Variables from CCAPS-62 considered in this study included academic distress and family distress measured on a three-level scale: no, low, and high clinical level. Data on gender, race, work status, and physical activity were also collected. Descriptive and multinomial logistic regression were conducted to identify factors associated with general anxiety.Results. Of the 238 students who took the online survey (63% response rate), the majority were female (67%) and Asian (49%). Overall, 69 first year, 75 second year, and 94 third year students participated. The prevalence of general anxiety was 50%, with equal distribution (25% each) among high-clinical and low-clinical general anxiety groups. High academic distress and high family distress were associated with a greater probability of a student having high general anxiety.Conclusion. General anxiety was quite prevalent among pharmacy students. Identification and implementation of strategies to lower general anxiety as well as academic distress is of great importance. Also, understanding and enhancing the role of family members in students' lives is essential.

Studies have examined possible predictors of success on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX). This systematic review investigated the literature on potential predictors of success on the NAPLEX.Findings. Articles were included in the review if they studied student characteristics and academic performance as independent variables and NAPLEX scores and/or pass rates as an outcome. Data were extracted from each article for students' demographics or variables, sample size, methods of statistical analyses, and results reporting correlation or predictability. From 40 articles retrieved from the initial search and sorting, 20 studies were included in the final review per inclusion criteria. Three studies included all the pharmacy programs, 15 were single-institution studies, two were multi-institution studies, and four had been published as posters. Among 30 different variables identified as potential predictors of success on the NAPLEX, the most examined variables were student age at matriculation, having a prior degree, Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) scores, cumulative pharmacy school grade point average (GPA), overall Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA) scores, and PCOA content areas scores. Positively correlated factors included PCAT scores, not having a prior degree, prepharmacy and pharmacy school GPA, institutional characteristics, and PCOA scores.

618,34967010,"Not your usual drug-drug interactions: Monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics may interact with antiseizure medications.  Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as the fastest growing drug class. As such, mAbs are increasingly being co-prescribed with other drugs, including antiseizure medications (ASMs). Although mAbs do not share direct targets or mechanisms of disposition with small-molecule drugs (SMDs), combining therapeutics of both types can increase the risk of adverse effects and treatment failure. The primary goal of this literature review was identifying mAb-ASM combinations requiring the attention of professionals who are treating patients with epilepsy. Systematic PubMed and Embase searches (1980-2021) were performed for terms relating to mAbs, ASMs, drug interactions, and their combinations. Additional information was obtained from documents from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Evidence was critically appraised - key issues calling for clinicians' consideration and important knowledge gaps were identified, and practice recommendations were developed by a group of pharmacists and epileptologists. The majority of interactions were attributed to the indirect effects of cytokine-modulating antibodies on drug metabolism. Conversely, strong inhibitors or inducers of drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters could potentially interact with the cytotoxic payload of antibody-drug conjugates, and ASMs could alter mAb biodistribution. In addition, mAbs could potentiate adverse ASM effects. Unfortunately, few studies involved ASMs, requiring the formulation of class-based recommendations. Based on the current literature, most mAb-ASM interactions do not warrant special precautions. However, specific combinations should preferably be avoided, whereas others require monitoring and potentially adjustment of the ASM doses. Reduced drug efficacy or adverse effects could manifest days to weeks after mAb treatment onset or discontinuation, complicating the implication of drug interactions in potentially deleterious outcomes. Prescribers who treat patients with epilepsy should be familiar with mAb pharmacology to better anticipate potential mAb-ASM interactions and avoid toxicity, loss of seizure control, or impaired efficacy of mAb treatment.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

ABSTRACT This study aimed to assess the impact of the pharmacist-led intervention on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis by standardizing the cephalosporin intradermal skin test in the orthopedic department.A pre-and postintervention study was conducted among patients in the Orthopedics Department at the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital in China. Use of intradermal skin test, perioperative antibacterial prophylaxis, and cost of care were compared between the preintervention population (admitted from 6/1/2018 to 8/31/2018) and postintervention population (admitted from 1/1/2019 to 3/31/2019). Logistic regression and generalized linear regression were used to assess the intervention impact.425 patients from the preintervention period and 448 patients from the postintervention period were included in the study. After the implementation of the pharmacist intervention program, there was a decrease in the utilization of intradermal skin tests, from 95.8% to 16.5% (P < .001). Patients were more likely to have cephalosporin as prophylactic antimicrobials (OR = 5.28, P < .001) after the implementation. The cost of antimicrobials was significantly reduced by $150.21 (P < .001) for each patient.Pharmacist-involved intervention can reduce the utilization of cephalosporins skin tests and decrease the prescription of unnecessary high-cost antimicrobials.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,

Many studies analyze the medication errors in the hospital setting, but the literature involving the home care setting seems scarce. The aim of this study is to identify the main risk factors that affect the genesis of medication errors and the possible solutions to reduce the phenomenon in the home care setting. This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The critical analysis of the literature shows that medication errors in home care occur mainly during transitional care. The main risk factors related to transitional care are poor interprofessional communication, lack of a standardized process for medication reconciliation, the widespread use of computerized tools, and the inadequate integration of the pharmacist into the care team. The strategies to reduce the risk of errors from therapy at home are the implementation of the pharmacist in the health team to ensure accurate medication reconciliation and the use of computerized tools to improve communication between professionals and to reduce the dispersion of information.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
621,34967466,"Use of Hormonal Contraceptives in Perimenopause: A Systematic Review. INTRODUCTION Hormonal contraceptives have been used in perimenopausal women to manage a variety of symptoms and prevent unintended pregnancy. However, it is unclear what contraceptive regimen is best for these women. OBJECTIVE To evaluate hormonal contraceptive methods in women experiencing perimenopause using two prespecified outcomes: perimenopausal symptom management and long-term effects. METHODS A literature search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed (January 1990 to October 2021) using search terms ""perimenopause"" and ""contraception."" Relevant full-text articles in English were included. RESULTS Fifteen clinical articles were reviewed. Fourteen were internationally-based and one study was conducted in the United States. Nine articles evaluated symptom resolution, and six of these nine reported statistically significant changes in favor of treating perimenopausal women with hormonal contraceptives compared with no treatment. Seven studies evaluated long-term outcomes including bone loss and metabolic parameters, and six of these seven showed statistically significant improvements with hormonal contraceptives. Based on limited data and a lack of comparative studies, the use of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device with supplemental low-dose menopausal estrogen has positive results for the management of disruptive perimenopausal symptoms and long-term outcomes. CONCLUSION Hormonal contraception in perimenopausal women improves symptom management and long-term outcomes if patients do not have contraindications.

In response to the social goal of ""carbon peak and carbon neutral"" in the 14th Five-Year Plan of China, this article used Enrofloxacin (ENR), a common antibiotic, as a model compound to study the method of efficiently degrading pharmaceutical sludge and simultaneously producing Formic Acid (FA), hydrogen storage energy, in a sub-supercritical system. The Ni/SnO2 bimetallic catalyst, which was prepared by the equal volume impregnation method, was used for the liquid phase catalysis. As shown by the results, when the reaction temperature was 330 ℃, and the addition amount of H2O2 was 0.38 mL, the degradation rate of antibiotics could reach 99% after the reaction proceeded for 6 hours. In terms of the resource utilization, the yield of FA could reach up to 32.44%. The resource utilization efficiency with Ni/SnO2 catalyst in sub-/supercritical reaction was about 2.5 times higher than that without catalyst. The kinetic reaction model was established to explore the reaction rate of the antibiotic degradation process. In addition, the Ea and the frequency factor of the reaction were 6455 J/mol and 5.78, respectively. As shown by characterization, the prepared Ni/SnO2 bimetallic catalyst had good activity and has already passed repeated stability experiments.

OBJECTIVES To assess and compare the pharmaceutical analysis on drug management in a geriatric acute care unit prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This was a single-centre, retrospective, and comparative cohort study. All Pharmacist Interventions (PIs) carried out in the unit between 27 January 2020 and 30 April 2020 were distinguished according to whether they were conducted prior to or during the first wave of COVID-19. The main outcome measure was the rate of PIs per patient and per prescription lines analysed. Other data collected were the drug class managed by the PI, the Drug Related Problems (DRP) identified, the nature of the advice given, and the acceptance rate by geriatricians. RESULTS A total of 355 patients were analysed, with PIs generated for 21.7% of the patients prior to COVID-19, and for 53.4% of the patients during the first wave (p<0.001). Among the 4,402 prescription lines analysed, 54 PIs were carried out for prescriptions prior to COVID-19, and 177 during the first wave (p=0.002). DRPs were mostly related to anti-infectious drugs during the pandemic (20.3%, p=0.038), and laxatives prior to the pandemic (13.0%, p=0.023).

OBJECTIVES Polymedication and medication hoarding in patients' homes may increase the risk of drug-related problems (DRPs). Community pharmacists can prevent DRPs through medication reconciliation and review. This study aims to (1) develop a tool for community pharmacists to perform domiciliary medication review (ReMeDo) and (2) assess the interrater and test-retest reliability and acceptability of the tool. METHODS The ReMeDo tool was first developed 6 years before this study to perform medication review during pharmacist home visits. A literature review was performed to update the content of the existing tool. Ten pharmacy students participated in the assessment of the interrater and test-retest reliability using three vignettes based on former ReMeDo patients. Test-retest reliability coefficients were calculated for the entire tool and each segment. Global and individual interrater reliability coefficients were also computed. Acceptability was assessed through a satisfaction survey. KEY FINDINGS The ReMeDo tool was structured to guide the collection of information before, during and after the pharmacist home visit. The global kappa coefficients for interrater and test-retest reliability were 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.67 to 0.73) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.74), respectively. The test-retest reliability coefficients for each segment and the interrater reliability coefficients for participants were higher than 0.60 (except for one participant), demonstrating a moderate to substantial level of agreement.

Background Academic detailing (AD) is a tailored, interactive educational outreach intervention that may improve patient outcomes. Insight into the design of AD interventions and the extent to which they are effective can help inform future AD-based programmes. The objective of this scoping review was to characterize opioid-focused AD interventions and describe their findings. Methods A scoping review focused on AD interventions for opioids was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL databases through July 1, 2021. Studies were eligible for inclusion if written in English, included interactive opioid-focused educational interventions, and were conducted either in person, virtually or via telephone. Four independent reviewers reviewed titles and abstracts. Data extraction from full-text publications was completed using a standardized form. Results Of 6086 articles initially identified, 22 articles met the inclusion criteria and 20 unique interventions were identified. The AD intervention was either delivered one-on-one (n=16) or in a small, interactive group setting (n=4). AD interventions varied in design. Effectiveness was evaluated in terms of opioid and naloxone prescribing rates, provider knowledge gaps, provider adherence to guidelines, and intervention feasibility. Sixteen (80%) interventions resulted in statistically significant improvement in one or more outcomes. Conclusion Generally, opioid-related AD was effective and programmes were primarily conducted one-on-one between pharmacists and primary care providers for 16-30 minutes. A variety of metrics and outcomes were used to assess the success/effectiveness of AD interventions, which is an important consideration in future studies as no single metric captures the effectiveness of an educational outreach-based intervention for pain management.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding the prescribing of opioids and addiction in a dental school population. METHODS Predoctoral dental students, residents, and dental faculty were surveyed about their beliefs, awareness, opinions about, and prior training in the prescribing of opioids, current prescribing practices, and confidence with risk mitigation strategies. Demographic information collected included gender, race/ethnicity, faculty/student role, year of birth, and year of graduation. RESULTS Responses were received from 220 faculty and students (n = 47 and n = 173, respectively). Both faculty and students agreed that opioids were overprescribed for the treatment of dental pain. A majority of faculty and dental students (DS)3 + DS4 and DS1 + DS2 students expressed no or limited prior training in (1) the approved state opioid guidelines (75%, 79%, and 95%, respectively), (2) the identification/assessment of substance use disorders (68%, 81%, and 92%, respectively), and (3) patient education to accompany the prescribing of opioids (71%, 80%, and 92%, respectively). A majority of faculty reported moderate or extreme confidence in their clinical skills related to the prescribing of opioids (75%), their ability to identify patients with substance use disorders (55%), and their ability to discuss addiction risk and secure storage of opioids (65%). In contrast, DS3 + DS4 and DS1 + DS2 students expressed significantly less confidence and training. Faculty and students agreed that the role of a dentist included risk mitigation, but reported actions did not match their beliefs, reportedly due to lack of time, less confidence, and the assumption that a pharmacist would assume risk mitigation conversations.

BACKGROUND One of the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health system has been increasing the burden on the patients with dementia and their families. Telemedicine has shown to be a solution for this vulnerable group and can be used for cognitive assessment, medication adjustment, patient referral, reduces the travel time, cost and caregiver burden. Despite the challenges in acceptance for this novel technology in the elderly 1, it can reduce the burden of disease and increase access to specialised services. All these alongside neurologic visit could be provided with a telephone hotline or preferably video-platform tele-visit.2 However, barriers to develop telemedicine include a lack of broadband internet access and the need for insurance coverage.3 The American Academy of Neurology has been developed a comprehensive guideline to implement the tele-visit approach in the COVID-19 crisis with a special approach to neurological examination limitations in the patients.4 Numerous studies evaluated this approach to assess patients including dementia.5 Overall, the patients, caregivers, and the neurologists reported a high satisfaction rate.6 Yaadmaan Institution for Brain, Cognition and Memory Studies with a multidisciplinary team including cognitive neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, geriatrician, and clinical pharmacist is the first private referral center for cognitive disorders in Iran. After starting quarantine and tight restrictions and because of too many families who were seeking help for their patients via Yaadmaan helpline, we decided to start Telemedicine method. The approach and compatible examinations have been shown in Table 2 and 3 respectively. In addition, we defined a list of serious states to avoid Telemedicine for patients referal to the hospital in Table 4. Based on our one-year experiences, it seems there are promising results in-terms of feasibility, acceptability and convenience for the patient, caregiver and physician. However, due to the emergence of this pandemic, Telemedicine and its crucial role in Iran has not yet been identified in the insurance and health system appropriately.

628,34971408,"Pharmaceutical Interventions on Hospital Discharge Prescriptions: Prospective Observational Study Highlighting Challenges for Community Pharmacists. BACKGROUND Transition between hospital and ambulatory care is a delicate step involving several healthcare professionals and presenting a considerable risk of drug-related problems. OBJECTIVE To investigate pharmaceutical interventions made on hospital discharge prescriptions by community pharmacists. METHOD This observational, prospective study took place in 14 community pharmacies around a Swiss acute care hospital. We recruited patients with discharge prescriptions (minimum three drugs) from the internal medicine ward of the hospital. The main outcome measures were: number and type of pharmaceutical interventions made by community pharmacists, time spent on discharge prescriptions, number of medication changes during the transition of care. RESULTS The study included 64 patients discharged from the hospital. Community pharmacists made a total of 439 interventions; a mean of 6.9 ± 3.5 (range 1-16) interventions per patient. All of the discharge prescriptions required pharmaceutical intervention, and 61 (95%) necessitated a telephone call to the patients' hospital physician for clarifications. The most frequent interventions were: confirming voluntary omission of a drug (31.7%), treatment substitution (20.5%), dose adjustment (16.9%), and substitution for reimbursement issues (8.8%). Roughly half (52%) of all discharge prescriptions required 10-20 min for pharmaceutical validation. The mean number of medication changes per patient was 16.4: 9.6 changes between hospital admission and discharge, 2.6 between hospital discharge and community pharmacy, and 4.2 between community pharmacy and a general practitioner's appointment.

The prevalences of ADE-Ps and potential ADEs were 9.2% (95% CI 7.5-11.3) and 5.0% (95% CI 3.8-6.6), respectively. The severity of harm was classified as 'death or likely permanent harm' in 4.7% (95% CI 0.2-9.1) of ADE-Ps, 'temporary harm' (89.5%, 95% CI 83.1-96.0) and 'minimal or no harm' (5.8%, 95% CI 0.9-10.8). Most (79.1%, 95% CI 70.5-87.7) ADE-Ps were preventable. CONCLUSIONS There is a high burden on emergency care because of unintended medication harm in the community. Interventions to reduce such harm are likely to require a co-ordinated primary, acute and public healthcare response. The high proportion of presentations with potential ADEs indicates opportunity for harm mitigation in the ED.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
631,34975006,"Assessing the impact of adding pharmacist management services to an existing discharge planning program on 30-day readmissions. BACKGROUND Although hospital readmission rates are declining nationally, avoidable readmissions remain a public health concern. Effective readmission interventions are multifaceted and include discharge planning and transition-of-care coordination. Clinical pharmacists are effective contributors to these processes, bringing expertise to discharge counseling, medication reconciliation, medication adherence, and postdischarge follow-up counseling. OBJECTIVE We evaluated the impact of adding health plan clinical pharmacy management services to an existing discharge program on all-cause readmissions and postdischarge primary physician visits. METHOD Pharmacy management services by health plan clinical pharmacists of a large regional integrated delivery system were added to an existing optimal discharge planning (ODP) program. Criteria for eligibility for these pharmacists' services included patients who prescribed a new maintenance medication after discharge, received a therapeutic substitution, had a previous discharge within 30 days, or were taking a high-risk medication. A retrospective, observational analysis of a subgroup of patients, who received the pharmacy management services as part of ODP, was performed using a difference-in-difference model, by comparing propensity-matched discharges from February 22, 2016, to January 31, 2017 (preprogram implementation) with discharges from February 22, 2017, to January 31, 2018 (implementation period), to estimate changes in 30-day readmission rates and postdischarge primary physician visits. RESULTS A total of 111 of the propensity matched received the pharmacy management services; of these, 73% (ODP) versus 64% (non-ODP) were ≥ 58 years, 60% were females, and 62% (ODP) versus 52% (non-ODP) were Medicare beneficiaries. There was a 16.7% (P = 0.022) statistically significant reduction in combined inpatient and observation 30-day readmissions and a 19.7% increase in 5-day postdischarge follow-up physician visits (P = 0.037) for the subgroup who also received the pharmacy management services. CONCLUSION Addition of pharmacist management services to an existing hospital discharge program for select at-risk patients was associated with reduced inpatient and observation 30-day readmissions.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Inpatient,
632,34975592,"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia: A Year Later Into the Pandemic.  Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to healthcare workers worldwide. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia, and to identify the factors associated with these psychological disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted from January 21 to March 2, 2021. Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare workers from different parts of Saudi Arabia were recruited through snowball sampling. Psychological outcomes were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pearson's chi-square test was used to explore the bivariate association between diverse characteristics and each outcome. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: A total of 501 healthcare workers completed the survey, of whom 60% were female and nearly half were pharmacists. The majority (76.25%) of respondents reported that a family member, friend, or colleague had contracted COVID-19, and more than one-third (36%) knew someone who died due to COVID-19. Overall, the estimated prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 54.69, 60.88, and 41.92%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that healthcare workers with chronic diseases, nurses, and healthcare workers from the southern region were more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Further, individuals with positive COVID-19 test results showed a greater proportion of depressive symptoms compared to others. In addition, knowing someone who died due to COVID-19 and having a chronic illness were predisposing factors for anxiety. Conclusion: After more than a year, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remains substantial among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. The findings can help guide efforts to mitigate the psychological impact of the pandemic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
633,34976448,"COVID-19: Risk Stratification of Healthcare Workers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and Their Knowledge, Attitude, and Fears.  Introduction With the expeditious spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), healthcare workers have undoubtedly faced a higher risk of contracting the disease compared to the general public. This study aimed to stratify the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 infection among healthcare workers in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia and shed light on their level of knowledge, attitude, and fear towards the disease. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study, involving 978 Arabic and English-speaking healthcare workers, was conducted using a self-administered online questionnaire. The knowledge, attitude, and fear scales were developed by researchers using the most updated information regarding coronavirus disease 2019. The Objective Risk Stratification tool developed in the United Kingdom was used to measure the risk level of contracting coronavirus disease 2019. Collected data were analyzed and interpreted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. Results Out of the 978 participants, 63.1% were female, 74.6% were 20-39 years old, 86.9% were Saudis, and 31.3% worked as physicians. The most common health-related risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 among the study participants were smoking (23.4%), sickle cell trait (22.8%), and asthma (21.2%). The risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 was found to be low in 87.2% of participants, with those significantly at higher risk being male, non-Saudis, black Africans, and 70-79 years old. The knowledge level was found to be high among 54.7% of participants, with significantly higher levels being reported among females, non-Saudis, and participants who were either physicians or pharmacists. The most commonly cited source of knowledge was the Saudi Ministry of Health (82%). Participants largely demonstrated a positive attitude towards the disease (53.9%), particularly those working as physicians and in the governmental sector. The majority of participants (54.4%) were found to have a high level of fear toward the disease, with significantly higher levels being reported among females, 30-39 years old, and those who were either nurses or pharmacists.

634,34976649,"Knowledge of HIV and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis among medical and pharmacy students: A national, multi-site, cross-sectional study.  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective strategy for preventing HIV. However, prescription of PrEP has not reached the scale that is necessary to meet the public health need of reducing HIV incidence. A factor contributing to this slow scale-up is limited healthcare practitioners' knowledge of PrEP, making PrEP education a priority. We conducted a national, cross-sectional study of medical (allopathic and osteopathic) and pharmacy students regarding knowledge of PrEP and HIV between October 2020 and February 2021. We included 28 items in our knowledge assessment. Analysis sought to identify gaps in knowledge as well as academic and demographic correlates of knowledge. A total of 2,353 students participated in the study (response rate = 17.0%). The overall mean HIV knowledge score was 79.6% correct. Regarding specific items, 68.7% of participants believed HIV treatment was difficult because it required many pills, and 61.1% incorrectly indicated a person with an undetectable HIV viral load could transmit the virus to their sexual partners. Overall mean PrEP knowledge was 84.1%. Approximately one-third of participants did not identify HIV-negative status as a requirement to be a PrEP candidate. Gay/lesbian participants and those who were in the late-phase of training reported higher knowledge of both HIV and PrEP than did heterosexual participants and those in the early-phase of training.

636,34976698,"Knowledge and self-efficacy among healthcare providers towards novel tobacco products in Japan.  Several new tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTPs), have become highly prevalent in Japan. As safety data continues to evolve, healthcare providers are considered important sources for product use, yet little is known about provider knowledge or self-efficacy to counsel patient about novel tobacco product use. This cross-sectional study used data from a Japanese Association of Smoking Control Science (JASCS) online survey of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and public health practitioners (N = 277) to assess provider knowledge of novel tobacco products and self-efficacy to counsel patients about product use. Correlates of knowledge and self-efficacy were also assessed. More than half the sample had received previous training in treating tobacco use, but 62% of respondents had no knowledge of HTPs; 80% of respondents indicated that they occasionally or always provide smoking cessation support. Overall knowledge of HTPs was low (41.4% correct) with higher knowledge for HTPs containing nicotine (89% correct) vs. HTPs emitting no carbon monoxide (25%). Self-efficacy to counsel patients about novel tobacco products was low on a scale ranging from 10 to 70 (Mean = 31.2; Standard Deviation = 16.7). Greater knowledge of HTPs was associated with male gender, higher rates of training at JASCS and previous learning about HTPs at JASCS. (p < 0.05).

Background The World Health Organization considers medication errors to be an issue that requires attention at all levels of care, to reduce the severe and preventable harm related to drug therapy. Different standards for clinical pharmaceutical practices have been proposed by various organizations across the world, where the pharmacist, as part of the multidisciplinary health team, can help improve patient safety. Objective To assess the impact of the introduction of a clinical pharmacy practice model on medication error in patients of a university hospital. Setting The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, Medellín, Colombia. Methods A randomized, controlled cluster-wedge staggered trial with a duration of 14 months was conducted to compare the clinical pharmacy practice model with the usual care process in the hospital. Five hospital health care units were included, which were initially assigned to the control group, and after an observation period of 2 months, they were randomly assigned to the intervention group. The trial protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT03338725). Main outcome measure The incidence of medication errors in hospitalized patients was the main outcome measure. Results The incidence of medication error was 13.3% and 22.8% for the intervention group and control group, respectively. The probability of presenting a medication error was 48% lower when the patient was in the intervention group (RR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.79). The probability of presenting a medication error over time was 44% lower in the intervention group (p = 0.0005); meanwhile, the resolution of a medication error over time was 70% higher in the intervention group (p = 0. 0029). Conclusion The clinical pharmacy practice model, made up of strategies focused on reducing medication errors, significantly reduces medication errors in patients during hospitalization compared with usual practice.

640,34978226,"Plant-derived nootropics and human cognition: A systematic review.  Substances with modulatory capabilities on certain aspects of human cognition have been revered as nootropics from the dawn of time. The plant kingdom provides most of the currently available nootropics of natural origin. Here, in this systematic review, we aim to provide state-of-the-art information regarding proven and unproven effects of plant-derived nootropics (PDNs) on human cognition in conditions of health and disease. Six independent searches, one for each neurocognitive domain (NCD), were performed in parallel using three independent scientific library databases: PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus. Only scientific studies and systematic reviews with humans published between January 2000 and November 2021 were reviewed, and 256 papers were included. Ginkgo biloba was the most relevant nootropic regarding perceptual and motor functions. Bacopa monnieri improves language, learning and memory. Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) modulates anxiety and social-related cognitions. Caffeine enhances attention and executive functions.

Objectives Community pharmacies have financial difficulties due to reasons such as economic crises in recent years, increased competition, reimbursement cuts, decreasing drug prices and profit ratio, and increasing operation costs. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the financial status of community pharmacies in Çorum and to guide future sectoral financial studies. Materials and Methods One of the most commonly used method to evaluate the financial status and performance of companies is the ""ratio analysis method"". This ratio analysis has been conducted by accounting that data of 51 of the 93 community pharmacies operating in Çorum city. Results Considering the results of the ratio analysis in general, the pharmacies in Çorum have liquidity problems. More than half of the pharmacies could not pay their short-term debts with their current assets in the years mentioned in the study. Community pharmacies take more debit/credit to pay their short-term debts. The debit burden of the pharmacies has increased in the years mentioned in the study. Pharmacies have a low stock turnover ratio, and their inventory managements are insufficient. Conclusion It is seen that the main reason for the financial problems in community pharmacies is the low efficiency and productivity loss in resource management. It is thought that it would be beneficial to provide financial management training at the undergraduate level in the faculties of pharmacy and to provide vocational trainings within the Turkish Pharmacists' Association (TEB).

Background Medication review is time-consuming and not exhaustive in most French hospitals. We routinely use an innovative hybrid decision support system using Artificial Intelligence to prioritize medication review by scoring prescriptions by their risk of containing at least one drug related problem (DRP). Aim Our aim was to attest that the prescriptions with low risk of DRPs ruled out by the tool in everyday practice were effectively free of any DRPs with potentially severe clinical impact. Methods We conducted a randomized single-blinded study to compare the rate of pharmaceutical interventions (PI) between low and high-risk prescriptions defined by the tool's calculated score. Prescriptions were reviewed daily by a clinical pharmacist. Proportion of prescriptions with at least one severe DRP was calculated in both groups. Severe DRPs were characterized through a multidisciplinary approach. Results Four hundred and twenty (107 low score and 313 high score) prescriptions were analyzed. The percentage of prescriptions with severe DRPs was dramatically decreased in low score prescriptions (2.8% vs. 15.3% for high-risk; p = 0.0248). A significant difference was found (94% vs. 20%; p < 0.001) in the percentage of severe DRPs detected by the hybrid approach compared to a CDSS. During the study period, the hybrid tool allowed to rule out 55% of all prescriptions in our hospital.Conclusion This hybrid decision support tool has shown to be accurate to detect DRPs in daily practice. Despite some limitations, it offers the best possible solution to prioritized medication review, considering the shortage of clinical pharmacists in France and considerably improves the safety of patients' care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: Medical use of cannabis is growing in popularity across the United States, but medical education and clinician comfort discussing cannabis use for medical purposes have not kept pace. Materials and Methods: A total of 344 clinicians in the state of Pennsylvania (response rate 14%) completed a brief online survey about their attitudes, training, and experiences regarding medical cannabis and certifying patients to use medical cannabis. Results: Only 51% of clinicians reported completing any formal training on medical cannabis. Compared with noncertifying clinicians (pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants), physicians were significantly more comfortable with patient use of medical cannabis, saw fewer risks, more benefits, and felt better prepared to discuss its use with vulnerable populations. All clinicians noted significant limitations to their understanding of how medical cannabis can affect patients, and many indicated a desire for more research and training to fill in gaps in their knowledge. Conclusions: Insufficient medical curricula on the medical uses of cannabis are available to interprofessional clinicians across their disciplines, and clinicians report significant deficits in their knowledge base about its effects.

BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine acceptance is influenced by the trusted recommenders. This survey examined the public references, concerns, and trust in seven groups of recommenders regarding COVID-19 vaccine in Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1,579 participants between April 16 and July 16, 2021. Participants' references, concerns, and responses to vaccination recommendations made by government officials, employers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, senior family members, and religious leaders were captured using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS Rates of trust ranged from 18.5% to 89.1%. The highest rates were attributable to government (89.1%) and physicians (85.9%). Less than half of participants would accept the vaccines if pharmacists (45.5%), nurses (44.7%), employers (42.4%), senior family members (28.1%), and religious leaders (18.4%) recommended it. Only 37.6% of participants thought that vaccines were safe for them, while 57% were unsure. Most participants would wait and see how people respond to the vaccines before getting vaccinated (91.5%), preferred to receive the vaccines at public hospitals (88.6%), and were concerned about vaccine effectiveness (86.9%) and side effects (76.4%), while 61.8% were concerned about vaccine cost. CONCLUSION Focusing on the personal benefit and relying on the government, physicians, and social role models would make the vaccine advertising campaigns more effective. If annual vaccinations were needed, providing the community with affordable vaccines would be an appropriate, long-term solution to ensure vaccination coverage in low-resource countries like Vietnam.

Materials and Methods ""Colleague Solidarity Scale Among Nurses"" was used in this study conducted with the questionnaire technique. The scale comprises of 23 items and was scored using a 5-point Likert scale. In addition, there were three demographic questions and six questions to get information from participants related to collegial solidarity in the questionnaire. Results As a result of the exploratory factor analysis (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin: 0.837), three factors reported 51.029% of the total variance. The t-test indicated a significant difference between gender groups only in the negative opinions about solidarity (NOS) factor (p=0.000). Females exhibited more negative thoughts about solidarity. The ANOVA showed a significant difference in the academic solidarity (AS) factor (p=0.007) among the participants' works in community pharmacies and universities. Pharmacists working in universities had higher means in the AS factor. Moreover, the number of working years made significant differences in the emotional solidarity factor (p=0.000) and NOS factor (p=0.002). Additionally, it was found that the average responses in all factors of the participants who thought that they supported their colleagues in need and that solidarity with their colleagues increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic period (p<0.05).

Recent Belgian data on ambulatory antibiotic prescribing practices for children are currently lacking. Therefore, we aim to analyse different aspects of antibiotic prescriptions for children in ambulatory care. METHODS Pharmacy dispensing data on antibiotics for systematic use referring from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from Farmanet, a database of pharmaceutical dispensations in community pharmacies. Population data were obtained from the Belgian statistical office (Statbel). Descriptive statistics were performed in Microsoft Excel. The Mann-Kendall test for trend analysis and the seasplot function for seasonality testing were conducted in R. RESULTS The past decade, paediatric antibiotic use and expenditures have relatively decreased in Belgian ambulatory care with 35.5% and 44.3%, respectively. The highest volumes of antibiotics for children are prescribed by GPs working in Walloon region and rural areas, to younger children, and during winter. The most prescribed class of antibiotics for children are the penicillins and the biggest relative reduction in number of packages is seen for the sulfonamides and trimethoprim and quinolone antibacterials. CONCLUSIONS Paediatric antibiotic use has decreased in Belgian ambulatory care. Further initiatives are needed to promote prudent antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
652,34980098,"Using communities of practice as a lens for exploring experiential pharmacy learning in general practice: Are communities of practice the way forward in changing the training culture in pharmacy? BACKGROUND Currently, there is little experiential learning in general practice (GP) during UK undergraduate and postgraduate pharmacy education and training. AIM To apply educational theories to explore pharmacy stakeholders' perceptions of placements in general practice and contribute to the development of a model of experiential learning for pharmacy. METHODS Qualitative, semi-structured interviews, conducted as part of two studies exploring experiential learning in general practice, with learners and their GP based supervisors. Interviews explored experiences of learning and practice, and what aided or hindered this. An abductive approach to analysis combined inductive coding with deductive, theory-driven interpretation using Lave and Wenger's concept of ""Communities of Practice"". RESULTS Forty-four interviews were conducted, with learners and placement supervisors. Participants valued placements for providing authentic patient-facing learning experiences in the workplace, facilitated through legitimate peripheral participation by supervisors and supported by the use of pre- and de-briefing. Learners benefitted from support from their supervisor(s) and other staff during their day-to-day learning (informal learning), whilst also having protected time with their supervisors to discuss learning needs or go through workplace-based assessments (formal learning). Lack of clarity regarding which and how competencies should be assessed / demonstrated in general practice challenged monitoring progress from peripheral to full participation. Findings suggest that GP placements provide opportunities for learning about the patient journey between care settings; to work effectively with multidisciplinary teams; and consolidation and application of consultation / communication skills learning. CONCLUSIONS The learning culture of GP supports learners' development, providing time and opportunities for meaningful and authentic workplace learning, with healthcare professionals acting as supervisors and mentors. These findings can usefully inform implementation of meaningful learning opportunities in primary and secondary care for those involved in pharmacy education and training.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
653,34980147,"Use of research evidence varied in efforts to expand specific pharmacist autonomous prescriptive authority: an evaluation and recommendations to increase research utilization. BACKGROUND An expanding body of literature shows that pharmacists' interventions improve health outcomes and are cost-saving. However, diverse state regulations of pharmacists' scope of practice create a discrepancy between what pharmacists are trained to do and what they legally can do. This study investigated how stakeholders utilized research evidence when developing expanded scope of practice policies in their respective states. METHODS Using autonomous pharmacist prescriptive authority as a surrogate for general pharmacist scope of practice, a general policy document analysis was performed to understand the scope of practice landscape for pharmacists across the United States. Next, semi-structured interviews with policy-makers and pharmacy advocates were conducted to explore how the identified states in the policy document analysis utilized evidence during the policy-making process. Investigators analysed findings from the transcribed interviews through application of the SPIRIT Action Framework. Resulting codes were summarized across themes, and recommendations to researchers about increasing utilization of research evidence were crafted. RESULTS Sixteen states with 27 autonomous pharmacist prescriptive authority policies were identified. Public health need and safety considerations motivated evidence engagement, while key considerations dictating utilization of research included perceptions of research, access to resources and experts, and the successful implementation of similar policy. Research evidence helped to advocate for and set terms for pharmacist prescribing. Barriers to research utilization include stakeholder opposition to pharmacist prescribing, inability to interpret research, and a lack of relevant evidence. Recommendations for researchers include investigating specific metrics to evaluate scope of practice policy, developing relationships between policy-makers and researchers, and leveraging pharmacy practice stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS Overall, alignment of researcher goals and legislative priorities, coupled with timely communication, may help to increase research evidence engagement in pharmacist scope of practice policy. By addressing these factors regarding research engagement identified in this study, researchers can increase evidence-based scope of practice, which can help to improve patient outcomes, contain costs, and provide pharmacists with the legal infrastructure to practise at the top of their license.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
654,34980596,"Impact of hospital pharmacist-delivered individualised pharmaceutical service intervention on clinical and patient-reported outcomes in patients with hypertension: a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES Patients with hypertension in Nepal are often known to have poor medication adherence and quality of life. This randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the impact of a hospital pharmacist-delivered individualised pharmaceutical service (P-DIPS) intervention on blood pressure, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with hypertension in a hospital setting in Nepal. METHODS In an open trial, 56 adult patients with hypertension who had been receiving antihypertensive medication for ≥6 months were randomly allocated to a control group (n=28) which received the usual care and an intervention group (n=28) which received a P-DIPS along with the usual care. The difference in blood pressure, medication adherence and HRQoL between the two groups at baseline, 2 and 4 months was compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, independent t-test or χ2 tests. RESULTS Participants were mostly ≥40 years (86%) and female (57%). There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the control (C) and intervention (I) groups. At 2 months, the two groups had a significant improvement in the median (IQR) Morisky-Green-Levine (MGL) Medication Adherence Score (I=1 (2) vs C=2 (2); p<0.001) and the median (IQR) mental component of HRQoL (I=43.6 (9.5) vs C=37.5 (8.6); p=0.013). At 4 months, there were significant differences in the median (IQR) values of all the outcome measures between the groups (systolic blood pressure: I=125 (10) mmHg vs C=130 (15) mmHg, p=0.008; diastolic blood pressure: 80 (14) mmHg vs 90 (10) mmHg, p=0.012; MGL score: I=1 (1) vs C=2 (1), p<0.001; physical component of HRQoL: 45.0 (9.0) vs 40.3 (8.2), p=0.046; and mental component of HRQoL: 47.1 (11.1) vs 38.8 (8.5), p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that a P-DIPS intervention in the hospital setting of Nepal has a significant potential to improve blood pressure, medication adherence and HRQoL in patients with hypertension.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Ambulatory,
655,34980762,"Telepharmacy in mountainous depopulated areas of Japan: an exploratory interview study of patients' perspectives.  Japan has an ageing population and geographical impediments to healthcare access, so an experimental trial of telepharmacy has recently been implemented in remote islands or remote areas of Japan prior to the formal implementation. This exploratory study was conducted to understand patients' perspectives on telepharmacy in a mountainous depopulated area away from urban areas of Japan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four elderly patients, who were all of the patients receiving telepharmacy in Toyone village, Japan, at the time of the survey. The transcribed interview data were qualitatively analyzed by coding and categorization. The subjects thought telepharmacy would be advantageous to overcome poor access to a clinic and to improve convenience in processes ranging from medical examination to obtaining prescribed medicines. However, they pointed out the low digital literacy of the elderly. Also, they had low expectations for pharmacists, because they had previously had no relationship with pharmacists due to lack of pharmacies in the area. To promote telepharmacy, efforts to eliminate resistance to smartphones and to provide support for smartphone operations are needed among the elderly. Work is also needed to establish how pharmacists should best be involved in patient care and health support in remote areas. Our findings suggest that telepharmacy is useful in remote areas of Japan, but in locations where there is no existing relationship with pharmacists, it would be desirable for pharmacists to be actively involved with the community to maximize its effectiveness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
656,34980775,"External Evaluation of a Bayesian Warfarin Dose Optimization Based on a Kinetic-Pharmacodynamic Model.  Warfarin is a representative anticoagulant with large interindividual variability. The published kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-PD) model allows the prediction of warfarin dose requirement in Swedish patients; however, its applicability in Japanese patients is not known. We evaluated the model's predictive performance in Japanese patients with various backgrounds and relationships using Bayesian parameter estimation and sampling times. A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted at Tokyo Women's Medical University, Medical Center East. The study population consisted of adult patients aged >20 years who commenced warfarin with a prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) from June 2015 to June 2019. The published K-PD model modified by Wright and Duffull was assessed using prediction-corrected visual predictive checks, focusing on clinical characteristics, including age, renal function, and individual prediction error. The external dataset included 232 patients who received an initial warfarin daily dose of 3.2 ± 1.28 mg with 2278 PT-INR points (median [range] follow-up period of 23 d [7-28]). Prediction-corrected visual predictive checks carried a propensity for underprediction. Additionally, age >60 years, body mass index ≤25 kg/m2, and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a pronounced tendency to underpredict PT-INR. However, Bayesian prediction using four prior observations reduced underprediction. To improve the prediction performance of these special populations, further studies are required to construct a model to predict warfarin dose requirements in Japanese patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
657,34981347,"Reducing Sedative-Hypnotics Among Hospitalized Patients: a Multi-centered Study. BACKGROUND Sedative-hypnotics are frequently prescribed for insomnia in hospital but are associated with preventable harms. OBJECTIVE, DESIGN, AND PARTICIPANTS We aimed to examine whether a sedative-hypnotic reduction quality improvement bundle decreases the rate of sedative-hypnotic use among hospitalized patients, who were previously naïve to sedative-hypnotics. This interrupted time series study occurred between May 2016 and January 2019. Control data for 1 year prior to implementation and intervention data for at least 16 months were collected. The study occurred on 7 inpatient wards (general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery wards) across 5 teaching hospitals in Toronto, Canada. INTERVENTION Participating wards implemented a sedative-hypnotic reduction bundle (i.e., order set changes, audit-feedback, pharmacist-enabled medication reviews, sleep hygiene, daily sleep huddles, and staff/patient/family education) aimed to reduce in-hospital sedative-hypnotic initiation for insomnia in patients who were previously naïve to sedative-hypnotics. Each inpatient ward adapted the bundle prior to sustaining the intervention for a minimum of 16 months. MAIN MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the proportion of sedative-hypnotic-naïve inpatients newly prescribed a sedative-hypnotic for sleep in hospital. Secondary measures include prescribing rates of other sedating medications, fall rates, length of stay, and mortality. KEY RESULTS We included 8,970 patient discharges in the control period and 10,120 in the intervention period. Adjusted sedative-hypnotic prescriptions among naïve patients decreased from 15.48% (95% CI: 6.09-19.42) to 9.08% (p<0.001) (adjusted OR 0.814; 95% CI: 0.667-0.993, p=0.042). Unchanged secondary outcomes included mortality (adjusted OR 1.089; 95% CI: 0.786-1.508, p=0.608), falls (adjusted rate ratio 0.819; 95% CI: 0.625-1.073, p=0.148), or other sedating drug prescriptions (adjusted OR 1.046; 95% CI: 0.873-1.252, p=0.627).

658,34981359,"Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Initiation and Continuation: a Qualitative Study of Patients Who Received Addiction Consultation and Hospital-Based Providers. BACKGROUND Hospitalizations related to opioid use disorder (OUD) are rising. Addiction consultation services (ACS) increasingly provide OUD treatment to hospitalized patients, but barriers to initiating and continuing medications for OUD remain. We examined facilitators and barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation from the perspective of patients and healthcare workers in the context of an ACS. METHODS In this qualitative study, we sought input using key informant interviews and focus groups from patients who received care from an ACS during their hospitalization and from hospitalists, pharmacists, social workers, and nurses who work in the hospital setting. A multidisciplinary team coded and analyzed transcripts using a directed content analysis. FINDINGS We conducted 20 key informant interviews with patients, nine of whom were interviewed following hospital discharge and 12 of whom were interviewed during a rehospitalization. We completed six focus groups and eight key informant interviews with hospitalists and hospital-based medical staff (n = 62). Emergent themes related to hospital-based OUD treatment included the following: the benefit of an ACS to facilitate OUD treatment engagement; expanded use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid withdrawal; the triad of hospitalization, self-efficacy, and easily accessible, patient-centered treatment motivates change in opioid use; adequate pain control and stabilization of mental health conditions among patients with OUD contributed to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) continuation; and stable housing and social support are prerequisites for OAT uptake and continuation. CONCLUSION Modifiable factors which facilitate hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation include availability of in-hospital addiction expertise to offer easily accessible, patient-centered treatment and the use of methadone or buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal. Further research and public policy efforts are urgently needed to address reported barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation which include unstable housing, poorly controlled chronic medical and mental illness, and lack of social support.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
659,34981361,"Is Sociodemographic Status Associated with Empathic Communication and Decision Quality in Diabetes Care? OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between empathic communication, shared decision-making, and patient sociodemographic factors of income, education, and ethnicity in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a cross-sectional study from five primary care practices in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, participating in a randomized controlled trial of a diabetes goal setting and shared decision-making plan. Participants included 30 patients with diabetes and 23 clinicians (physicians, nurses, dietitians, and pharmacists), with a sample size of 48 clinical encounters. Clinical encounter audiotapes were coded using the Empathic Communication Coding System (ECCS) and Decision Support Analysis Tool (DSAT-10). RESULTS The most frequent empathic responses among encounters were ""acknowledgement with pursuit"" (28.9%) and ""confirmation"" (30.0%). The most frequently assessed DSAT components were ""stage"" (86%) and knowledge of options (82.0%). ECCS varied by education (p=0.030) and ethnicity (p=0.03), but not income. Patients with only a college degree received more empathic communication than patients with bachelor's degrees or more, and South Asian patients received less empathic communication than Asian patients. DSAT varied with ethnicity (p=0.07) but not education or income. White patients experienced more shared decision-making than those in the ""other"" category. CONCLUSIONS We identified a new relationship between ECCS, education and ethnicity, as well as DSAT and ethnicity. Limitations include sample size, heterogeneity of encounters, and predominant white ethnicity. These associations may be evidence of systemic biases in healthcare, with hidden roots in medical education.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

661,34982776,"Predicting dispensing errors in community pharmacies: An application of the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA). INTRODUCTION The objective of this study was to use a prospective error analysis method to examine the process of dispensing medication in community pharmacy settings and identify remedial solutions to avoid potential errors, categorising them as strong, intermediate, or weak based on an established patient safety action hierarchy tool. METHOD Focus group discussions and non-participant observations were undertaken to develop a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), and subsequent focus group discussions applied the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) focusing on the task of dispensing medication in community pharmacies. Remedial measures identified through the SHERPA analysis were then categorised as strong, intermediate, or weak based on the Veteran Affairs National Centre for Patient Safety action hierarchy. Non-participant observations were conducted at 3 pharmacies, totalling 12 hours, based in England. Additionally, 7 community pharmacists, with experience ranging from 8 to 38 years, participated in a total of 4 focus groups, each lasting between 57 to 85 minutes, with one focus group discussing the HTA and three applying SHERPA. A HTA was produced consisting of 10 sub-tasks, with further levels of sub-tasks within each of them. RESULTS Overall, 88 potential errors were identified, with a total of 35 remedial solutions proposed to avoid these errors in practice. Sixteen (46%) of these remedial measures were categorised as weak, 14 (40%) as intermediate and 5 (14%) as strong according to the Veteran Affairs National Centre for Patient Safety action hierarchy. Sub-tasks with the most potential errors were identified, which included 'producing medication labels' and 'final checking of medicines'. The most common type of error determined from the SHERPA analysis related to omitting a check during the dispensing process which accounted for 19 potential errors. DISCUSSION This work applies both HTA and SHERPA for the first time to the task of dispensing medication in community pharmacies, detailing the complexity of the task and highlighting potential errors and remedial measures specific to this task. Future research should examine the effectiveness of the proposed remedial solutions to improve patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
662,34983680,"Polypharmacy and the occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions among geriatric patients at the outpatient pharmacy department of a regional hospital in Durban, South Africa. BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is the administration of an excessive number of medicines and a significant irrational medicine use practice. Little is known about this practice in South Africa. This study aimed to determine the level of polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions amongst the geriatric patient population in a facility in South Africa. METHOD A cross-sectional retrospective prescription chart review for 250 geriatric patients was conducted at the outpatient pharmacy department of a regional hospital. Variables extracted included demographic information, diagnosis, type of prescriber contact, and polypharmacy. Potential drug-drug interactions were determined with web-based multi-drug interaction checkers. RESULTS The average (SD) number of diagnosed clinical problems was 3.54 ± 1.26, with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease occurring most frequently. The level of polypharmacy was high with patients receiving an average (SD) of 12.13 ± 4.25 prescribed medicines from 3032 prescribed medicines. The level of polypharmacy was highest within the age categories, 60-64, and 70-74 years of age, respectively. The level of potential drug-drug interactions was also high with an average (SD) of 10.30 ± 7.48 from 2570 potential drug interactions. The majority of these interactions were moderate (72.5%) and pharmacodynamic (73.2%) by nature of the clinical severity of action and mechanism of action, respectively. Polypharmacy and type of prescriber contact were statistically significant contributors to the occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions, (F (2, 249) = 68.057, p < 0.05). However, in a multivariate analysis of variables to determine the strength of the association, polypharmacy was determined to be the strongest contributor to the occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions (p < 0.05) when compared with the type of prescriber contact (p value = 0.467). Therefore, irrespective of the type of prescriber contact, polypharmacy increases the potential for drug interactions among the sampled patient population. CONCLUSION A comprehensive consideration of disease management guidelines, patient factors, and rational medicine review could be measurable strategies towards improving medicine use. This would also limit the occurrence of significant drug interactions among the geriatric patient population. A national study is required to determine if differences occur across hospitals and regions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
663,34983888,"Care Coordination Processes in Transitional Care for Patients With Heart Failure: An Integrative Review Through a Social Network Lens. BACKGROUND Transitional care components are well studied, but their coordination has not been systematically reviewed. Viewing transitional care through a social network framework can focus attention on processes leading to information and relationship transferal to ensure continuity and may lead to new strategies to improve transitional care. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine care coordination processes in transitional care interventions for older adults with heart failure by integrating a social network analysis approach. METHODS PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched to capture transitional care interventions (a) involving care coordination for older adults with heart failure transitioning from hospital to home and (b) published in the United States from 2010 to 2020. Study characteristics, intervention characteristics, and care coordination processes (ie, participants, interactions among participants, and their characteristics) were extracted. RESULTS In 17 studies reviewed, the number of individual roles involved in care coordination varied from 3 to 32. Nurses and pharmacists were the most common interventionists. Six studies involved informal caregivers. In-person interactions were most common among individuals within settings; interactions across settings were typically assisted by technology. Despite high variability among the individuals and interactions involved, a common triadic process was found through which interventionists, patients, and primary care providers or outpatient cardiologists aimed to facilitate the transfer of information and care relationships from hospital to community. CONCLUSIONS High variability in transitional care is likely because the processes are highly relational. Using a network analysis may help uncover the relational structures and processes underlying transitional care to inform intervention development.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

665,34984853,"Pharmacy and medical student interprofessional education placement week. BACKGROUND Developing collaborative practice through interprofessional education (IPE) activities in undergraduate healthcare curricula is advocated by the World Health Organisation and the regulatory bodies for Medicine and Pharmacy within the UK. APPROACH Our local faculty, comprising educators from within the Highland Pharmacy Education and Research Centre (HPERC) and Highland Medical Education Centre (HMEC), developed a 5-day IPE placement for pharmacy and medical students on clinical placement within NHS Highland. EVALUATION We collected qualitative evaluation data using face-to-face focus group discussions with five pharmacy and four medical students (January 2020 cohort). Three key categories and multiple themes within each category were identified from participant narratives: Category 1, overall perception of experience-(themes: better than previous IPE experience; greater exposure to clinical pharmacy); Category 2, student interactions-(themes: learning with a buddy; understanding of interprofessional roles); Category 3, suggestions for improvement-(themes: choice of relevant clinical rotation and content; increase learning from clinical pharmacists; better orientation to placement). Overall, students valued their participation during this week and reported many benefits of learning with students from another profession. Students also highlighted suggestions to improve their learning experience. IMPLICATIONS This evaluation has indicated students' support for embedding interprofessional placements into their curricula. Clinical educators should consider designing similar placements, while further work should focus on inclusion of higher student numbers and look to include a range of professions and practice settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
666,34986166,"GP-delivered medication review of polypharmacy, deprescribing, and patient priorities in older people with multimorbidity in Irish primary care (SPPiRE Study): A cluster randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND There is a rising prevalence of multimorbidity, particularly in older patients, and a need for evidence-based medicines management interventions for this population. The Supporting Prescribing in Older Adults with Multimorbidity in Irish Primary Care (SPPiRE) trial aimed to investigate the effect of a general practitioner (GP)-delivered, individualised medication review in reducing polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) in community-dwelling older patients with multimorbidity in primary care. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) set in 51 GP practices throughout the Republic of Ireland. A total of 404 patients, aged ≥65 years with complex multimorbidity, defined as being prescribed ≥15 regular medicines, were recruited from April 2017 and followed up until October 2020. Furthermore, 26 intervention GP practices received access to the SPPiRE website where they completed an educational module and used a template for an individualised patient medication review that identified PIP, opportunities for deprescribing, and patient priorities for care. A total of 25 control GP practices delivered usual care. An independent blinded pharmacist assessed primary outcome measures that were the number of medicines and the proportion of patients with any PIP (from a predefined list of 34 indicators based predominantly on the STOPP/START version 2 criteria). We performed an intention-to-treat analysis using multilevel modelling. Recruited participants had substantial disease and treatment burden at baseline with a mean of 17.37 (standard deviation [SD] 3.50) medicines. At 6-month follow-up, both intervention and control groups had reductions in the numbers of medicines with a small but significantly greater reduction in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.899 to 0.999, p = 0.045). There was no significant effect on the odds of having at least 1 PIP in the intervention versus control group (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI: 0.140 to 1.064, p = 0.066). Adverse events recorded included mortality, emergency department (ED) presentations, and adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWEs), and there was no evidence of harm. Less than 2% of drug withdrawals in the intervention group led to a reported ADWE. Due to the inability to electronically extract data, primary outcomes were measured at just 2 time points, and this is the main limitation of this work. CONCLUSIONS The SPPiRE intervention resulted in a small but significant reduction in the number of medicines but no evidence of a clear effect on PIP. This reduction in significant polypharmacy may have more of an impact at a population rather than individual patient level. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN12752680.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION By measuring patients' satisfaction, providers can gain insight into several elements of health care services, including the effectiveness of their care and the level of empathy they exhibit. The aim of this study was to assess patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical services and associated factors in public hospitals located in Northwestern Ethiopia. METHODS An institution-based quantitative cross-sectional study was used. The study was carried out in an outpatient pharmacy from January 1-June 30, 2021. Participants were selected by a systematic sampling technique. The IBM SPSS statistical package (version 23) was used to enter and analyze the collected data. The findings were presented using descriptive statistical methods. To find factors linked to satisfaction, binary logistic regression was used. RESULTS The final analysis included a total of 401 samples. More than half of the participants (229, or 55.1%) were female. The overall mean score of satisfaction was 30.6 out of a maximum of 100 scores. By taking this mean score as a cut-off point, 204 (50.9%) of the study participants had satisfaction with the outpatient pharmacists' service. Participants' responses scored on the uncomfortable and inconvenient waiting areas [AOR = 0.31; 95%CI, (0.13, 0.49)] were found to be negatively associated with the level of patients' satisfaction. Also, the unavailability of medications [AOR = 0.12; 95%CI, (0.02, 0.37)] was negatively associated with the respondent satisfaction. Uncomfortable and inconvenient private counseling areas [AOR = 1.37; 95%CI, (0.79, 4.42)] showed a negative association with their satisfaction. CONCLUSION Patients' satisfaction levels with pharmacy service were found to be greater than 50%. The socio-demographic characteristics of patients have no association with their level of satisfaction, but their perception of uncomfortable private counseling areas and waiting areas was negatively associated with their satisfaction.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine and summarize policies and procedures for peer evaluation of teaching/instructional coaching (PET/IC) programs within departments, schools, and colleges of pharmacy and to identify opportunities for improving these based on best practices.Methods. A survey was sent to all ACPE-accredited pharmacy programs to collect information regarding procedures to support and evaluate PET/IC programs across institutions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the general features of PET/IC programs and inferential statistics were used to make group comparisons based on institutional control (public, private) and institution age (0-10 year, older than 10 years).Results. Surveys for 91 institutions were completed (response rate = 64.5%). Most institutions (78.4%) reported having a PET/IC program. Most institutions with PET/IC programs reported using a combination of formative and summative evaluations (57.4%). Faculty development (35.8%) and improving teaching (35.8%) were the top purposes for PET/IC programs. Almost half of the PET/IC programs (46.3%) were mandatory for all faculty at the institutions. Most institutions (66.7%) had one standardized instrument used in their PET/IC program. Few institutions (11.9%) reported evaluating or being in the process of evaluating the effectiveness or success of their PET/IC program. Private institutions were more likely to incentivize observers than public institutions (17.1% vs. 0%).Conclusion.

671,34987259,"Nocturnal Hypoglycemia Associated with Bedtime Administration of Premixed Insulin Preparations in Hospitalized Patients. Background Patients with diabetes mellitus for whom premixed insulin preparations (PMIPs) are ordered in the hospital setting may be at risk of hypoglycemia if the PMIP is incorrectly administered at bedtime (instead of suppertime). Objectives The primary objective was to determine, retrospectively, the incidence of bedtime administration of PMIPs at a tertiary teaching hospital. The secondary objective was to investigate whether bedtime administration of PMIPs led to an increase in nocturnal hypoglycemia. Methods Inpatient PMIP orders for the period April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2017, were extracted from the pharmacy information system of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Two hundred randomly selected inpatient admissions were audited, and instances of PMIP administration after 2000 (8 pm) were recorded. Data from an additional random sample of inpatient admissions, from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, were reviewed to determine whether bedtime administration of PMIPs was associated with increased incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia, relative to suppertime administration. Results In the randomly selected sample of 200 inpatient admissions, a PMIP was administered at bedtime at least once during 47 admissions (24%). In the additional sample of 123 inpatient admissions during which a PMIP had been administered, the mean nocturnal hypoglycemia rate was 4.15% for suppertime administration and 14.85% for bedtime administration (p = 0.13). Conclusions For a substantial proportion of patients, PMIPs were inappropriately ordered and administered at bedtime in this hospital setting and may have been associated with nocturnal hypoglycemic events. Recommendations to reduce this practice include ongoing education and a review of preprinted order sets. Contexte Les patients atteints de diabète sucré pour lesquels des préparations d’insuline prémélangées (PIPM) sont commandées en milieu hospitalier peuvent présenter un risque d’hypoglycémie si elles sont administrées à tort au coucher (au lieu de l’heure du souper). Objectifs L’objectif principal visait à déterminer, rétrospectivement, l’incidence de l’administration des PIPM au coucher dans un hôpital d’enseignement tertiaire. L’objectif secondaire visait quant à lui à déterminer si l’administration au coucher entraînait (ou non) une augmentation de l’hypoglycémie nocturne. Méthodes Les données relatives aux commandes de PIPM pour les patients hospitalisés pendant la période du 1er avril 2013 au 31 mars 2017 ont été extraites du système d’information pharmaceutique du QEII Health Sciences Centre à Halifax (N.-É.). Deux cents admissions de patients hospitalisés sélectionnées au hasard ont été vérifiées et les cas d’administration des PIPM après 2000 (20 h) ont été enregistrés. Les données d’un échantillon aléatoire supplémentaire d’admissions de patients hospitalisés du 1er janvier 2016 au 31 décembre 2017 ont été examinées afin de déterminer si l’administration au coucher des PIPM était associée à une plus grande incidence d’hypoglycémie nocturne, par rapport à l’administration au souper. Résultats Dans l’échantillon sélectionné au hasard de 200 admissions de patients hospitalisés, une PIPM a été administrée au coucher au moins une fois au cours de 47 admissions (24 %). Dans l’échantillon supplémentaire de 123 admissions de patients hospitalisés au cours desquelles une PIPM avait été administrée, le taux moyen d’hypoglycémie nocturne était de 4,15 % pour l’administration au souper et se montait à 14,85 % pour l’administration au coucher (p = 0,13). Conclusions Pour une proportion considérable de patients, la PIPM a été prescrite de manière inappropriée et administrée au coucher dans ce milieu hospitalier et peut avoir été associée à des événements hypoglycémiques nocturnes. Les recommandations visant à réduire cette pratique comprennent une formation continue et un examen des ensembles de commandes préimprimés.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
672,34987262,"Health Care Professionals' Perceptions of the Role of the Clinical Pharmacist and Expanded Pharmacist Coverage in Critical Care. Background During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage by critical care pharmacists (CCPs) was expanded in 2 medical-surgical intensive care units at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, excluding holidays, to 8 hours per day, 7 days per week, including holidays. Objectives To describe health care professionals' opinions about and perceived impacts of the expanded CCP coverage on patient care, as well as their opinions about the role of the CCP as a member of the critical care team. Methods An electronic 22-item survey was distributed to critical care health care professionals to capture opinions and perceived impacts of expanded CCP coverage. The perceived importance of 25 evidence-informed CCP activities was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Results Thirty-eight complete responses were included (15% response rate, based on distribution of the survey to 249 health care professionals). Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the following statements: CCPs are integral members of the critical care team (34/38 [89%]), CCPs play an important role in improving patient outcomes (34/38 [89%]), the presence of CCPs on the unit and on patient care rounds allows other health care professionals to concentrate on their own professional responsibilities (33/38 [87%]), and the expanded CCP coverage improved patient care (29/35 [83%]). Respondents most frequently categorized 23 of the 25 CCP activities as very important. Conclusions Expanded CCP coverage was perceived to have a positive effect on both patient care and members of the critical care team. Most CCP activities were perceived as very important. Given the findings of this quality project, novel staffing models are being explored to optimize CCP coverage. Contexte Au cours de la première vague de la pandémie de COVID-19, la couverture par les pharmaciens de soins intensifs (PSI) a été étendue dans 2 unités de soins intensifs médico-chirurgicaux du Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, à Halifax (Nouvelle-Écosse) : de 8 heures par jour, 5 jours par semaine, hors jours fériés, la couverture est passée à 8 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, y compris les jours fériés. Objectifs Décrire les opinions des professionnels de la santé sur la couverture élargie des PSI et leurs perceptions des incidences de celle-ci sur les soins aux patients, ainsi que le rôle des PSI en tant que membres de l’équipe de soins intensifs. Méthodes Un sondage électronique comportant 22 questions a été distribué aux professionnels de la santé en soins intensifs pour recueillir les opinions et les impacts perçus de l›élargissement de la couverture des PSI. L’importance perçue des 25 activités des PSI fondées sur des données probantes a été évaluée à l’aide d’une échelle de Likert à 5 points. Résultats Trente-huit réponses complètes ont été incluses (taux de réponse de 15 %, basé sur une distribution de l’enquête à 249 professionnels de la santé). La plupart des répondants étaient d’accord ou fortement d’accord avec les affirmations suivantes : « les PSI font partie intégrante de l’équipe de soins intensifs » (34/38, 89 %); « les PSI jouent un rôle important dans l’amélioration des résultats pour les patients » (34/38, 89 %); « la présence des PSI dans l’unité et lors des tournées de soins aux patients permet à d’autres professionnels de la santé de se concentrer sur leurs propres responsabilités professionnelles » (33/38, 87 %); et « la couverture élargie des PSI a amélioré les soins aux patients » (29/35, 83 %). Les répondants ont le plus souvent classé 23 des 25 activités du PSI comme « très importantes ». Conclusions L’élargissement de la couverture des PSI était perçu comme ayant un effet positif à la fois sur les soins aux patients et sur les membres de l’équipe de soins intensifs. La plupart des activités des PSI étaient perçues comme très importantes.

674,34988052,"What Is the Role of Pharmacists in Treating COVID-19 Patients? The Experiences and Expectations of Front Line Medical Staff.  Aims: The study aimed to understand the role and the core values of pharmacists and the professional expectations of medical staff for pharmacists in treating COVID-19 patients from the perspectives of the frontline medical staff. The findings help to understand and provide a reference for the career growth path of future pharmacists. Methods: A phenomenological method was used to conduct in-depth interviews with frontline medical staff working in isolation wards during COVID-19. The interview data were analyzed, and the themes were extracted. Results: Pharmacists played a positive role in ensuring the supply of non-routinely stocked drugs, including traditional Chinese medicine preventative preparations, providing drug information and medication consultation for complex patients, and identifying adverse drug reactions. However, at present, the integration of pharmacists and nurses is poor with inadequate communication, and the pharmaceutical care activities provided to physicians were still not comprehensive. Conclusions: The level of pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists needs to be further strengthened. Frontline medical teams generally have high professional expectations for pharmacists, including expecting pharmacists to become drug therapy experts. They expect pharmacists to fully participate in clinical decision-making, especially playing a central role in managing drug interactions, contraindications, and other clinical uses of drugs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
675,34988097,"Medication Errors in Secondary Care Hospitals in Kuwait: The Perspectives of Healthcare Professionals.  Objectives: Medication errors (MEs) are the most common cause of adverse drug events (ADEs) and one of the most encountered patient safety issues in clinical settings. This study aimed to determine the types of MEs in secondary care hospitals in Kuwait and identify their causes. Also, it sought to determine the existing system of error reporting in Kuwait and identify reporting barriers from the perspectives of healthcare professionals (HCPs). Material and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Full-time physicians, pharmacists, and nurses (aged 21 years and older) working in secondary care governmental hospitals in Kuwait were considered eligible to participate in the study. Descriptive statistics and the Statistical Package for Social Science Software (SPSS), version 27 were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 215 HCPs were approached and asked to take part in the study, of which 208 agreed, giving a response rate of 96.7%. Most HCPs (n = 129, 62.0%) reported that the most common type of ME is ""prescribing error,"" followed by ""compliance error"" (n = 83; 39.9%). Most HCPs thought that a high workload and lack of enough breaks (n = 128; 61.5%) were the most common causes of MEs, followed by miscommunication, either among medical staff or between staff and patients, which scored (n = 89; 42.8%) and (n = 82; 39.4%), respectively. In the past 12 months, 77.4% (n = 161) of HCPs reported that they did not fill out any ME incident reports. The lack of feedback (n = 65; 31.3%), as well as the length and complexity of the existing incident reporting forms (n = 63; 30.3%), were the major barriers against reporting any identified MEs. Conclusions: MEs are common in secondary care hospitals in Kuwait and can be found at many stages of practice. HCPs suggested many strategies to help reduce MEs, including proper communication between HCPs; double-checking every step of the process before administering medications to patients; providing training to keep HCPs up to date on any new treatment guidelines, and computerizing the health system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
676,34988443,"What does antimicrobial stewardship look like where you are? Global narratives from participants in a massive open online course. Background Whilst antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is being implemented globally, contextual differences exist. We describe how the use of a massive open online course (MOOC) platform provided an opportunity to gather diverse narratives on AMS from around the world. Methods A free 3 week MOOC titled 'Tackling antimicrobial resistance: a social science approach' was launched in November 2019. Learners were asked specific questions about their experiences of AMS via 38 optional free-text prompts dispersed throughout the modules. Content analysis was used to identify key emerging themes from the learners' responses in the first three runs of the MOOC. Results Between November 2019 and July 2020, 1464 learners enrolled from 114 countries. Overall, 199 individual learners provided a total of 1097 responses to the prompts. The diverse perspectives describe unique challenges present in different contexts including ill-defined roles for pharmacists and nurses in AMS; inadequate governance and policy inconsistencies in surveillance for antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in some countries; lack of ownership of antibiotic decision-making and buy-in from different clinical specialties; and human resource and technological constraints. Patients' knowledge, experiences and perspectives were recognized as a valuable source of information that should be incorporated in AMS initiatives to overcome cultural barriers to the judicious use of antibiotics. Conclusions Analysis of learner comments and reflections identified a range of enablers and barriers to AMS implementation across different healthcare economies. Common challenges to AMS implementation included the role of non-physician healthcare workers, resource limitations, gaps in knowledge of AMR, and patient engagement and involvement in AMS.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
677,34988545,"Using qualitative process evaluation in the development of a complex intervention to advance person-centred practice by pharmacists: The Medicines and Alcohol Consultation (MAC).  In order to effectively evaluate complex interventions, there have been calls for the further integration of qualitative methods. Qualitative process studies of brief alcohol interventions and medicines reviews are notably lacking. This article provides a grounded example through the presentation of findings from an embedded qualitative process evaluation of a multi-site, pilot cluster RCT of a new intervention: the Medicines and Alcohol Consultation (MAC). MAC is designed to increase the capacity of community pharmacists (CPs) to conduct person-centred medicines reviews in which the subject of alcohol consumption is raised in connection with medications and associated health conditions. Participant-focused qualitative studies (interviews, observations, recorded consultations) sought to understand how CPs engaged with and implemented MAC in context. This article documents effects of the intervention on developing person-centred consultation practice and highlights how qualitative process studies can be used formatively to develop middle range programme theory and to optimise intervention design for testing in a definitive RCT.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
678,34988876,"White Paper on the Value of Time Savings for Patients and Healthcare Providers of Breast Cancer Therapy: The Fixed-Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab for Subcutaneous Injection as an Example.  Health technology assessments and value frameworks are becoming increasingly important for clinical decision-making. Most of these frameworks, however, focus on value to payers rather than patients and healthcare providers and may ignore other sources of economic value such as patient and physician time cost, impact on productivity, and direct health system costs. This article focusses on fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We review relevant clinical evidence, examine data on time and resource use of the subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab compared with intravenous treatment and how it can be extrapolated to PH FDC SC, and discuss the value PH FDC SC can bring to patients and healthcare providers. We will also provide our own experiences of PH FDC SC from the healthcare (oncologist, healthcare economist, pharmacist) and patient point of view. The data, combined with our personal experiences, suggest that switching from intravenous pertuzumab and trastuzumab to PH FDC SC could reduce non-drug costs for healthcare providers treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancer through time savings and other economic benefits. Furthermore, PH FDC SC could also save patient time given its shorter administration and post-injection observation time versus intravenous infusions, potentially resulting in reduced productivity loss. These benefits could be applied to other subcutaneous formulations, either currently available or in development.  New therapies are increasingly assessed by looking at their value to those who pay for them rather than their value to patients and healthcare providers. Value assessments conducted from the payers’ perspective often ignore such things as patient and healthcare system time and costs. The fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (also known as pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf, abbreviated to PH FDC SC), is injected under the skin to treat a subtype of breast cancer called HER2-positive breast cancer. PH FDC SC is as effective as pertuzumab and trastuzumab, which are infused separately into a vein, but takes a lot less time to administer to patients. This transition is similar to what was seen when a subcutaneous version of trastuzumab was developed and compared to the intravenous original. Also, subcutaneous trastuzumab reduced costs associated with treating patients compared with intravenous infusions. The same benefits of PH FDC SC to patients and healthcare providers can be expected, and our personal experiences as an oncologist, healthcare economist, patient, and pharmacist agree. PH FDC SC could save patient and healthcare provider time given its shorter injection and observation times versus intravenous infusions, potentially resulting in better productivity for these people and a smaller cost to healthcare providers. These benefits could be applied to other subcutaneous formulations, either currently available or in development.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
679,34990287,"Ethanol Exposure During the Intravenous Administration of Chemotherapeutic Drugs: An Analysis of Clinical Practice and a Literature Review. PURPOSE Injectable cytotoxics may be formulated with ethanol. This study sought to quantify the amount of ethanol exposure during chemotherapy infusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS We first reviewed the antineoplastic drugs (Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical code L01) and oncologic supportive care drugs (eg, antiemetics) currently available in France, to identify preparations containing ethanol. The amount of ethanol in the final chemotherapy preparation was calculated. Next, we performed a 2-year, single-center, retrospective analysis of injectable antineoplastic drug compounding in routine clinical practice in a French university medical center. Finally, we reviewed our results with regard to the literature data. RESULTS Ten of the 60 cytotoxic products on the market contained ethanol at concentrations of up to 790 mg/mL, depending on the drug, formulation, and supplier. Several final preparations contained more than 3 g of ethanol per infusion (the maximum recommended by the European Medicines Agency); this was notably the case for gemcitabine, paclitaxel (up to 20 g ethanol per injection, for both), and etoposide (up to 50 g ethanol per infusion). The analysis of our compounding activity showed that 3,172 (4.99%) of the 63,613 chemotherapy preparations (notably paclitaxel) contained more than 3 g of ethanol. None of the oncologic supportive care drugs contained ethanol. CONCLUSION Patients are exposed to ethanol during the infusion of antineoplastic drugs. With a view to better patient care, physicians and pharmacists should carefully evaluate the risk of ethanol exposure throughout the course of cytotoxic drug treatment.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
680,34990507,"The potential for leveraging machine learning to filter medication alerts. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the potential for machine learning to predict medication alerts that might be ignored by a user, and intelligently filter out those alerts from the user's view. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified features (eg, patient and provider characteristics) proposed to modulate user responses to medication alerts through the literature; these features were then refined through expert review. Models were developed using rule-based and machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and LightGBM). We collected log data on alerts shown to users throughout 2019 at University of Utah Health. We sought to maximize precision while maintaining a false-negative rate <0.01, a threshold predefined through discussion with physicians and pharmacists. We developed models while maintaining a sensitivity of 0.99. Two null hypotheses were developed: H1-there is no difference in precision among prediction models; and H2-the removal of any feature category does not change precision. RESULTS A total of 3,481,634 medication alerts with 751 features were evaluated. With sensitivity fixed at 0.99, LightGBM achieved the highest precision of 0.192 and less than 0.01 for the pre-defined maximal false-negative rate by subject-matter experts (H1) (P < 0.001). This model could reduce alert volume by 54.1%. We removed different combinations of features (H2) and found that not all features significantly contributed to precision. Removing medication order features (eg, dosage) most significantly decreased precision (-0.147, P = 0.001).

682,34991616,"A review of the continuous professional development system for pharmacists. BACKGROUND The Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society (PPS) implemented a system of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for pharmacists in 2004. This system has evolved throughout the years, and currently all active pharmacists in Portugal are required to participate in the CPD program. Each CPD cycle takes 5 years. In each cycle, pharmacists must collect 15 CPD points, through participation in educational activities. The PPS accreditation process is managed via an online platform, where education/training providers, as well as pharmacists themselves, can submit educational activities for accreditation. Pharmacists may access their CPD status and assess their development at any point. The objective of this study was to analyze and review the educational activities submitted by providers over a 11-year period (2009-2019). METHODS Data from activities were retrieved from the PPS CPD online platform. All educational activities were labeled according to the area of pharmaceutical professional focus, type of promoter, and activity type. RESULTS During the study 3685 activities were analyzed. Over the last decade, submitted activities for accreditation increased in 52.6%. A significantly high proportion (98.9%) of these activities has been accredited. Promoters of activities were mostly pharmacies sectoral associations (29.6%), consultancy/training companies (19.6%), the PPS (18.5%), pharmaceutical industry (17.7%) and wholesalers' consortia (9.0%). Academia represented only 2.3% of the total amount of educational activities. The most frequent topics were related to ""pharmacology & pharmacotherapy"" (9.9%), followed by ""counselling"" (9.8%) and ""management & administration"" (7.2%). The most accredited type of activities was face-to-face (68.9%) and e-learning trainings (13.1%).

683,34991950,"Experiences of stigma in hospitals with addiction consultation services: A qualitative analysis of patients' and hospital-based providers' perspectives. BACKGROUND Addiction consultation services (ACS) provide evidence-based treatment to hospitalized patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Expansion of hospital-based addiction care may help to counteract the stigma that patients with SUD experience within the health care system. Stigma is among the most impactful barriers to seeking care and adhering to medical advice among people with SUD. We aimed to understand how the presence of an ACS affected patients' and hospital-based providers' experiences with stigma in the hospital setting. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study utilizing focus groups and key informant interviews with hospital-based providers (hospitalists and hospital-based nurses, social workers, pharmacists). We also conducted key informant interviews with patients who received care from an ACS during their hospitalization. An interprofessional team coded and analyzed transcripts using a thematic analysis approach to identify emergent themes. RESULTS Sixty-two hospital-based providers participated in six focus groups or eight interviews. Twenty patients participated in interviews. Four themes emerged relating to the experiences of stigma reported by hospital-based providers and hospitalized patients with SUD: (1) past experiences in the health care system propagate a cycle of stigmatization between hospital-based providers and patients; (2) documentation in medical charts unintentionally or intentionally perpetuates enacted stigma among hospital-based providers resulting in anticipated stigma among patients; (3) the presence of an ACS reduces enacted stigma among hospital-based providers through expanding the use of evidenced-based SUD treatment and reframing the SUD narrative; (4) ACS team members combat the effects of internalized stigma by promoting feelings of self-worth, self-efficacy, and mutual respect among patients with SUD. CONCLUSIONS An ACS can facilitate destigmatization of hospitalized patients with SUD by incorporating evidence-based SUD treatment into routine hospital care, by providing and modeling compassionate care, and by reframing addiction as a chronic condition to be treated alongside other medical conditions. Future reductions of stigma in hospital settings may result from promoting greater use of evidence-based treatment for SUD and expanded education for health care providers on the use of non-stigmatizing language and medical terminology when documenting SUD in the medical chart.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
684,34991981,"Impact of a pharmacist-run refill and prior authorization program on physician workload. BACKGROUND Pharmacist-led programs centralizing prescription renewals and prior authorization processing have been implemented within health care systems; however, their impact on physician efficiency and the perception of impact on workload are unknown. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to measure the change in physician efficiency score after implementation of the refill and prior authorization pilot program (RPAPP). Secondary objectives included changes in physician and staff perception of workload, changes in Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Star Measures, and program productivity. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study comparing patient and physician data 12 months before and after RPAPP implementation at an academic medical center. Physician efficiency was an average of 5 metrics that measure performance utilizing the electronic health record. Physician and staff perceptions were measured at baseline and 12 months via a pre- and postsurvey. Changes in CMS Star Measures were captured using the institution's Population Health Department data. RPAPP productivity was defined as the number of refills/prior authorizations processed and laboratory parameters ordered. RESULTS On implementation, positive results were seen in average physician efficiency scores for 1 of 2 clinics (P < 0.05). Survey results indicated significantly positive changes in physician and staff perception of workload and satisfaction. The RPAPP appeared to help improve institutional performance for 2 of the 3 CMS Star measures evaluated (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Evaluation of primary care physician workload is complex.

The purpose of the study was to observe the prevalence of impostor phenomenon (IP) among students attending Ohio Northern University, and assess secondary factors that impact the severity of IP.Method. Using the validated Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale the incidence of IP was assessed at Ohio Northern University (ONU). The investigators hypothesized that students enrolled in the College of Pharmacy would demonstrate more intense levels of IP than students enrolled in other majors within the University.Results. 391 students of the approximately 3100 students (12.6%) completed the survey and qualified for the study. Students for this study were recruited via email. This method was utilized for two reasons; it was the best way to reach the entirety of the student body and at this time, students were transitioning from campus to home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of a total possible score of 100, all colleges scored an average IP score between 68 and 75. These scores are interpreted as ""frequently experiences impostor feelings."" No statistical significance in scores was found by college, gender, ethnicity/race, year in school, or specific major.Conclusion. Impostor phenomenon is common at Ohio Northern University and does not discriminate by college, age, gender, race/ethnicity, year in school, or academic major.

688,34992529,"Ethnopharmacological Survey of Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy Prescriptions for Dysmenorrhea.  Chinese herbal medicines have long been used for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. The treatment experiences of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacies passed down through generations have contributed to a wealth of prescriptions for dysmenorrhea that have achieved significant therapeutic effects in countless Taiwanese women. Therefore, surveying and analyzing these prescriptions may enable us to elucidate the core medication combinations used in TCM prescriptions for dysmenorrhea. In the present study, a field investigation was conducted on various TCM pharmacies in Taiwan. A total of 96 TCM pharmacies were sampled, and 99 prescriptions for dysmenorrhea containing 77 different medicinal materials were collected. Compositae (8%) was the most common botanical source of the medicinal materials, and the predominant TCM property and flavor of the materials were warm (45%) and sweet (73%), respectively. The blood-activating and stasis-dispelling effect (23%) and the qi-tonifying effect (23%) were the most prevalent traditional effects, and the modern pharmacological effects most commonly found in the materials were anti-inflammatory (73%), antitumor (59%), and analgesic (12%) effects. Network analysis of the 77 medicinal materials used in the prescriptions, which was performed using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Support System, yielded seven core medicinal materials and the corresponding network diagram. The seven core medicinal materials ranked in order of relative frequency of citation (RFC) were Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)

690,34994312,"Pharmacy and Exercise as Complimentary Partners for Successful Cardiovascular Ageing.  Diseases of the cardiovascular system have been the biggest cause of mortality for the majority of the last century, currently contributing to almost a third of deaths every year globally. Ageing associates with changes to the structure and function of the heart and vascular system that progressively increase the incidence of abnormalities, morbidity, and cardiovascular disease. The burden of ageing and its relationship to cardiovascular disease risk highlights the need for more research into the underlying mechanisms involved and how they may be treated and/or prevented. Factors influencing adrenergic dysfunction may explain a significant part of the age-related deterioration in health and responsiveness of the cardiovascular system. Increased sympathetic activity in old age overstimulates adrenergic receptors and causes detrimental changes within the associated signalling mechanisms including a reduction in receptor number and downstream effector efficiency. Pharmacological agents such as metformin, resveratrol, beta-blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been identified as potential anti-ageing therapies with cardiovascular effects, which may be beneficial in treating the decline in cardiovascular function with old age. Regular exercise has also shown promise in the prevention and treatment of harmful age-related effects on the cardiovascular system. This review will investigate age-associated vascular and cardiac remodelling, and the link between adrenergic dysfunction and vascular and cardiac control. This review will also consider whether pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies are most effective, or indeed complimentary to potentially optimise ageing of the cardiovascular system and improve quality of life in the elderly.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

693,34995148,"A Comprehensive Understanding of the Use of e-Learning in Continuing Education: Experiences of Pharmacists in a Public Health System. INTRODUCTION The health and education sectors have experienced rapid technological development. In this scenario, the use of Internet technology has grown as an option for the expansion of continuing education (CE), as it allows professionals to develop educational activities with flexibility, autonomy, and convenience. E-learning has gained popularity and currently, thousands of online courses are being offered. However, studies of e-learning in professional training have presented only a few specific foci of study. OBJECTIVE to develop a comprehensive approach to understand both the experience and the complex scenario of the use of e-learning in the CE for pharmacists. METHOD Field research in 10 Brazilian states through interviews and focus groups with alumni of a CE e-learning specialization course for pharmacists in public health. Data analysis used the model of socio-technical systems and was based on a framework with the components Objectives, People, Processes, Culture, Technology, Infrastructure, and Scenario. RESULTS The People and Culture components indicated the assimilation and normalization of technologies in the educational process. Although the infrastructure (technical and organizational) was deficient in some regions, the Technology component suggested that the characteristics of the course design, associated with the personal characteristics of the students, provided ways to overcome obstacles. The objectives of the use of distance education seem to be related to the possibility of greater accessibility and autonomy. The Processes component, in turn, revealed the burden that a e-learning course puts on the pharmacist. CONCLUSION E-learning proved to be useful to enable and expand access to education, providing pharmacists with an opportunity for CE. On the other hand, e-learning contributes to the normalization of the precarious working conditions of pharmacists, attributing to individuals the sole responsibility for the CE even in an institutional CE program, which results in work overload.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

695,34996412,"Preemptive pharmacogenetic testing to guide chemotherapy dosing in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies: a qualitative study of barriers to implementation. BACKGROUND Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for germline variants in the DPYD and UGT1A1 genes can be used to guide fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan dosing, respectively. Despite the known association between PGx variants and chemotherapy toxicity, preemptive testing prior to chemotherapy initiation is rarely performed in routine practice. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study of oncology clinicians to identify barriers to using preemptive PGx testing to guide chemotherapy dosing in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Each participant completed a semi-structured interview informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Interviews were analyzed using an inductive content analysis approach. RESULTS Participants included sixteen medical oncologists and nine oncology pharmacists from one academic medical center and two community hospitals in Pennsylvania. Barriers to the use of preemptive PGx testing to guide chemotherapy dosing mapped to four CFIR domains: intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, and characteristics of individuals. The most prominent themes included 1) a limited evidence base, 2) a cumbersome and lengthy testing process, and 3) a lack of insurance coverage for preemptive PGx testing. Additional barriers included clinician lack of knowledge, difficulty remembering to order PGx testing for eligible patients, challenges with PGx test interpretation, a questionable impact of preemptive PGx testing on clinical care, and a lack of alternative therapeutic options for some patients found to have actionable PGx variants. CONCLUSIONS Successful adoption of preemptive PGx-guided chemotherapy dosing in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies will require a multifaceted effort to demonstrate clinical effectiveness while addressing the contextual factors identified in this study.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
696,34996466,"A qualitative study on pharmacy policies toward over-the-counter syringe sales in a rural epicenter of US drug-related epidemics. BACKGROUND Expanding access to sterile syringes in rural areas is vital, as injection-related epidemics expand beyond metropolitan areas globally. While pharmacies have potential to be an easily accessible source of sterile syringes, research in cities has identified moral, legal and ethical barriers that preclude over-the-counter (OTC) sales to people who inject drugs (PWID). The current study builds on prior urban-based research by elucidating (1) pharmacy OTC policies and (2) pharmacists' rationale for, and barriers and facilitators to, OTC syringe sales in a US rural area hard hit by drug-related epidemics. METHODS We conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with pharmacists recruited from two Eastern Kentucky health districts. Interview domains included experiences with, and attitudes toward, selling OTC syringes to PWID. Constructivist grounded theory methods were used to analyze verbatim transcripts. RESULTS Most pharmacists operated ""restrictive OTC"" pharmacies (n = 8), where patients were required to have a prescription or proof of medical need to purchase a syringe. The remainder (n = 6) operated ""open OTC"" pharmacies, which allowed OTC syringe sales to most patients. Both groups believed their pharmacy policies protected their community and pharmacy from further drug-related harm, but diverging policies emerged because of stigma toward PWID, perceptions of Kentucky law, and belief OTC syringe sales were harmful rather than protective to the community. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that restrictive OTC pharmacy policies are rooted in stigmatizing views of PWID. Anti-stigma education about substance use disorder (SUD), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Hepatitis C (HCV) is likely needed to truly shift restrictive pharmacy policy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
697,34996577,"Patient experiences with pharmacist prescribed hormonal contraception in California independent and chain pharmacies. BACKGROUND Pharmacist contraception care is an innovative practice that is rapidly expanding with policy changes. There is limited literature describing patient experiences with this pharmacist service. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to describe patient experiences using pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception in California pharmacies. METHODS An online survey was conducted among a cross-sectional convenience sample of people of all ages who completed a contraception visit with a pharmacist from December 2017 to January 2019 at a participating independent or chain pharmacy in California. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data on patient characteristics, experiences and satisfaction with the service, and preventive health screenings. RESULTS A total of 160 individuals completed the survey and nearly all were adults (97%) and had started or completed postsecondary education (85%). Most (72%) visited the pharmacy to get a prescription for a contraceptive method they were already using. The most common method prescribed was the pill (90%). The most common reason for seeking a prescription at a pharmacy was because it would be faster than waiting for a doctor's appointment (74%), followed by the location and hours being more convenient (46% and 41%), saving money (28%), and not having a regular doctor (26%). Respondents reported satisfaction with the services overall (97%), level of comfort they felt with the pharmacist (94%), counseling provided (86%), and level of privacy (74%). Nearly all were likely to return to a pharmacist for contraception (96%) and recommend the service to a friend (95%). CONCLUSION Pharmacist prescribing of contraception in community pharmacies provided a convenient access point that was highly acceptable to patients who used it. One area for attention is in the level of privacy during contraception visits. These findings support the effectiveness of direct pharmacy access to contraception and encourage pharmacist contraception prescribing policies and widespread implementation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe and compare the public's change in awareness and perceptions of, willingness to use, willingness to pay, and interest in insurance coverage for community pharmacist prescriptive authority services and point of care testing over a time span of 14 years. METHODS This was a retrospective review of anonymous questionnaires administered by student pharmacists in 2004 and in 2018. Questionnaires were administered to individuals who presented to University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy sponsored health fair screenings and at various community pharmacies throughout the state of New Mexico (NM). RESULTS In total, 545 (2004) and 659 (2017-2018) participants completed the questionnaire. Awareness of community pharmacist clinical services increased from 2004 to 2018. In 2018, awareness of newer prescriptive authority services provided by pharmacists in NM was low relative to the services assessed in previous years. Most respondents indicated a willingness to use and pay for pharmacist-provided clinical services and felt that pharmacists should receive compensation by their insurance for these services. Trust in pharmacist advice grew from 2004 to 2018. CONCLUSION Overall rates of awareness of community pharmacist clinical services were low with the exception of immunizations; however, most participants indicated interest in and willingness to use these services. Most participants believed pharmacists should receive reimbursement from insurance companies for clinical services and were also willing to pay a copay or out-of-pocket cost for these services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

700,34996787,"Concerns and desires of healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 in April and July 2020 in Japan: a qualitative study of open-ended survey comments. OBJECTIVES The prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to have a serious impact on healthcare workers. We described and compared the experiences of healthcare workers in Japan during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from March to May 2020, and during the lull from June to July 2020. DESIGN In this qualitative study, we used a web-based survey to obtain comments from healthcare workers about their experiences during the pandemic, and explored these using inductive content analysis. SETTING A tertiary emergency hospital in Tokyo, in April and July 2020. PARTICIPANTS Participants were staff in the hospital, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, radiological technicians and laboratory medical technicians. Many, but not all, had directly cared for patients with COVID-19. RESULTS In total, 102 participants in the first survey and 154 in the second survey provided open-ended comments. Three themes were extracted: concerns, requests and gratitude. There were four subthemes under concerns: the hospital infection control system, fear of spreading infection to others, uncertainty about when the pandemic would end and being treated as a source of infection. There were 53 requests in the first survey and 106 in the second survey. These requests were divided into seven subthemes: compensation, staffing, information, facilities, leave time, PCR tests and equitable treatment. The theme on gratitude had two subthemes: information and emotional support, and material support. The fears and desires of healthcare workers included two types of uncertainty-related concerns, and requests were very different across the two surveys. CONCLUSIONS It is important to apply a balance of information to help staff adjust to their new work environment, as well as support to minimise the burden of infection and impact on their families.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
701,34997667,"Osteoarthritis management: Does the pharmacist play a role in bridging the gap between what patients actually know and what they ought to know? Insights from a national online survey. BACKGROUND Guidelines encourage engagement in self-care activities for osteoarthritis (OA), but there are gaps in consumers' knowledge about suitable choices for self-care. Community pharmacists are in an ideal position to contribute to OA management through screening and supporting evidence-based pain management choices. Prior research established an association between health literacy and advice-seeking and appropriateness of analgesics choices (both lower in participants with limited health literacy) amongst people living with OA. This article explores the implications of these data for pharmacists in OA management. METHODS A national online survey was conducted amongst 628 adults aged 45-74 years, currently residing in Australia, with self-reported symptoms of OA. All data were collected using a customized online questionnaire, which was completed only once. 'Self-reported symptoms of OA' was based on six validated screening questions to identify people with OA without a formal clinical diagnosis. RESULTS Respondents matched the typical profile of people diagnosed with OA; more than half were female (56%), knees (59%) and hips (31%) were the primary affected joints and 74% were either overweight or obese. Self-identification of OA was limited (41%). Overall, 38% self-managed their pain, and limited health literacy was associated with less advice-seeking. Efficacy and ease of use were the main reasons cited for prompting use across all classes of nonprescription analgesic, with less than 20% reporting recommendation from a pharmacist. Participants were managing their pain with an average of 1.74 (95% confidence interval: 1.60-1.88) analgesics, but 73% reported inadequate pain relief and 54% had disrupted sleep. CONCLUSION Our findings highlight three key themes: lack of self-identification of OA, suboptimal pain relief and limited use of the community pharmacist as a source of management advice. Equipping community pharmacists with tools to identify OA could bridge this gap. More research is needed to determine if it will improve consumers' ability to appropriately manage OA pain. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION Consumers living with OA contributed to the study outcomes, reviewed the survey questionnaire for face validity and advised on plain language terminology.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
702,34998246,"Limited access to pharmacy-based naloxone in West Virginia: Results from a statewide purchase trial. BACKGROUND West Virginia (WV) has the highest overdose mortality rate in the United States and expanding naloxone access is crucial for reducing opioid overdose deaths. We conducted a purchase trial to establish an objective measure of naloxone access under WV's naloxone standing order (NSO) program. METHODS A stratified random sample of 200 chain and independent retail pharmacies across WV were included. Each pharmacy underwent two purchase attempts-one by a person who used illicit opioids (PWUIO) and one by a potential bystander who did not use illicit opioids but had a relationship with a PWUIO. We used matched-pairs analysis to identify differences in outcomes by purchaser type (PWUIO vs bystander). Chi-square and independent-samples t-tests were used to compare outcomes by pharmacy type (chain vs independent). RESULTS Overall, 29% of purchase attempts were successful, with no significant difference between PWUIO and bystanders (p = 0.798). Fewer than half (44%) of successful purchases included verbal counseling, and bystanders were more likely to receive counseling than PWUIO (33% vs 4%, p = 0.018). Common reasons for failed purchases were naloxone not being in stock (41%), requiring a naloxone prescription (35%), and/or requiring formal identification (23%). Chain pharmacies were more likely to sell naloxone than independents (35% vs 19%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS We documented limited naloxone access under the WV NSO. These findings indicate that simply establishing an NSO program is insufficient to expand access. Implementation efforts should ensure adequate naloxone stocks, pro-active delivery of NSO-related information and pharmacist training, and avoidance of recordkeeping requirements that may impede access.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
703,34998277,"Assessing community pharmacists' attitudes towards identifying opportunities for deprescribing in clinical practice in Ireland. OBJECTIVES The main objective of this study was to assess community pharmacists' thoughts regarding the role they can play in effectively integrating deprescribing into clinical practice in Ireland. The aim was to assess pharmacists' (1) knowledge of deprescribing, (2) confidence in deprescribing, (3) attitudes towards deprescribing and (iv) barriers and facilitators to deprescribing in a community pharmacy setting. METHODS An online questionnaire was disseminated to pharmacists currently registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, with instruction only to complete if working in community pharmacy. Statistical analysis was conducted on the quantitative data, whereas thematic analysis was carried out on the open-ended responses. KEY FINDINGS Results indicate good knowledge scores and positive attitudes surrounding deprescribing, with demographic factors having no significant effect on results. Although deprescribing knowledge is high, willingness to engage is hindered by obstacles such as time. Remuneration was identified as an enabler for deprescribing. Interdisciplinary educational opportunities and bidirectional communication channels with prescribers are viewed as the major facilitators of deprescribing. CONCLUSIONS Community pharmacists demonstrate that they possess sufficient knowledge, confidence and willingness to play a greater role in facilitating deprescribing. To enable this role expansion, enablers such as education and funding need to be implemented, to overcome barriers such as insufficient time. Further studies are required to assess community pharmacists' deprescribing competence, to demonstrate their ability to fulfil this role in clinical practice in Ireland.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Policy mechanisms shaping population health take numerous forms, from behavioral prohibitions to mandates for action to surveillance. Rising drug overdoses undermined the state's ability to promote population-level health. Using the case of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), we contend that PDMP implementation highlights state biopower operating via mechanisms of surveillance, whereby prescribers, pharmacists, and patients perceive agency despite choices being constrained. We consider whether such surveillance mechanisms are sufficient or if prescriber/dispenser access or requirements for use are necessary for population health impact. We test whether PDMPs reduced overdose mortality while considering that surveillance may require time to reach effectiveness. PDMPs reduced opioid overdose mortality 2 years postimplementation and sustained effects, with similar effects for prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and psychostimulants. Access or mandates for action do not reduce mortality beyond surveillance. Overall, PDMP effects on overdose mortality are likely due to self-regulation under surveillance rather than mandated action.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Purpose Intern assessment during advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) are generally based upon each individual preceptor's perceptions without an objective measurement of intern understanding and performance. Therefore, we sought to determine whether a pre- and post-OSCE could be used to confirm that interns achieved the goals and objectives of the Ambulatory Care rotation. The aims of this study were to determine whether a pre-rotation OSCE can help pharmacy interns self-assess their clinical strengths and weaknesses and assess whether their knowledge and skills improved after completing a post-rotation OSCE. Methods Pharmacy interns undergoing APPE Ambulatory Care rotations from September 2018 to March 2020 participated in a pre- and post-rotation OSCE to assess their knowledge of various chronic disease states. Interns completed pre- and post-OSCE surveys to assess their perceptions about their knowledge and the OSCE experience. Results Pharmacy intern knowledge about diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation significantly improved post-OSCE compared to their pre-OSCE scores (p < 0.001).

Conclusion Pre- and post-APPE OSCE assessments are important tools that can provide interns and preceptors with objective evaluations of student performance. OSCEs can either be used as an alternative to perception-based assessments or integrated into existing preceptor evaluations. Furthermore, OSCEs can help preceptors identify areas that require more emphasis in their rotations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
714,35002382,"The ethical challenges in pharmacy practice in community Pharmacies: A qualitative study. Background Pharmacists as a group of health care professionals, face different types of ethical challenges in their everyday routine that may impede pharmaceutical care. Objectives In this study, we aimed at evaluation and recognition of the ethical challenges of pharmacy practice in community pharmacies. Methods This exploratory study was conducted as a qualitative study consisting of open-ended in-depth interviews and focus group discussions followed by content analysis. The study participants were chosen from pharmacists with PharmD degree who had at least 4 years work experience and were the founders or technical managers of community pharmacies, either as governmental or private. Interviews continued until data saturation and transcribed verbatim. The content analysis was done by Graneheim and Lundman method. The codes were generated, and categorized. After assessment and final modifications, the results of the study were discussed and confirmed in a focus group discussion conducted by 7 experts who teach medical ethics and/or pharmacy ethics. Results Overall, 40 pharmacists were interviewed (mean age 46 ± 11.3 years). The extracted ethical challenges of pharmacy practice were categorized into 3 main themes, 11 subthemes and 102 codes. The themes were achieved as challenges related to professionalism and professional practice, challenges related to professional communications and challenges related to regulations and policies. Conclusion Taken together, it seems that most of the challenges of pharmacy practice are related to professionalism and professional commitment; however, the regulations and policies provide serious obstacles for pharmacy practice and pharmaceutical care. More efforts towards teaching professionalism and modification of regulations and policies are recommended.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
715,35002387,"Status of infectious disease content in the professional pharmacy curriculum in Saudi Arabia: Results of a national survey. Objectives Antimicrobial resistance is one of the main global problems faced by healthcare institutions. Healthcare professionals as service providers must have a basic understanding of this emerging threat; additionally, considering the evolving role of pharmacists in both the community and hospital setting, it is crucial that pharmacists are part of the fight against this threat. Therefore, this study aimed to assess infectious disease subjects covered in the pharmacy curriculum in Saudi Arabia, to evaluate teaching and knowledge assessment strategies concerning infectious diseases, and to explore challenges faced by faculty members in teaching infectious disease courses. Methods We constructed a questionnaire with 26 items and sent it to infectious disease faculty members at 26 Saudi Arabian pharmacy colleges. It included questions regarding the faculty and institution, infectious disease topics, hours dedicated to each topic, and tools and strategies used in the courses for better understanding and assessment of students. In addition, we enquired about the faculty members' current satisfaction of, and future plans for, the curriculum. Results The questionnaire was completed by infectious disease faculty members, department chairs, or college deans. Among the respondent schools, 85.5% were governmental and 14.5% were private institutions. The majority of colleges (98.2%) followed a semester format schedule, with 67.3% offering solely the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program. More than 78% of respondents covered all tier 1 infectious disease topics from the American College of Clinical Pharmacy Pharmacotherapy Didactic Curriculum Toolkit. The main tool used for teaching was lectures (94.5%), while patient case application was the main teaching strategy (54.5%). Approximately 63% of respondents thought that the curricula were adequate when they were asked about their opinion of the curricula coverage, and 63.64% thought that the curriculum provided adequate baseline knowledge on infectious diseases for the following 5 years. Conclusions The study revealed variations in infectious disease topics covered and the time dedicated to them among pharmacy colleges in Saudi Arabia. The faculty members who responded to our questionnaire were generally satisfied with their infectious disease curriculum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess infectious disease curricula among Saudi pharmacy colleges. Thus, the findings of this study may encourage faculty members to advocate for the standardization of infectious disease courses offered at Saudi Arabian pharmacy colleges.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
716,35002555,"Strategies for Implementing Pediatric Dose Standardization: Considerations From the Vizient University Health System Consortium Pharmacy Network Pediatric Pharmacy Committee.  Pediatric patients are at a heightened risk for medication errors due to variability in medication ordering and administration. Dose rounding and standardization have been 2 practices historically used to reduce variability and improve medication safety. This article will describe strategies for implementing pediatric dose standardization. Local practice often dictates the operational decisions made at an institutional level, leading to a lack of a standard methodology. Vizient survey results demonstrate there is wide variation in dose standardization and ready-to-use (RTU) practices although most responding institutions have attempted to limit bedside manipulation to reduce medication error. There are many barriers to consider before pursuing dose standardization at an institution. These include selecting medications to standardize, calculating appropriate standardized doses, preparing RTU products, and supplying the products to the patient. Strategies to overcome implementation issues are described as well as identification of knowledge gaps related to the preparation and use of RTU products in the pediatric population. There is opportunity to enhance an institution's ability to provide RTU medications. Although there are several barriers, those that have had successful implementation have leveraged their information technology systems, garnered multidisciplinary support, and customized their practice to meet their operational demands.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
717,35002706,"Respiratory Adherence Care Enhancer Questionnaire: Identifying Self-Management Barriers of Inhalation Corticosteroids in Asthma.  Introduction: Suboptimal self-management of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in asthma patients is frequently observed in clinical practice and associated with poor asthma control. Driving factors for suboptimal self-management are complex and consist of a range of behavioral barriers (cognitive, affective and practical) with a considerable inter-individual variability. Identification of individual barriers facilitates the use of corresponding behavior change techniques and tailored care to improve asthma treatment outcomes. Objective: This study describes the development and validation of the 'Respiratory Adherence Care Enhancer' (RACE) questionnaire to identify individual barriers to self-management of ICS therapy in asthma patients. Methods: The development included: 1) an inventory of self-management barriers based on a literature review, 2) expert assessment on relevance and completeness of this set, linking these barriers to behavioral domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and 3) the formulation of corresponding questions assessing each of the barriers. A cross-sectional study was performed for validation. Primary care asthma patients were invited to fill out the RACE-questionnaire prior to a semi-structured telephonic interview as golden standard. Barriers detected from the questionnaire were compared to those mentioned in the interview. Results: The developed questionnaire is made up of 6 TDF-domains, covering 10 self-management barriers with 23 questions. For the validation 64 patients completed the questionnaire, of whom 61 patients were interviewed. Cronbach's alpha for the consistency of questions within the barriers ranged from 0.58 to 0.90. Optimal cut-off values for the presence of barriers were determined at a specificity between 67 and 92% with a sensitivity between 41 and 83%. Significant Areas Under the Receiver Operating Curves values were observed for 9 barriers with values between 0.69 and 0.86 (p-value <0.05), except for 'Knowledge of ICS medication' with an insignificant value of 0.53. Conclusion: The RACE-questionnaire yields adequate psychometric characteristics to identify individual barriers to self-management of ICS therapy in asthma patients, facilitating tailored care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
718,35002744,"Household Drug Stockpiling and Panic Buying of Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study From Jordan.  The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) has affected health, societies and economies. Policies that have been imposed by different countries to slow the spread of the disease, including national lockdowns, curfews, border closures and enforcement of social distancing measures have disturbed the drug supply chain and resulted in drug shortages. Uncertainty concerning the pandemic has also led to the panic buying of drugs and the stockpiling of drugs in households, which has amplified the problem. In this cross-sectional study, a self-developed questionnaire was distributed online in order to a) assess the practice of household drug stockpiling prior to the national lockdown in Jordan, b) investigate the factors affecting it and c) measure peoples' knowledge about the consequences of this behaviour. Results from this study show that drug purchasing was reported by 44.3% of the participants and was most common among participants from non-medical backgrounds (336, 75.7%) or those who have chronic diseases (261, 58.8%) and taking chronic supplements (282, 63.5%) regardless of their age, gender, living area or the possession of health insurance. Analgesics and antipyretics were the most frequently purchased drugs (225, 70.5%) and anticipation of their need was the most common reason for purchasing drugs (231, 52.0%). Buyers were also less aware, when compared to non-buyers, that panic buying and drug stockpiling may lead to drug shortages (204, 45.9% vs 325, 58.1%) and that this behaviour can pose a health hazard, especially to children (221, 47.5% vs 342, 61.2%). Our study shows that panic buying of drugs and household drug stockpiling were common in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic and this was related to participants' medical knowledge and educational backgrounds. Therefore, educating the general population regarding rational drug use is urgently needed. This is also a compelling case for the development of national guidelines for drug management that target the general population and healthcare personnel, especially pharmacists, to avoid drug shortages during crises.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

722,35010682,"Risk Indicators Improve the Prescription Quality of Drugs with Anticholinergic Properties in Nursing Homes. AIM The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a collaborative therapeutic optimization program on the rate of potentially inappropriate prescription of drugs with anticholinergic properties in nursing homes. METHODS Quasi-experimental study in 37 nursing homes in France. The intervention included the use of quality indicators for prescriptions combined with educational sessions and dedicated materials for nursing home staff (unlimited access to study material for staff, including nurses, general practitioners, pharmacists). Indicators were calculated based on routine data collected from an electronic pill dispenser system. The primary outcome was the presence of at least one prescription containing ≥1 drug from a list of 12 drugs with anticholinergic properties. A difference-in-differences analysis was conducted at 18 months as well as propensity score weighting to minimize any potential indication bias. A generalized estimating equation model estimated the probability of being prescribed at least one target drug at any time during a 9-month period for each resident. RESULTS In total, 33 nursing homes (intervention group: n = 10; control group: n = 23) were included, totalling 8137 residents. There was a decrease in the use of drugs with anticholinergic properties over time in both groups, as well as a decline in the intervention group compared to the control group (Odds Ratio: 0.685, 95% CI: 0.533, 0.880; p < 0.01) that was attributable to the intervention. An estimated 49 anticholinergic properties drug prescriptions were avoided by the intervention.

Integrating digital interventions in healthcare has gained increasing popularity among clinical pharmacists (CPs) due to advances in technology. The purpose of this study was to systematically review CP-led digital interventions to improve patients' health-related clinical outcomes. PubMed and the Cochrane Database were searched to select studies that had conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate clinical outcomes in adults following a CP-led digital intervention for the period from January 2005 to August 2021. A total of 19 studies were included in our analysis. In these 19 studies, the most commonly used digital intervention by CPs was telephone use (n = 15), followed by a web-based tool (n = 2) and a mobile app (n = 2). These interventions were provided to serve a wide range of purposes in patients' outcomes: change in lab values (e.g., blood pressure, HbA1c) (n = 23), reduction in health service use (n = 8), enhancing adherence (n = 6), improvement in drug-related outcomes (n = 6), increase in survival (n = 3), and reduction in health-related risk (e.g., CVD risk) (n = 2).

724,35011040,"Determination of the Awareness about and Need for Health Support Pharmacies as the Provider of Consultation Service about Nutrition Education and Diet-Related Health Promotion by Health Professionals in Japan.  Health support pharmacies (HSPs) have been established as a new category of pharmacies in Japan. In addition to prescriptions, HSPs provide several health services, including consultations on diet/nutrition, health foods, and nursing care. Therefore, not only individuals receiving medications but also community residents should have access to HSPs. However, it is unclear whether people are aware of HSPs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the awareness about HSPs and determine the need for their services. To this end, we conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey in 10,000 Japanese adults. Approximately 60.2% of the participants were aware of family pharmacies/pharmacists, and 21.8% of these participants had a family pharmacy/pharmacist. Meanwhile, 2.6% of the participants were aware of HSPs, while 9.2% of the participants had only heard of HSPs. Awareness of HSPs was higher among men and younger individuals than among women and older generations. In addition, only 7.2% of the participants were aware of the location of the HSP in their area of residence. At the time at which this survey was conducted, only 3.5% of the participants were using HSP services, and half of them did not perceive the merits of using these services. However, 44.4% of the participants wished to avail themselves of HSP services in the future, and this desire increased with age. Half of the participants wished to use services that were associated with drugs, and the need for other services, such as consultations on diet/nutrition or health foods, was low. In conclusion, there was low awareness about HSPs among the survey participants. However, from our findings, we gathered that if individuals are aware of HSPs, they will wish to use HSP services. To improve healthy life expectancy, it is important to increase awareness about HSPs and their number.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
725,35012478,"Control in the Hospital by Extensive Clinical rules for Unplanned hospitalizations in older Patients (CHECkUP); study design of a multicentre randomized study. BACKGROUND Due to ageing of the population the incidence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy is rising. Polypharmacy is a risk factor for medication-related (re)admission and therefore places a significant burden on the healthcare system. The reported incidence of medication-related (re)admissions varies widely due to the lack of a clear definition. Some medications are known to increase the risk for medication-related admission and are therefore published in the triggerlist of the Dutch guideline for Polypharmacy in older patients. Different interventions to support medication optimization have been studied to reduce medication-related (re)admissions. However, the optimal template of medication optimization is still unknown, which contributes to the large heterogeneity of their effect on hospital readmissions. Therefore, we implemented a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to optimize medication lists and investigate whether continuous use of a CDSS reduces the number of hospital readmissions in older patients, who previously have had an unplanned probably medication-related hospitalization. METHODS The CHECkUP study is a multicentre randomized study in older (≥60 years) patients with an unplanned hospitalization, polypharmacy (≥5 medications) and using at least two medications from the triggerlist, from Zuyderland Medical Centre and Maastricht University Medical Centre+ in the Netherlands. Patients will be randomized. The intervention consists of continuous (weekly) use of a CDSS, which generates a Medication Optimization Profile, which will be sent to the patient's general practitioner and pharmacist. The control group will receive standard care. The primary outcome is hospital readmission within 1 year after study inclusion. Secondary outcomes are one-year mortality, number of emergency department visits, nursing home admissions, time to hospital readmissions and we will evaluate the quality of life and socio-economic status. DISCUSSION This study is expected to add evidence on the knowledge of medication optimization and whether use of a continuous CDSS ameliorates the risk of adverse outcomes in older patients, already at an increased risk of medication-related (re)admission. To our knowledge, this is the first large study, providing one-year follow-up data and reporting not only on quality of care indicators, but also on quality-of-life.

AIM OF THE STUDY Serious adverse drug reactions account for 3.6% of French hospital admissions. Of these, 48.5% are, at least potentially, preventable. The first aim of post-marketing pharmacovigilance is to detect adverse drug reactions as a safety signal to improve patients' safety. Thus, this study describes the epidemiology of ""serious"" adverse drug reactions reported between 2015 and 2018 to a regional pharmacovigilance centre and assesses their economic burden. METHODS All ""serious"" adverse drug reactions reported to a regional pharmacovigilance centre during the four-year study period were collected and cost associated. Only congenital anomalies related to ""serious"" adverse drug reactions were excluded. RESULTS All 2585 ""serious"" adverse drug reactions reported are related to 1242 ""serious"" individual case safety reports. Among 58.1% of them, patients required hospital admission or a visit to the emergency room with a median cost estimated to €3725 per ""serious"" individual case safety report. The most ""serious"" adverse drug reactions reported involved gastrointestinal disorders. Fifteen percent of the imputed drugs had a narrow therapeutic index and the most frequently drug was fluindione. Finally, high relationships with an economic burden were observed for ages over or equal to 65, and imputed drugs from ""Blood and Blood-Forming Organs"" and ""Anti-infectives for systemic use"" therapeutic groups.

727,35012933,"Use of protocol-driven medication refills by pharmacists decreases rheumatologist in-basket work and improves rheumatologist satisfaction.  Burn-out among US physicians has been on the rise in the past few decades. Similarly, rheumatologists in the Geisinger Health System have experienced professional dissatisfaction through significant administrative burden and in-basket work. We embedded pharmacists into our rheumatology team in 2019 with the aim of reallocating medication refills to pharmacists, trained professionals in this domain, to help reduce physician workload and burn-out and increase satisfaction. Protocol-driven medication refill parameters per the American College of Rheumatology guidelines and new refill workflows for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and non-DMARDs were created for use by our rheumatology pharmacists. Monthly data on medication refill volume and time saved for rheumatologists were collected from 1 January 2019 to 31 March 2021. Statistical analysis was completed via Shewhart p-charts. The volume of refills by rheumatologists decreased by 73% and the time saved per month for all the rheumatologists increased to 41.5 hours within 6 months. Physicians' feedback was obtained via anonymous electronic surveys preintervention and postintervention.

There is debate regarding the necessity of graded readiness assurance tests (RATs) as incentive to complete pre-class preparation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of graded vs ungraded RATs on exam performance in an Ambulatory Care elective course for third year student pharmacists.Methods For the course offered in Spring 2020 and 2021, standard TBL framework was employed. RATs were graded in 2020 (graded RAT cohort), but did not contribute to overall course grade in 2021 (ungraded RAT cohort). An online anonymous survey of students determining class preparation and perceived team accountability was administered at course completion in the ungraded RAT cohort.Results. There was no significant difference between the graded RAT (n=47) and ungraded RAT cohorts (n=36) in overall mean percentage score on individual RATs (76% vs 74%) and individual exams (82 vs 80%). Most students (69-91%) in the ungraded RAT cohort reported completing pre-class preparation assignments. Ninety-four percent agreed or strongly agreed they contributed to team members' learning and 86% agreed or strongly agreed they were proud of their ability to assist in the team's learning.Conclusion. Ungraded RATs did not significantly impact student exam performance in an elective course. Removal of this assessment that promotes the performance-approach to learning may have contributed to a shift in motivation to the mastery-approach in the context of pre-class preparation.

729,35012944,"A Scoping Review of Suicide Prevention Training Programs for Pharmacists and Student Pharmacists.  Objective. This scoping review updates a 2018 review of suicide prevention (SP) training programs for community and student pharmacists. Five scholarly databases were searched for articles published between January 2018 and December 2020. Articles were excluded if they: 1) did not describe an educational or training program for pharmacists or student pharmacists; 2) did not explicitly include suicide; 3) focused solely on attitudes; or 4) did not provide sufficient detail to evaluate program content. The quality of each study was examined using a quality assessment tool.Findings. Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Most trainings (86%) were delivered live with interactive, or role play scenarios to promote verbal and behavioral skill practice. About half (57%) assessed changes in knowledge and fewer programs (29%) assessed changes in communication. All assessed the ability to identify suicide warning signs and included referral resources. Six studies were assessed for quality; 67% had a rating of good, and 33% were rated as fair.Summary. Given the increase in suicide rates nationally, it is likely that pharmacists will encounter a patient in need of suicide prevention services. Since 2018, seven new SP training programs for community and student pharmacists have been reported, which demonstrates growing interest in SP training in the pharmacy profession. When integrated in PharmD curricula, trainings may help prepare the pharmacy workforce for encounters with patients in crisis. The impact of training on self-efficacy and communication skills warrants additional attention. Variation between programs should be evaluated to understand which instructional methods best prepare pharmacy professionals to engage in suicide prevention.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Adverse drug events following inappropriate prescribing in the hospital cause a substantial and avoidable medical and economic burden to hospitals, payers and patients alike. A clinical rule-based, pharmacist-led medication-review service, the 'Check of Medication Appropriateness' (CMA) was implemented in the University Hospitals Leuven. The CMA is shown to be effective in reducing potentially inappropriate prescriptions. Aim This study investigated whether this centralised clinical pharmacy service is cost-effective. Method We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of three clinical rules of the CMA, targeting adverse drug events at three levels of severity: A) persistent opioid-induced constipation, B) ketorolac-induced gastrointestinal bleeding and C) drug-induced Torsade de Pointes. A decision tree was developed for each clinical rule. Both intervention costs as well as total costs associated with the occurrence of an adverse drug event were considered. The outcomes were reported in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as an incremental cost per adverse drug event avoided. Results Applying clinical rules to avoid persistent opioid-induced constipation and ketorolac-induced gastrointestinal bleeding were cost-saving. Implementation of a medication check to avoid drug-induced Torsade de Pointes costed €8,846 per Torsade de Pointes avoided. Conclusion Our study provides strong indications that the CMA is worth its investment for clinical rules targeting (very) common adverse drug events, that can be avoided with limited expenses.

732,35014073,"Feasibility of the MELD score as a screening tool for pharmacists to identify patients with impaired hepatic function at hospital admission. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Hepatic impairment (HI) is a known risk factor for drug safety. The MELD score (Model-for-endstage-liver-disease), calculated from serum creatinine, bilirubin and International Normalized Ratio (INR), is a promising screening tool corresponding to Child-Pugh Score (CPS) for drug adjustment. We tested the feasibility of MELD as an automatic screening tool accounting for correct calculation, interfering factors (IF) and detection of patients corresponding to CPS-B/C potentially requiring drug adjustment. METHODS We retrospectively calculated MELD for a 3-month cohort of surgical patients and assessed need for adjustment of MELD parameters to standard values. IF for INR (oral anticoagulants) and serum creatinine (renal insufficiency (RI; eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73m²); as well as drugs elevating creatinine levels (DECL)) and the number of patients with MELD scores corresponding to CPS-B/C were analysed. For MELD ≥7.5, liver and bile diagnoses were recorded. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Of 1183 patients, MELD was calculable for 761 (64%; median 7.5, range 6.4-36.8). Parameters had to be adjusted for 690 (91%) patients. IF of parameters were RI in 172 (23%), INR-elevating drugs in 105 (14%) and DECL in 33 (4%) patients. Of 335 (44%) patients with MELD ≥7.5, 122 (36%) had documented liver or bile diagnoses. MELD 10-<15 (corresponding to CPS-B) was found for 105 (14%), MELD ≥15 (corresponding to CPS-C) for 66 (9%) of the 761 patients with a calculated MELD. Referred to all patients, drug adjustments due to possible HI were recommendable for 14% of patients with suspected CPS-B/C. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION MELD is a feasible screening tool for HI as a risk factor for drug safety at hospital admission when appropriately considering correct parameter adjustment and RI and INR-elevating drugs as IF.

Using population-based administrative data (1996-2019) from British Columbia in Canada, we developed a method based on statistical modeling, (""REWarDS""), that involved fitting a random effects linear regression model to patients' cumulative dose over time, to estimate warfarin exposure. Model parameters included a minimal universally-available set of variables from prescription records to estimate patients' individualized average daily dose of warfarin. REWarDS estimates were validated against a reference standard (manual calculation of the daily dose using the free-text administration instructions entered by the dispensing pharmacist) and compared to alternative methods (fixed window, fixed tablet, Defined Daily Dose, and reverse Wait Time Distribution) using Pearson's correlation coefficient, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and Root Mean Squared Error. REWarDS-estimated days' supply showed strong correlation and agreement with the reference standard: Pearson's correlation coefficient =0.90 [95%CI:(0.90, 0.90); Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.95 [95%CI:(0.94, 0.95)]; Root Mean Squared Error = 8.24 days, and performed better than all the alternative methods. REWarDS estimated days' supply was valid and more accurate than all other available methods. REWarDS is expected to confer optimal precision in studies measuring warfarin exposure using administrative data.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

736,35016210,"New ways of working releasing general practitioner capacity with pharmacy prescribing support: a cost-consequence analysis. BACKGROUND General practice in the United Kingdom is experiencing a workforce crisis. Greater multidisciplinary working, including more general practice pharmacists, is seen as part of the solution. However, it is unknown what impact and cost-consequences that pharmacists may have in freeing general practitioner (GP) capacity. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-consequences of additional pharmacists in releasing GP capacity. METHODS This cost-consequences evaluation of a prospective observational cohort study in 15 urban practices involving 69 GPs in 1 locality serving a population of 82,000 people. GPs recorded the time they spent addressing key targeted prescribing activities during 5 distinct 2-week audit periods. Pharmacists performed these key prescribing activities to release GP capacity. An additional 225 h of pharmacists' time per week was committed to the locality. Standardized staff costings were used to estimate the financial impact. Prescribing indicator performance was assessed against the other 7 localities within the health board. RESULTS When compared with employing extra nonsalaried GPs this required an estimated additional investment of £16.73 (range £5.97-20.87) per h to free GP capacity. This achieved a sustainable 47% (73 h per week, F(4,56) = 16.05, P < 0.001) reduction in GP time spent on key prescribing activities; equating to 4.9 h (95% confidence interval 3.1-6.7) per practice per week. No significant step changes in locality safety and quality prescribing measures, and no negative effects on locality-level prescribing cost-efficiency work were observed. CONCLUSION Appropriately resourced general practice pharmacy teams delivered prescribing cost-efficiencies as well as sustainably freeing GP capacity by performing key prescribing activities.",1,1,0,0,1,Cost analysis was based on actual salary data and quality measures were included.,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,

738,35016847,"Integration of community pharmacy in primary health care: The challenge.  Community pharmacies and pharmacists predominantly operate in a retail environment independently of other health care providers, and they are not often viewed as an integral member of the healthcare team. Thus, they remain overlooked or excluded during integration processes of health care systems. At the same time, there are calls by the profession at national and international levels for community pharmacy to be integrated within primary care systems. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have further stimulated this desire. When pressing for integration, various terms, such as integration, integrated care, or interprofessional collaboration, are used in an interchangeable manner leading to lack of clarity, ambiguity and confusion for health care policy makers, planners, and other healthcare professionals. The literature was reviewed to identify critical components for community pharmacy to consider for integration. From the five selected articles describing integration of community pharmacies, four different constructs were identified: consensus, connectivity, communication and trust. The integration of community pharmacy into the health system may translate into better access for patients to primary care services, contribute to cost effectiveness, and promulgate the sustainability of the system. However significant political, economic, social, and practice change would be required by all stakeholders. Further research is needed to underpin a consensus for a definition, the type of integration, and the model optimally suited to integrate community pharmacy into primary care. These models, specific and adaptable to each national health care system and political environment, would need to be consensus-based by principal stakeholders to overcome a variety of barriers, including government resistance. Mere calls or demands by the pharmaceutical profession, although laudable, will not be sufficient to overcome the historical, cultural, and economic challenges.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
739,35016857,"CONSIDER New Mexico: Effects of naloxone training among pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. BACKGROUND Pharmacists serve a critical role in providing health care, especially in medically underserved areas. Despite the opioid crisis and legislation in most states allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription from another provider, pharmacists face multiple barriers to dispensing naloxone. OBJECTIVE This study tested the effectiveness of CONSIDER New Mexico, an innovative educational initiative designed to increase naloxone dispensing by pharmacies. METHODS A quasi-experimental study was conducted in New Mexico in 2019-2020. Community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were recruited from a purposive sample of pharmacies. Data were collected through pre- and postintervention surveys with 65 pharmacists and 44 technicians from 49 pharmacies. Data analysis included hybrid fixed-effects regression models of variables associated with pre-post intervention change in intent to dispense naloxone and generalized least squares with maximum likelihood estimation for pre-post intervention change in naloxone dispensing. RESULTS Positive intervention effects were observed for measures of normative beliefs, self-efficacy, and intent to dispense naloxone (P < 0.05). Changes in normative beliefs and self-efficacy were associated with greater intent to offer naloxone to patients (P < 0.05). In addition, the median number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed per month increased 3.5 times after intervention. A statistically significant positive association was observed between the intervention and naloxone dispensing after adjusting for other factors (P < 0.001). Pharmacies providing more than 4 additional health services were more likely to increase naloxone dispensing postintervention than pharmacies offering not more than 2 services (P < 0.01). This difference averaged 19 naloxone prescriptions per month. Estimated change in dispensing postintervention was statistically significantly lower at independent, clinic-based, and other pharmacies where an average of 36 fewer naloxone prescriptions were dispensed per month compared with chain drug stores (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION The CONSIDER New Mexico intervention effectively increased self-efficacy, intent to dispense, and naloxone dispensing. Findings will inform future research examining widespread dissemination and implementation of the intervention and the sustainability of intervention effects.",1,1,0,0,0,Intervention was training delivered to pharmacists and not pharmacist intervention.,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to evaluate the knowledge of community pharmacists on cancer and screening methods. SETTING AND METHOD This study was a descriptive cross-sectional study and was conducted between January-June 2020 in Istanbul/Turkey. a structured questionnaire was applied to pharmacists as online. The questionnaire was prepared by the researchers and consisted of 49 questions; basic information about cancer (15 items), signs and symptoms (11 items), causes and risk factors (14 items), cancer screening methods (9 items). RESULTS It was determined that the majority (>90%) of the pharmacists did not receive any education on cancer and/or cancer screening methods after graduation. The sufficient knowledge level of the pharmacists about cancer basics, signs and symptoms, and risk factors were found to be as 80%, 77%, and 67%, respectively. The internal consistency level of the questionnaire was calculated (Cronbach's alpha = 0.814). The item ""Every woman should perform breast self-examination and notify a health professional when there is a change in breast appearance or feeling,"" was answered correctly by 98% of the pharmacists. It was determined that 71% of the pharmacists gave the correct answer to the item ""Women aged 21-30 years should have a PAP smear every 3 years"". CONCLUSION According to the results of the study, while the rate of sufficient knowledge level on cancer was found to be low, knowledge on cancer screening was found to be sufficient.

OBJECTIVE We conducted this scoping review to map and summarize scientific evidence on the role of clinical pharmacists in the palliative care of adults and elderly patients with cancer. DATA SOURCES A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and BVS/BIREME for studies published until November 22nd, 2020. Studies that reported work experiences adopted by clinical pharmacists in the palliative care of adults and elderly patients with cancer were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third and fourth authors. The pharmacist interventions identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. DATA SUMMARY A total of 586 records were identified, of which 14 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n  =  5) and Canada (n  =  5) and described the workplace of the pharmacist in clinic/ambulatory (n  =  10). Clinical pharmacists performed several activities and provided services, highlighting medication review (n  =  12), patient and caregivers education (n  =  12), medication histories and-or medication reconciliation (n  =  6). The pharmacist interventions were mostly conducted for patients/caregivers (n  =  13), by one-on-one contact (n  =  14), and by face-to-face (n  =  13). Pharmacists were responsible mainly for change or suggestion for change in therapy (n  =  12) and patient counselling (n  =  12). Pharmacist interventions were well accepted by the clinical team. Overall, studies showed that pharmacists, within an interdisciplinary team, had significant impacts on measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In recent years, there have been advances in the role of the pharmacist in palliative care of patients with cancer and there are great opportunities in this field. They play an important role in managing cancer pain and other symptoms, as well as resolving drug related problems. We encourage more research to be carried out to strengthen this field and to benefit patients with advanced cancer with higher quality of life.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Despite global consensus on the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), implementation of strategies to improve adherence of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) remains sub-optimal, especially in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to assess the effect of clinical pharmacist-led clinical audit to improve the compliance of discharge prescriptions in patients admitted with ACS. It is a prospective clinical audit of ACS patients which was carried out for 12 months. The discharge prescriptions were audited by clinical pharmacists for the appropriateness in the usage of statins, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). A feedback report was presented every month to the cardiologists involved in the patient care, and the trend in the adherence to GDMT was analyzed over 12 months. RESULTS The discharge prescriptions of 1072 ACS patients were audited for the justifiable and non-justifiable omissions of mandated drugs. The first-month audit revealed unreasonable omissions of DAPT, statin, ACE-I/ARB, and beta-blockers in 1%, 0%, 14%, and 11% respectively, which reduced to nil by the end of the 11th month of the audit-feedback program. This improvement remained unchanged until the end of the 12th month.

747,35020478,"Access to Telepharmacy Services May Reduce Hospital Admissions in Outpatient Populations During the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Introduction: Avoidable hospital admissions put increased pressure on already strained health care resources, causing emotional and financial distress for patients and their families while taxing the health system. Pharmacist involvement in patient care has been shown to improve health care outcomes. Telepharmacy allows for personalized interaction and access to pharmacy services in a flexible format. The primary aim of this report is to explore the impact that access to a personalized telepharmacy service has on the hospital admission rate in an outpatient population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A retrospective, double-arm cohort study was performed. Hospital admission rates were analyzed in two similarly aged groups; one group (n = 2,242) had access to telepharmacy services through their primary care provider and another group did not (n = 1,540), from 2019 to 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to explore hospitalization rates in both groups. Results: An increase in hospitalization rates was observed in both groups of patients from 2019 to 2020. The patient group that had access to the telepharmacy service demonstrated a reduced rise in hospitalization rates versus the group without access to the telepharmacy service (access group +12.9% vs. nonaccess group +40.2%, p < 0.05, Student's t-test). Discussion: The patient group with access to telepharmacy services demonstrated a reduced increase in hospitalizations versus the group without access in 2020. While this represents a preliminary investigation into the potential impacts of telepharmacy on hospitalization rates, telepharmacy services may have a role in improving patient outcomes and cost savings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to gauge postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residency candidates' reactions to supplemental applications, as well as aspects specific to our process, including a personality test and situational judgment test (SJT). METHODS After rank lists were submitted, applicants to our program were invited to complete an online survey. Outcomes of interest included candidates' perceptions of relevance and fairness. Whether candidates' attitudes differed based on the receipt of an interview offer was also assessed. RESULTS Of 199 applicants to our program for the 2021-2022 training year, 48 applicants (24.1%) completed the survey, 15 of whom had received an interview offer. Most (64.6%) agreed that supplemental applications were useful, and nearly all (95.8%) indicated that they were willing to submit one for programs in which they were most interested. The process was seen as being fair, although ratings were higher among those who received interview offers. Most respondents believed that the personality test and SJT were relevant to the role of a resident, but attitudes towards the SJT were generally more favorable and less likely to vary according to whether candidates received an interview offer. Candidates believed that the personality test and SJT were not as representative of them as letters of reference or their curriculum vitae, but perceptions of academic performance varied. CONCLUSION Applicants responded positively to our supplemental application and indicated that they would be willing to complete one for programs of interest.

750,35020803,"Current and investigational therapies for the treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation. PURPOSE Esmolol, dual sequential defibrillation, vector change defibrillation, and left stellate ganglion block are presented and reviewed for the treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation. SUMMARY Although no formal definition has been established for refractory ventricular fibrillation, the literature describes it as a pulseless ventricular arrhythmia that persists despite 3 standard defibrillation attempts, administration of amiodarone 300 mg intravenously, and provision of three 1-mg intravenous doses of epinephrine. Evolving literature surrounding resuscitation in this particular subset of cardiac arrest challenges the efficacy of traditional therapies, such as epinephrine, and suggests that other treatment modalities may improve outcomes. Case reports, case series, and small retrospective studies have pointed to benefit when utilizing a variety of therapies, namely, esmolol, dual sequential defibrillation, vector change defibrillation, or left stellate ganglion block, in patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation arrest. CONCLUSION A mounting, although limited, body of evidence suggests that esmolol, dual sequential defibrillation, vector change defibrillation, or left stellate ganglion block may be effective at terminating refractory ventricular fibrillation and improving patient outcomes. Further evidence is required before these therapies can be adopted as standard practice; however, as key members of the code response team, it is imperative for pharmacists to be familiar with the supporting evidence, safety considerations, and logistical challenges of utilizing these treatments during arrest.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
751,35022034,"Healthcare professionals' perceptions on barriers and facilitators to DMARD use in rheumatoid arthritis. BACKGROUND Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the cornerstone of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. However, the full benefits of DMARDs are often not realized because many patients are sub-optimally adherent to their medication. In order to optimize adherence, it is essential that healthcare professionals (HCPs) understand patients' barriers and facilitators for medication use. Insight in these barriers and facilitators may foster the dialogue about adequate medication use between HCPs and patients. What HCPs perceive as barriers and facilitators has, so far, scarcely been investigated. This study aimed to identify the perceptions of HCPs on patients' barriers and facilitators that might influence their adherence. METHODS This qualitative study was performed using semi structured in-depth interviews with HCPs. An interview guide was used, based on an adjusted version of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Thematic analysis was conducted to identify factors that influence barriers and facilitators to DMARD use according to HCPs. RESULTS Fifteen HCPs (5 rheumatologists, 5 nurses and 5 pharmacists) were interviewed. They mentioned a variety of factors that, according to their perceptions, influence DMARD adherence in patients with RA. Besides therapy-related factors, such as (onset of) medication effectiveness and side-effects, most variation was found within patient-related factors and reflected patients' beliefs, ways of coping, and (self-management) skills toward medication and their condition. In addition, factors related to the condition (e.g., level of disease activity), healthcare team and system (e.g., trust in HCP), and social and economic context (e.g. support, work shifts) were reported. CONCLUSIONS This study provided insights in HCPs' perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to DMARD use patients with RA. Most factors that were mentioned were patient-related and potentially modifiable. When physicians understand patients' perceptions on medication use, adherence to DMARDs can probably be optimized in patients with RA leading to more effectiveness of treatment outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Residential homes provide accommodation and assistance with personal care only and are not required to have registered nurses on site. However, their residents often have a combination of comorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty and mental-health conditions with poor access to healthcare to meet these needs. Integrated healthcare for older people is a key NHS priority in the Long-Term Plan and the Five-Year Forward View. We describe development and implementation of multi-disciplinary intervention to integrate healthcare and promote interprofessional education. METHODS A multi-disciplinary residential home quality improvement project in two cycles by a team comprising senior and trainee general practitioners, trainees in geriatrics, psychiatry, pharmacist and residential home senior staff. The intervention was underpinned by the framework for enhanced health in care homes including Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and mental-health review. Each intervention session included an educational presentation by a team member consideration of each resident in a pre-evaluation multi-disciplinary discussion followed by a structured clinical assessment and discussion of proposed management. RESULTS Three residential homes participated with a total 34 residents receiving intervention. In one residential home, there was a 75% reduction in admissions for those reviewed and a reduction in overall admission costs. Polypharmacy was reduced by an average of 2 medications per resident across the three sites. There was a 63% increase in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation decisions and 76% increase in advance care planning discussions.

754,35022953,"Self medication practices and its determinants in health care professionals during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic: cross-sectional study.  Background The exposure of health care professionals (HCP) to patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in the course of performing their professional duties may expose them to contracting the virus. This may likely increase their tendency to self-medicate for prevention or treatment of perceived infection. Aim This study determined the prevalence of COVID-19 related self-medication and its determinants among HCPs in three tertiary hospitals in Southern Nigeria. Method This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 669 adult HCPs from three tertiary hospitals in three Southern Nigerian States using a non-probability convenience sampling method. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Data entry and analysis were done using IBM SPSS version 22. Results The mean age of the respondents was 35.6 ± 8.7 years. Two hundred and forty-three respondents (36.3%) reported having practiced COVID-19 related self-medication. The commonly used medications were ivermectin, azithromycin, vitamin C, chloroquine and zinc. Factors associated with self-medication were older age (p =  < 0.0001), being pharmacist (p = 0.03), higher income (p =  < 0.0001), previous COVID-19 testing (p < 0.001). Predictors of self medication were > 44 years (Adjusted Odd Ratio[AOR]:2.77,95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.62-4.75, p =  < 0.0001), previous COVID-19 testing (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.82-3.94, p =  < 0.0001). Conclusion About one-third of HCPs practiced COVID-19 related self-medication. HCPs that are often assumed to be health literate may not necessarily practice safe health behavior. Regular health education of the HCPs on implications of self-medications is highly recommended. There should also be formulation and effective implementation of policies that regulate purchase of medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Medication error studies on pediatric cases were found to not only be limited but also the collaboration of clinical pharmacists and physicians on this topic was not published in Turkey. This study aimed to identify drug-related problems, especially in antibiotics. METHODS This study was a point prevalence study with pediatric inpatients that used at least one antibiotic at a pediatric tertiary care reference hospital on November 16, 2016. Medications of patients were evaluated by clinical pharmacists in terms of drug-related problems and by physicians in terms of correct indications. RESULTS Eighty-nine hospitalized patients were using antibiotics at the time of the study. The median age was 42 months (range: 1-226 months), and 49 (55.1%) of the patients were male. Clinical pharmacists detected a total of 210 potential drug-drug interactions in 46 (51.7%) patients. Approximately 48.5% of the patients in pediatric wards and 52.4% of the patients in surgical wards had at least one potential drug-drug interaction. A total of 39 medication errors were identified in 36 patients` drug orders. Most of the errors (51.3%) were due to dosing and administration time errors (35.9%). The number of errors per patient in surgical services was higher (0.47) than the pediatric services (0.42). Forty-three percent of errors were antimicrobial-related, and 70.5% of them were classified as dosing errors.

756,35023836,"Evaluation of a web-based medication reconciliation application within a primary care setting: Results from a cluster randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND Despite routine review of medication lists during patient encounters, patients' medication lists are often incomplete and not reflective of actual medication use. Contributing to this situation is the challenge of reconciling medication information from existing health records, along with external locations (e.g. pharmacies, other provider/hospital records and care facilities) and patient-reported use. Advances in interoperability and digital collection of information provides a foundation for integration of these once disparate information sources. OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of and satisfaction with an electronic health record (EHR) integrated web-based medication reconciliation application, MedTrue™ (MT). METHODS We conducted a cluster randomized trial of MT in six primary care clinics within an integrated healthcare delivery system. Our primary outcome was medication list accuracy as determined by a pharmacist collected best possible medication history (BPMH). Patient and staff perspectives were evaluated through surveys and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS Overall, 224 patients were recruited and underwent a BPMH with the pharmacist (118 usual care, 106 MT). For our primary outcome of medication list accuracy, 7.5% in MT and 7.6% in usual care had zero discrepancies (OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.38-2.72, P=0.98). The most common discrepancy identified was patient-reported medication no longer taking (2.48 UC vs. 2.58 MT, P=0.21). Patients found MT easy to use and on average would highly recommend MT (average net promoter score 8/10). Staff found MT beneficial, but difficult to implement. CONCLUSIONS The use of a web-based application integrated into the EHR which combines EHR, patient reported, and pharmacy dispense data did not improve medication list accuracy among a population of primary care patients compared to usual care, but was well received by patients. Future studies should address the limitations of the current application and assess whether improved implementation strategies impact the effectiveness of the application.

757,35023925,"Assessment of Knowledge, Practices, and Challenges of Pharmaceuticals Inventory Control Among Pharmacy Professionals Working in Selected Public Health Facilities of West Arsi Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. Background Good pharmaceutical inventory control enables health facilities (HFs) to provide complete health care by ensuring the availability of safe, effective, and affordable pharmaceuticals and related supplies of the required quality, inadequate quantity, at the required place and at all times. It boosts patients' trust in the HFs and motivates working staff. However, it needs well-trained and skilled professionals. The aim of the current study was, therefore, assessing knowledge, practice, and challenges of pharmacy professionals conducting inventory control in selected public health facilities of West Arsi Zone, Oromia regional state for the year 2016 to 2018. Method A mixed-methods study design was used to assess pharmacy professionals' knowledge, skills, and challenges in applying inventory management methods. A semi-structured questionnaire was implemented for quantitative, whereas an open-ended question was employed for key informants (KIs) to explore qualitative data. Result Ninety percent of pharmacy professionals knew about VEN analysis concepts and 70% about ABC analysis. However, none of them had a concept of FSN and XYZ analysis. Among the respondents who knew the concept, 75% had gained knowledge through formal training and 10% of them learned from on-job training. When they asked about the methods of inventory control, 60% responded as they did not hear about it. Of those who said ""Yes"" on being asked to mention at least 1 method of it, 80% could not able to correctly mention the methods used in inventory control. However, 44%, 62.5%, and 75% of respondents had practiced ABC, VED, and ABC-VED matrix analysis respectively. The challenges that prevented these professionals from practicing pharmaceutical inventory control in their HFs were grouped into price-related, training-related, human resource-related, and managerial-related factors. Conclusion Inventory control is the heart of the pharmaceutical supply system. Without its healthy action, HFs' goal attainment will not be viable. Problems of sick pharmaceutical inventory control are directly related to a lack of knowledge and appreciation of it by the concerned bodies. The current finding revealed almost all pharmacy professionals included in the study had little knowledge about how to manage their inventories. Managers' unwillingness to cooperate and facilitate necessary resources prevented the professionals from doing inventory control.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
758,35024035,"A Targeted Approach to Improve Asthma Control Using Community Pharmacists.  Background: Building on lessons learnt from evidence-based community pharmacy asthma management models, a streamlined and technology supported Pharmacy Asthma Service (PAS) was developed to promote the integration of the service into routine practice. Objective: This study investigates the efficacy of the PAS in improving asthma symptom control and other health outcomes. Methods: A two-arm pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial was implemented in 95 pharmacies across three Australian States. Participants were adults with poorly controlled asthma as per the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), with or without allergic rhinitis. Patients within the PAS arm engaged in four consultations with the pharmacist over a 12-month period. An evidence-based algorithm guided pharmacies, via a trial specific software, to deliver a series of interventions targeting three issues underpinning uncontrolled asthma (medication use and adherence, inhaler technique, and allergic rhinitis management) to patient clinical asthma status and patient need. Comparator arm patients received a minimal intervention likened to usual practice involving referral of eligible patients to the GP and two follow-up consultations with their pharmacist to collect comparative data. Results: In total, 143 of 221 PAS patients (65%) and 111 of 160 comparator patients (69%) completed the trial. Improvements in asthma control were achieved in both the PAS (mean difference (MD) in ACQ from baseline = -1.10, p <.0001) and comparator (MD in ACQ from baseline = -0.94, p <.0001) arms at the trial end; however, there were no significant differences between the two arms (MD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.08, p = 0.19). Patients' quality of life in the PAS arm improved significantly when compared with the comparator arm (MD in Impact of Asthma on Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (IAQLQ) = -0.52, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.14, p = 0.0079). Conclusion: Despite the PAS achieving a greater improvement in patients' quality of life, the pharmacist-led service and usual practice arm produced comparable improvements in asthma control. These results ask us to reflect on current standards of usual care, as it appears the standard of asthma care in usual practice has evolved beyond what is reported in the literature.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Community,

760,35026796,"A Worldwide Bibliometric Analysis of Published Literature on Medication Errors. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to map the recent literature on medication error to monitor the state of research and explore emerging research fronts. Specifically, the co-occurrences analysis aimed to research the conceptual structure of the medication errors, whereas the coauthorship analysis aimed to research the ""authorities"" that influenced the academic and political discussion on medication errors. METHODS The search for relevant studies was carried out through the Scopus. To map and monitor the state of research on medication error, a preliminary analysis was conducted through the year of publication, type of article, and language. The count of citation shows the most relevant work among those included. Bibliometric analyses were conducted, such as coauthorship analysis and co-occurrences analysis. RESULTS The search strategy yielded 5393 articles. Of these, 1267 articles were included. Four main themes emerged from this bibliometric analysis: (a) the exploration of human factors related to health care professionals that increase the risk of medication error, (b) the investigation of behaviors and strategies that can prevent the error in the preparation and administration stage, (c) the analysis of the benefits related to the presence of the pharmacist in hospital settings, and (d) the exploration of the consequences of a medication error and/or adverse effects of drugs. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, a bibliometric analysis of medication errors research in the world has been conducted and demonstrated that there is a wealth of contributions already being made that are well aligned to the World Health Organization challenge.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
761,35027281,"Pharmacists improve diabetes outcomes: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND There is a growing shortage of primary care physicians. Pharmacists can fill the gap, and interdisciplinary teams are being evaluated as part of health care reform. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine whether adding a pharmacist to an interprofessional health team will improve diabetes outcomes. METHODS In this 2-phase pilot study, Medicaid-eligible patients with diabetes were randomized to receive standard of care (control arm) or standard of care plus the care of a pharmacist (intervention arm) for 12 months (phase 1). The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) from baseline. Secondary outcomes included identifying and correcting medication therapy problems (MTPs) for comorbid conditions, adherence to preventive care visits, health care utilization, self-rated health, and satisfaction surveys. After phase 1, patients in the control arm who did not achieve an A1C of < 8% were eligible to enroll into phase 2 where they received treatment with a pharmacist for 6 months. RESULTS Of the 239 patients enrolled, 122 completed phase 1. At 12 months, intervention patients' mean A1C was 1.85 percentage point (pp) below baseline versus 0.94 pp for control (between-group difference 0.91 pp; P = 0.0218). Most control patients (79%) who completed phase 1 and enrolled into phase 2 improved their A1C by more than 1 pp (P < 0.01). The pharmacists completed 806 patient visits and identified 2638 MTPs. Intervention patients were more adherent to preventive care visits with nutrition (P = 0.043), ophthalmology (P = 0.002), and dentistry (P = 0.007). For intervention patients, 78% rated their experience with the pharmacist as excellent whereas, for control patients, 37% rated their experience with their provider as excellent. CONCLUSION Pharmacist comanagement of patients with diabetes can significantly improve glucose control and patient satisfaction.

762,35027305,"Confusing terminology used in the abbreviation of pharmacy journal names.  The lack of commonly agreed terminology in pharmacy field is highly prevalent and may have influence on the relevance and robustness of the area, especially how others see pharmacy literature. Potential consequences of this poor perception of pharmacy field by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) could be the omission of several pharmacy-related Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) or the low indexing rate of pharmacy practice journals in MEDLINE. Journal name abbreviation, under the responsibility of the NLM, is the unambiguous way to identify a journal in bibliographic references and catalogs. The present study investigated the consistency of pharmacy journal abbreviations in the NLM Catalog. For the 290 journals containing any word with the root pharm in their names, a consistent procedure for NLM title abbreviations was found for 27 of the words in journal names but not for the abbreviation ""Pharm"", which represented several words with very different meanings: pharmaceutical, pharmaceutics, pharmacists, and pharmacy.

763,35027306,"A national study of the mental health literacy of community pharmacists. BACKGROUND Community pharmacists are in a prime position to communicate with and assist those with mental health needs. However, mental health literacy, which includes beliefs and knowledge of mental health conditions, can impact the provision of pharmacy services. The mental health literacy of community pharmacists in New Zealand is currently unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess the mental health literacy of community pharmacists in New Zealand. METHODS We employed a national cross-sectional online survey, evaluating attitudes towards mental illness, ability to recognise depression using a vignette and followed by questions related to the helpfulness of various interventions, and willingness to provide pharmacy services for people with mental illness in comparison to cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, opportunities for mental health training were explored. Participants were community pharmacists working in New Zealand contacted via mailing lists of professional bodies. RESULTS We received responses from 346 participants. The majority of participants showed positive attitudes towards mental illness and correctly identified depression in the vignette (87%). Participants rated counsellors (84%) and physical activity (92%) as the most helpful professionals and intervention respectively while only 43% considered antidepressants as helpful for depression. When compared to other people in the community, long-term functioning of the individual described in the vignette was rated poorly, especially in terms of increased likelihood to attempt suicide (85%) and reduced likelihood to be a productive worker (64%). Approximately 30% of participants reported reduced confidence/comfort while approximately half of participants reported greater interest in providing mental health-related care compared to cardiovascular disease. The participants also highlighted several areas for future mental health training they wished to undertake. CONCLUSIONS We have identified positive attitudes towards mental illness in our study. Participants correctly identified and supported evidence-based interventions for mild to moderate depression. However, we highlighted the need for ongoing mental health training to address knowledge gaps and enhance the confidence in providing mental health-related care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
764,35027357,"Strategies for Incorporating Health Disparities and Cultural Competency Training into the Pharmacy Curriculum and Co-curriculum.  Objective To detail strategies reported in the literature for strengthening both health disparities and cultural competency (HDCC) instruction within various portions of pharmacy curriculum and co-curriculum.Findings. An appraisal of current strategies for incorporation of HDCC into each aspect of the pharmacy curriculum and co-curriculum revealed a paucity of literature describing processes for incorporation of both health disparities (HD) and cultural competency (CC) teaching throughout the pharmacy student's experience. Classroom strategies involved a single or series of courses in HDCC. Activities found to be effective involved case-based and community engagement exercises. Described recommendations for experiential education included preceptor development in areas of HDCC in order to assess student understanding of health disparities concepts, increasing student engagement with diverse patient populations, and implementation of cross-cultural communication models at clinical sites. Co-curricular and interprofessional (IPE) portions of pharmacy training were found to permit greater methodological flexibility, as they often confronted fewer time or space constraints than classroom endeavors. Documented methods for teaching of HDCC within co-curricular and IPE experiences included service learning, study abroad, symposia, and forums.Summary. Findings suggest that conceptual frameworks for HDCC should be utilized throughout the pharmacy curriculum, with learning activities mapped to relevant pharmacy education standards to ensure coverage of important practice competencies. Best practices also involve the use of contemporary tools, strategies, and resources from a cross-section of disciplines that provide opportunities for learners to correct misconceptions and biases through active situational problem-solving.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

766,35028528,"Patients', pharmacists', and prescribers' attitude toward using blockchain and machine learning in a proposed ePrescription system: online survey. Objective To evaluate the attitudes of the parties involved in the system toward the new features and measure the potential benefits of introducing the use of blockchain and machine learning (ML) to strengthen the in-place methods for safely prescribing medication. The proposed blockchain will strengthen the security and privacy of the patient's prescription information shared in the network. Once the ePrescription is submitted, it is only available in read-only mode. This will ensure there is no alteration to the ePrescription information after submission. In addition, the blockchain will provide an improved tracking mechanism to ensure the originality of the ePrescription and that a prescriber can only submit an ePrescription with the patient's authorization. Lastly, before submitting an ePrescription, an ML algorithm will be used to detect any anomalies (eg, missing fields, misplaced information, or wrong dosage) in the ePrescription to ensure the safety of the prescribed medication for the patient. Methods The survey contains questions about the features introduced in the proposed ePrescription system to evaluate the security, privacy, reliability, and availability of the ePrescription information in the system. The study population is comprised of 284 respondents in the patient group, 39 respondents in the pharmacist group, and 27 respondents in the prescriber group, all of whom met the inclusion criteria. The response rate was 80% (226/284) in the patient group, 87% (34/39) in the pharmacist group, and 96% (26/27) in the prescriber group. Key Findings The vast majority of the respondents in all groups had a positive attitude toward the proposed ePrescription system's security and privacy using blockchain technology, with 72% (163/226) in the patient group, 70.5% (24/34) in the pharmacist group, and 73% (19/26) in the prescriber group. Moreover, the majority of the respondents in the pharmacist (70%, 24/34) and prescriber (85%, 22/26) groups had a positive attitude toward using ML algorithms to generate alerts regarding prescribed medication to enhance the safety of medication prescribing and prevent medication errors.

Background Pyronaridine-artesunate is the most recently licensed artemisinin-based combination therapy. WHO has recommended that a single low dose of primaquine could be added to artemisinin-based combination therapies to reduce Plasmodium falciparum transmission in areas aiming for elimination of malaria or areas facing artemisinin resistance. We aimed to determine the efficacy of pyronaridine-artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with and without single low-dose primaquine for reducing gametocyte density and transmission to mosquitoes. Methods We conducted a four-arm, single-blind, phase 2/3, randomised trial at the Ouélessébougou Clinical Research Unit of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako (Bamako, Mali). Participants were aged 5-50 years, with asymptomatic P falciparum malaria mono-infection and gametocyte carriage on microscopy, haemoglobin density of 9·5 g/dL or higher, bodyweight less than 80 kg, and no use of antimalarial drugs over the past week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatment groups: pyronaridine-artesunate, pyronaridine-artesunate plus primaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine. Treatment allocation was concealed to all study staff other than the trial pharmacist and treating physician. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and pyronaridine-artesunate were administered as per manufacturer guidelines over 3 days; primaquine was administered as a single dose in oral solution according to bodyweight (0·25 mg/kg; in 1 kg bands). The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in mosquito infection rate (percentage of mosquitoes surviving to dissection that were infected with P falciparum) at 48 h after treatment compared with baseline (before treatment) in all treatment groups. Data were analysed per protocol. This trial is now complete, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04049916. Findings Between Sept 10 and Nov 19, 2019, 1044 patients were assessed for eligibility and 100 were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups (n=25 per group). Before treatment, 66 (66%) of 100 participants were infectious to mosquitoes, with a median of 15·8% (IQR 5·4-31·9) of mosquitoes becoming infected. In individuals who were infectious before treatment, the median percentage reduction in mosquito infection rate 48 h after treatment was 100·0% (IQR 100·0 to 100·0) for individuals treated with pyronaridine-artesunate plus primaquine (n=18; p<0·0001) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine (n=15; p=0·0001), compared with -8·7% (-54·8 to 93·2) with pyronaridine-artesunate (n=17; p=0·88) and 50·4% (13·8 to 70·9) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=16; p=0·13). There were no serious adverse events, and there were no significant differences between treatment groups at any point in the frequency of any adverse events (Fisher's exact test p=0·96) or adverse events related to study drugs (p=0·64). The most common adverse events were headaches (40 events in 32 [32%] of 100 participants), rhinitis (31 events in 30 [30%]), and respiratory infection (20 events in 20 [20%]). Interpretation These data support the use of single low-dose primaquine as an effective supplement to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and pyronaridine-artesunate for blocking P falciparum transmission. The new pyronaridine-artesunate plus single low-dose primaquine combination is of immediate relevance to regions in which the containment of partial artemisinin and partner-drug resistance is a growing concern and in regions aiming to eliminate malaria.

In recent years, there has been a lot of research on the effectiveness of Kampo medicine. New findings from modern medicine are also being delivered in addition to traditional education in Japanese University. Kampo treatment covers a wide range of disorders. To achieve multidisciplinary cooperation in Kampo treatment, it is necessary to have an education system in which pharmacy, nursing, medicine and dentistry collaborate. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of Kampo classes in Japanese universities to clarify the problems experienced by each department and the needs for a system of interdisciplinary collaboration, and to examine what a new curriculum should encompass. We conducted a questionnaire survey of the Kampo curriculum at all medical, pharmaceutical, dental and nursing schools at universities in Japan. The target respondents were faculty members and administrators in charge of Kampo lectures. Multivariate analysis and correspondence analysis were conducted for multiple response items. Fisher's exact test and Cochrane's Q test were used to compare response frequency among departments and desired collaborators in each faculty, respectively. The results showed that the lack of instructors and the number of hours in the curriculum were problems in the departments of medicine, dentistry, and nursing. Medical, nursing, and dental departments cited the lack of time in their curriculum as a problem. The departments of medicine and pharmacy wished to further incorporate experiential learning (active learning) and problem-based learning/tutorial teaching methods. Incorporating an interdisciplinary collaboration system in the Kampo curriculum was required by a large percentage of respondents from all four academic departments.

774,34968394,"The challenge of involving old patients with polypharmacy in their medication during hospitalization in a medical emergency department: An ethnographic study. BACKGROUND More than 70% of patients admitted to emergency departments (EDs) in Denmark are older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy vulnerable to adverse events and poor outcomes. Research suggests that patient involvement and shared decision-making (SDM) could optimize the treatment of older patients with polypharmacy. The patients become more aware of potential outcomes and, therefore, often tend to choose less medication. However, implementing SDM in clinical practice is challenging if it does not fit into existing workflows and healthcare systems. AIM The aim was to explore the determinants of patient involvement in decisions made in the ED about the patient's medication. METHODS The design was a qualitative ethnographic study. We observed forty-eight multidisciplinary healthcare professionals in two medical EDs focusing on medication processes and patient involvement in medication. Based on field notes, we developed a semi-structured interview guide. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals to elaborate on the findings. Data were analyzed with thematic analyses. FINDINGS We found five themes (determinants) which affected patient involvement in decisions about medicine in the ED: 1) blurred roles among multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, 2) older patients with polypharmacy increase complexity, 3) time pressure, 4) faulty IT- systems, and 5) the medicine list as a missed enabler of patient involvement. CONCLUSION There are several barriers to patient involvement in decisions about medicine in the ED and some facilitators. A tailored medication conversation guide based on the SDM methodology combined with the patient's printed medicine list and well-functioning IT- systems can function as a boundary object, ensuring the treatment is optimized and aligned with the patient's preferences and goals.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
775,35031027,"Do pharmacy practice standards effectively describe behaviour? Reviewing practice standards using a behavioural specificity framework. BACKGROUND Guidelines and practice standards exist to communicate the conduct and behaviour expected of health care professionals and ensure consistent quality practice. It is important that they describe behaviours explicitly so they can be interpreted, enacted and measured with ease. The AACTT framework specifies behaviour in terms of the: Action to be performed, Actor who performs the action, Context where the action occurs, Target who the action is performed with/for and Time when the action is performed (AACTT). It provides the most up to date framework for specifying behaviours and is particularly relevant to complex behavioural problems that involve sequences of behaviours performed by different people. Behavioural specificity within pharmacy practice standards has not been explored. AIM To determine if behaviours described in the Professional Practice Standards for Australian Pharmacists specify Action, Actor, Context, Target and Time. METHODS Two researchers independently reviewed the scope and structure of the practice standards and one extracted action statements (behaviours) verbatim. Through an iterative process, the researchers modified and developed the existing AACTT definitions to operationalise them for application to review of the action statements in the practice standards. The operational definitions, decision criteria and curated examples were combined in a codebook. The definitions were consistently applied through a directed content analysis approach to evaluate all extracted action statements by one researcher. For consistency 20% was independently checked for agreement by a second researcher. RESULTS A novel codebook to apply AACTT criteria to evaluate practice standards was developed. Application of this codebook identified 768 independent behaviours. Of these, 300 (39%) described at least one discrete observable action, none specified an actor, 25 (3%) specified context, 131 (17%) specified target and 88 (11%) specified time. CONCLUSION(S) The behaviours detailed in practice standards for Australian pharmacists do not consistently specify behaviours in terms of Action, Actor, Context, Target and Time. Developers in the pharmacy profession, and beyond, should consider the behavioural specificity of their documents to improve interpretability, usability and adherence to the behaviours detailed. This also has implications for the development and evaluation of interventions to change such behaviours and improve quality of care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Intestinal Failure (IF) is a rare but serious form of organ failure, and patients with IF are dependent on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) to maintain growth and development. This study aimed to describe the experiences of a multidisciplinary clinical pharmacist-led TPN service in the Intestinal Rehabilitation Unit of Shiraz Organ Transplant Center. SUBJECTS/METHODS This prospective study was conducted in Shiraz Organ Transplant Center, Iran from February 2018 to October 2020, including seven months with and 24 months without the clinical pharmacist involvement. Clinical and nutritional outcomes as well as the potential complications of TPN were compared in these two periods. RESULTS This study was conducted on 107 patients. The most important complication occurred among the patients receiving TPN were catheter infection (42.05%), sepsis, and catheter thrombosis (18.69%). Portal vein thrombosis (OR = 26.56) and length of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (OR = 1.12) were significantly associated with the rate of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease. The results also revealed an association between the rate of sepsis and history of malignancy, catheter thrombosis, length of the small bowel, length of PN, length of hospital stay, and length of ICU stay. Moreover, the results showed a significant difference regarding the patients' outcomes and TPN complications before and after the clinical pharmacist interventions (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Working as a multidisciplinary team in Intestinal Rehabilitation Unit (IRU) has been suggested to improve patients' outcomes and reduce mortality and morbidity.

777,35032858,"Pharmacists expanded role in providing care for opioid use disorder during COVID-19: A qualitative study exploring pharmacists' experiences. INTRODUCTION During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) struggled with access to prescribers and opioid agonist therapy (OAT). Recognizing this gap in care, Health Canada issued a short-term subsection 56(1) class exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act authorizing pharmacists to independently manage controlled substances. The purpose of this study was to explore the expanded role of Canadian pharmacists in providing care to patients with OUD during the pandemic. METHODS We conducted qualitative key informant telephone interviews in the fall of 2020 with Canadian pharmacists who used the exemption. We included community or primary healthcare team-based pharmacists who managed opioid medication under the exemption. We recorded, transcribed verbatim, and de-identified all transcripts. Data was analyzed using a thematic approach involving line-by-line coding and constant comparison. RESULTS We interviewed nineteen pharmacists with representation from all provinces and urban and rural practice settings. Three major themes emerged that captured the pharmacists' perspectives when providing care for patients with OUD during the pandemic: (i) continuity of care; (ii) harm reduction; and (iii) access to care. Pharmacists used the exemption to extend prescriptions, transfer prescriptions, receive verbal orders, and deliver OAT. CONCLUSIONS Throughout the pandemic, pharmacists were able to provide continuity of care to patients with OUD who would have otherwise been unable to access care. The exemption permitted pharmacists to assess patients and provide OAT through this expanded role. Other countries should look to the Canadian experience and leverage the expertise of the pharmacist to expand their scope so that they can help fill the gap in care for patients with OUD.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
778,35033079,"Clinical pharmacist assessment of drug-related problems among intensive care unit patients in a Turkish university hospital. BACKGROUND Critically ill patients treated in the intensive care units (ICUs) often suffer from side effects and drug-related problems (DRPs) that can be life-threatening. A way to prevent DRPs and improve drug safety and efficacy is to include clinical pharmacists in the clinical team. This study aims to evaluate the classification of drug-related problems and the implementation of clinical pharmacy services by a clinical pharmacist in the ICU of a university hospital in Turkey. METHODS This study was carried out prospectively between December 2020 and July 2021 in Gazi University Medical Faculty Hospital Internal Diseases ICU. All patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for more than 24 h were included in the study. During the study, the clinical pharmacist's interventions and other clinical services for patients were recorded. DRPs were classed according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe V.8.02. RESULTS A total of 151 patients were included during the study period corresponding to 2264 patient-days. Patients with DRPs had a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality rate (p < 0.05). 108 patients had at least one DRP and the total number of DRPs was 206. There was an average of 1.36 DRPs per patient, 71.5% of patients experienced DRP and 89.22 DRPs per 1000 patient-days. A total of 35 ADEs were observed in 32 patients. ADE incidence was per 1000 patient-days 15.45. ADEs were caused by nephrotoxicity (48.57%), electrolyte disorders (17.14%), drug-induced thrombocytopenia (17.14%), liver enzyme increase (8.57%) and other causes (8.57%). Drug selection (40.29%) and dose selection (54.36%) constituted most of the causes of DRPs. Dose change was the highest percentage of planned interventions with a rate of 56.79%. Intervention was accepted at a rate of 90.8% and it was fully implemented. CONCLUSION In this study, the importance of the clinical pharmacist in the determination and analysis of DRPs was emphasized. Clinical pharmacy services like the one described should be implemented widely to increase patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction Seasonal influenza is considered as one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This needs solutions to decrease burdens on the healthcare systems especially during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Population knowledge, perception and attitude towards influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic could have a positive impact to decrease mortality, morbidity and burdens on the healthcare system. This study focuses on investigating knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of Jordanian adults towards influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 1112 randomly selected Jordanian adults. A four-part questionnaire was designed and included questions about the demographic and clinical characteristics, perception about influenza, attitudes towards the role of influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that affect respondents' practice towards influenza vaccine. Results 73.1% population were not vaccinated, and most were not willing to be vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 55% of the population thought that influenza vaccine decreased the burden on the Jordanian healthcare system. The major refusal factor to be vaccinated was because influenza was not considered as a threat (41.3%). People mostly got their information about influenza vaccine from social media (64.3%). The role of the pharmacist and physician was neglected. Conclusions The reinforcement of the role of pharmacists, physician and media to educate people about the importance of influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed. Furthermore, campaigns should be conducted to increase the population awareness towards the importance of influenza vaccine uptake and its importance.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background In 2018, a virtual community of practice (CoP) for pharmacists working in family medicine groups (FMGs) in Quebec province was developed. The aim of this CoP-called Réseau Québécois des Pharmaciens GMF (RQP GMF)-was to foster best practices by supporting FMG pharmacists. This study assesses the processes and outcomes of this CoP 2 years after its creation. Methods We performed a cross-sectional web-based study from March to May 2020. All FMG pharmacists who were registered as members of the RQP GMF (n = 326) were sent an invitation via a newsletter. The link to the questionnaire was also publicized in the CoP Facebook group. The questionnaire comprised a 38-item validated instrument assessing 8 dimensions of the CoP. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results A total of 112 FMG pharmacists (34.4%) completed the questionnaire. Respondents agreed that the RQP GMF was a joint enterprise (mean score, 4.18/5), that members shared their knowledge (mean score, 3.94/5) and engaged mutually (mean score, 3.50/5) and that the RQP GMF provided support (mean score, 3.92/5) and capacity building (mean score, 4.01/5). In general, they were satisfied with the implementation process (mean score, 3.68/5) and with activities proposed (mean score, 3.79/5). A lower proportion of respondents agreed that their participation in the RQP GMF generated external impacts, which led to a smaller mean score (3.37/5) for this dimension. Conclusion The RQP GMF, one of the first communities of practice for pharmacists practising in family medicine groups, attained most of the objectives initially intended by the CoP. These results will facilitate the adaptation of processes and activities to better fulfil members' needs. Can Pharm J (Ott) 2021;154:xx-xx.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
788,35035642,"Assessing the impact of a cannabis course on pharmacy students' understanding, beliefs and preparedness regarding medical and recreational cannabis. Background With the legalization of cannabis in Canada in 2018, pharmacists are increasingly likely to encounter patients using this substance. The primary objective of this pre-post questionnaire study was to evaluate the impact of an accredited cannabis course on the understanding, beliefs, perceptions and knowledge of undergraduate PharmD students. Methods A 38-question, web-based survey generated in REDCap was administered to third-year PharmD students at the University of Waterloo, prior to and right after taking an accredited cannabis course. The pre- and postsurvey data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Pearson chi-square tests were performed on questions in which answers consisted of qualitative categorical data. Two-sided t tests were performed to test the significance of mean differences of questions measuring continuous variables. Results In a class of 120 students, 110 completed the presurvey and 79 students completed the postsurvey. After the course, students were more likely to report being knowledgeable and prepared for patient encounters dealing with medical and recreational cannabis, understanding that medical cannabis should be prescribed for select (vs all) medical conditions, rating the quality of evidence as poor to moderate for medical use of cannabis, understanding that medical documents should be more prescriptive and understanding that cannabis should not be sold in pharmacies (p < 0.05). Interpretation With cannabis education a part of their curriculum, pharmacy students felt more prepared to engage patients using cannabis both medically and recreationally. Furthermore, students were more cautious regarding the potential use of cannabis therapeutically and indicated that more oversight should be in place.

789,35036418,"Sarcopenia, systemic immune-inflammation index and all-cause mortality in middle-aged and older people with COPD and asthma: a population-based study. Background Increasing evidence suggests that sarcopenia and a higher systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) are linked with morbidity in patients with COPD. However, whether these two conditions contribute to all-cause mortality in middle-aged and older patients with COPD or asthma is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association between sarcopenia, SII, COPD or asthma and all-cause mortality in a large-scale population-based setting. Methods Between 2009 and 2014, 4482 participants (aged >55 years; 57.3% female) from the population-based Rotterdam Study were included. COPD and asthma patients were diagnosed clinically and based on spirometry. Six study groups were defined according to the presence or absence of COPD or asthma and sarcopenia. Cox regression models were used to assess all-cause mortality in the study groups, adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, SII, smoking, oral corticosteroid use and comorbidities. In addition, all participants were categorised into sex-specific quartiles of SII, and mortality in these groups was compared. Results Over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range 5.0-7.2 years), 466 (10.4%) persons died. Independent of the presence of sarcopenia, participants with COPD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 2.13, 95% CI 1.46-3.12 and HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.18 for those with and without sarcopenia, respectively). Compared to lower SII levels, higher SII levels increased mortality risk even in people without sarcopenia, COPD or asthma. Conclusion Middle-aged and older people with COPD, higher SII levels or sarcopenia had an independently increased mortality risk. Our study suggests prognostic usefulness of routinely evaluating sarcopenia and SII in older people with COPD or asthma.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
790,35037775,"Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia among breast Cancer patients in a tertiary care hospital: Risk and consequences. STUDY OBJECTIVE To identify the risk factors that may predispose breast cancer patients to Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) and its associated complications for the years 2018 and 2020. CIN is an established complication of breast cancer treatment. Clinical Pharmacists can play an important role in the treatment of CIN through involvement in risk assessment to identify patients for oral antimicrobial therapy, drug therapy monitoring, and development of suitable guidelines or policies. METHODOLOGY A retrospective study was performed by collecting data of 72 breast cancer patients for the last two years from department of Medical Oncology in a tertiary care hospital. RESULTS The overall occurrence of CIN was 59.7% in our study population. Out of 72 patients studied, 43 patients were found to be neutropenic. Using Pearson Chi square test, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia was associated with older age (over 60 y) (p < 0.038), diabetes mellitus (p < 0.050), tumour stage IIIa (p < 0.024), AC (p < 0.051) and taxane chemotherapy regimens (p < 0.041). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 37.28% of patients and the incidence of infection-related mortality [severe septicaemia] was 3.38%. CONCLUSION The incorporation of clinical pharmacist must be brought into practice in our country for providing proper guidance to the patient on CIN and its complications.

791,35037778,"Addressing the Challenges of Novel Oncology and Hematology Treatments Across Sites of Care: Specialty Pharmacy Solutions. BACKGROUND The number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for anticancer therapies has significantly increased in recent years, but these novel therapies are costly and present challenges to patients and providers. Many institutions have implemented health systems specialty pharmacies (HSSPs) to help patients and providers navigate financial and logistical barriers to treatment with oral anticancer therapies. Patients on oral anticancer therapy are often treated across multiple sites of care which can complicate the inpatient specialty medication initiation process. Health systems often limit inclusion of oral anticancer therapies for inpatient administration due to costs, however several new therapies necessitate admission for treatment initiation. Health systems are then faced with the challenge of starting costly oral anticancer therapy inpatient and ensuring continued access to therapy upon discharge. We describe the integrated HSSP multidisciplinary approach to this MUP including providers, inpatient and outpatient pharmacists, specialty and inpatient pharmacies, institutional procurement team, and the institutional pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee to streamline this process.The HSSP multidisciplinary processes addresses a growing need for cancer patients to receive timely and affordable treatments across different sites of care. The healthcare team and P&T committee ensure the patient receives the most appropriate therapy while being conscious of health-system costs. The HSSP and procurement team ensure the patient can obtain and afford the medication. The implemented processes allows for direct communication and collaboration between different sites of care and this collaborative approach leads to optimal patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (allo-HSCT) is capable of curing patients with neoplastic or non-neoplastic hematologic disorders or of prolonging their survival. This study assessed if the insertion of the clinical pharmacist in the allo-HSCT team modified the outcomes: transplantation-related mortality, grafting failure, incidence of Graft versus Host Disease, hospitalization time, time for grafting, number of readmissions, number of drug-related problems (DRPs), adherence and knowledge about pharmacotherapy.Methods: Interventional study with historical control carried out in an allo-HSCT unit, in which the intervention group (IG) included 33 individuals who received pharmacotherapy follow-up. Control Group (CG) consisted of 28 individuals. Results: A total of 250 DRPs were identified, 59 team's doubts were clarified, and 309 interventions were conducted in the IG. The DRPs mainly arose from safety (51.60%) and effectiveness (38.40%) problems. A mean of 9.36 (SD = 6.97) interventions per patient was obtained, mainly including dose reductions (19.09%), adjustments in administration time (18.12%), educational activities (15.21%) and drug removal (10.68%). Clinical significance of the interventions was considered high (75.7% extremely significant, very significant or significant), as well as their acceptability (89.7% accepted). Each patient attended a mean of 4.68 pharmaceutical consultations (SD = 1.91) after hospital discharge, presenting increase in knowledge (p = 0.0001) and in adherence (p = 0.0115). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in the other outcomes analyzed.Conclusions: The pharmacotherapy follow-up allowed detecting several DRPs and performing interventions of high clinical relevance and acceptability, in addition to improving adherence and individualizing the pharmacotherapy.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Oncology,,,,Inpatient,
793,35037810,"Retrospective study evaluating immune-related adverse events in cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab. INTRODUCTION Pembrolizumab has been on the market for several years, but most of the safety data is based on clinical trials with limited literature evaluating post-marketing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with its use. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of irAEs associated with pembrolizumab. METHODS We included adult patients who had received pembrolizumab between January 2016 and December 2020. The patient electronic profiles and the pharmacy adverse event reporting system were reviewed to identify adverse events. Patients were followed from the start of treatment until 12 months after the last dose, end of the study, or death. The characteristics of the patients and the irAEs were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with the development of irAE. RESULTS During the study period, 223 patients and 1601 cycles of pembrolizumab were evaluated. A total of 67 irAEs were reported in 58 patients. The median age was 53 years (range 18-84), and most patients were males (75%) with metastatic lung cancer (62%). The most common irAEs were respiratory (30%), followed by gastrointestinal (25%), endocrine (24%), and dermatologic (21%). Among the reported irAEs, 28 were associated with hospital admission, 15 required long-term treatment, and 9 resulted in pembrolizumab discontinuation. In logistic regression, there were no significant predictors associated with irAE. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory irAEs were the most common in our population. We were unable to identify predictors of irAE in this cohort. Further studies are necessary to identify predictors of adverse events.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND The aim of the study was estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) and drug related problems (DRP) in an acute geriatric ward, and to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical intervention on their prevalence. METHODS Quasi-experimental, interventional study in polymedicated patients (= 6 drugs) who were admitted to a Geriatric ward in 2018-2019. PIP were analyzed according to STOPP/START 2014 criteria and DRP on the Third Consensus of Granada. The PIP and DRP detected, and the possible actions to correct them, were sent to the physician in charge. The effect of the intervention was analyzed at hospital discharge; if the change of prevalence of PIP and DRP was =75%, the pharmaceutical intervention was considered to be accepted. RESULTS Pharmaceutical intervention was performed on 218 patients, analyzing 1,837 prescriptions. On admission, PIP (90.8%) and DRP (99.5%) were observed. We carried out 1,227 interventions, 57.6% on DRP. More than half (53.6%) of the pharmaceutical interventions were accepted; the PIP according to the STOPP and START criteria was reduced by 49.7 and 22.1%, respectively; DRP decreased by 60.1%. The frequencies and medians of PRM and PPI according to the START and STOPP criteria decreased significantly at discharge. The variables most frequently associated with acceptance of the pharmaceutical intervention were the geriatrician at charge, the number of PPI START and the number of PPI STOPP. CONCLUSION The detection of PIP and DRP of chronic treatment during hospital admission by the pharmacist, and in collaboration with the patient's doctor, helps to reduce the prevalence of PIP and DRP.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

796,35038341,"To swab or not to swab? Using point-of-care tests to detect Group A Streptococcus infections as part of a Sore Throat Test and Treat service in community pharmacy. BACKGROUND The community pharmacy-led Sore Throat Test and Treat (STTT) service in Wales allowed pharmacists to undertake a structured clinical assessment with FeverPAIN/Centor scores and a point-of-care test (POCT) for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection. A new service model was temporarily agreed as a result of COVID-19, without routine use of POCT. OBJECTIVES To explore the impact of removing the requirement for GAS POCT from a community pharmacy STTT service on antibiotic supply. METHODS Analysis of STTT consultation data, obtained for two periods: November 2018 (date the service went live) to September 2019 (pre-pandemic); and November 2020 (date the new service model was introduced) to May 2021. RESULTS For consultations eligible for POCT, the antibiotic supply rate increased from 27% (922/3369) (95% CI: 26%-29%) with the pre-pandemic service model (FeverPAIN/Centor + POCT) to 63% (93/147) (95% CI: 55%-71%) with the new model (FeverPAIN/Centor only); the percentage of patients who were not issued an antibiotic, despite their high clinical score, decreased from 56% (646/1154) to 9.3% (8/86). CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data suggest that for every 100 STTT consultations with patients with a Centor score of ≥3 or a FeverPAIN score of ≥2, the use of POCT may spare up to 36 courses of antibiotics, increasing to 47 for patients with higher clinical scores, suggesting that the pre-COVID delivery model (FeverPAIN/Centor + POCT) is the optimal pathway and POCT in addition to clinical scores may result in fewer antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat symptoms. These findings have implications for STTT service delivery during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",0,0,1,1,1,Reviewer 1 initially did not see that intervention was a change in pharmacist provided service.,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Community,

STUDY OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pharmacist presence or pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship interventions on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics in the emergency department (ED). METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were conducted. Studies describing the role of pharmacists and their association with antimicrobial stewardship in the ED were included. The comparator for pharmacist intervention was hours without a pharmacist present, preprotocol implementation, and nonpharmacist culture follow-up. RESULTS In total, 24 studies (9,984 patients) were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 22 studies (5,791 patients) had data for the primary outcome and were included for the quantitative assessment (meta-analysis). Appropriate prescribing of antibiotics was more likely with pharmacist intervention (22 studies; odds ratio [OR], 3.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.39 to 5.03), particularly among patients with pneumonia (5 studies; OR, 3.74; 95% CI 2.14 to 6.54) or urinary tract infection (4 studies; OR, 1.76; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.50). Time to culture review was similar with or without pharmacist intervention. Time to appropriate antibiotic was shorter with pharmacist intervention (mean difference, 18.9 hours; 95% CI 11.9 to 25.9; P<.001). Repeat ED visit for the same complaint was not significant (10 studies; OR, 0.65; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10).

INTRODUCTION A venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis policy should be in place at all hospitals. While professional societies provide general guidance, they do not take into account the full range of procedures in this area. The aim of this study was to fill these &#8220;blank spaces&#8221; and design a VTE prophylaxis system which would reflect the wide range of surgical procedures. METHODS We conducted an extensive literature review. Surgeons were subsequently asked to help score procedures according to VTE and bleeding risk while taking into consideration procedure type and duration, surgical techniques, etc. Results: Clinical pharmacists proposed a standardized VTE prophylaxis protocol. For some surgical fields the Caprini risk assessment model (RAM) was adapted. A unique VTE prophylaxis system was created for surgical fields where Caprini RAM has not been validated. We proposed dosage adjustments for obese patients and for patients with renal impairment. A dedicated software application was developed. CONCLUSION The implementation of the VTE prophylaxis system resulted in a uniform and more rational prescription of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis as well as in financial savings. The development of the app increased compliance with the system and, in combination with real-time auditing, significantly improved safe drug administration practices at Military University Hospital Prague. The system is unique in continental Europe and contains wide range of surgical procedures and matching VTE prophylaxis, which has never before been published in this scope.

BACKGROUND Patients recovering from an episode in an intensive care unit (ICU) frequently experience medication errors on transition to the hospital ward. Structured handover recommendations often underestimate the challenges and complexity of ICU patient transitions. For adult ICU patients transitioning to a hospital ward, it is currently unclear what interventions reduce the risks of medication errors.The aims were to examine the impact of medication-related interventions on medication and patient outcomes on transition from adult ICU settings and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. METHODS The systematic review protocol was preregistered on PROSPERO. Six electronic databases were searched until October 2020 for controlled and uncontrolled study designs that reported medication-related (ie, de-prescribing; medication errors) or patient-related outcomes (ie, mortality; length of stay). Risk of bias (RoB) assessment used V.2.0 and ROBINS-I Cochrane tools. Where feasible, random-effects meta-analysis was used for pooling the OR across studies. The quality of evidence was assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. RESULTS Seventeen studies were eligible, 15 (88%) were uncontrolled before-after studies. The intervention components included education of staff (n=8 studies), medication review (n=7), guidelines (n=6), electronic transfer/handover tool or letter (n=4) and medicines reconciliation (n=4). Overall, pooled analysis of all interventions reduced risk of inappropriate medication continuation at ICU discharge (OR=0.45 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.63), I2=55%, n=9) and hospital discharge (OR=0.39 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.76), I2=75%, n=9). Multicomponent interventions, based on education of staff and guidelines, demonstrated no significant difference in inappropriate medication continuation at the ICU discharge point (OR 0.5 (95% CI 0.22 to 1.11), I2=62%, n=4), but were very effective in increasing de-prescribing outcomes on hospital discharge (OR 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.55), I2=67%, n=6)). Facilitators to intervention delivery included ICU clinical pharmacist availability and participation in multiprofessional ward rounds, while barriers included increased workload associated with the discharge intervention process. CONCLUSIONS Multicomponent interventions based on education of staff and guidelines were effective at achieving almost four times more de-prescribing of inappropriate medication by the time of patient hospital discharge. Based on the findings, practice and policy recommendations are made and guidance is provided on the need for, and design of theory informed interventions in this area, including the requirement for process and economic evaluations.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Critical care,,,,Inpatient,
801,35043830,"Association between neck circumference and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: cross-sectional analysis from ELSA-Brasil. BACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a public health problem worldwide. Neck circumference (NC) is a simple anthropometric adiposity parameter that has been correlated with cardiometabolic disorders like NAFLD. OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between NC and NAFLD, considering their obesity-modifying effect, among participants from the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline study. DESIGN AND SETTINGS Cross-sectional study at the ELSA-Brasil centers of six public research institutions. METHODS This analysis was conducted on 5,187 women and 4,270 men of mean age 51.8 (± 9.2) years. Anthropometric indexes (NC, waist circumference [WC] and body mass index [BMI]), biochemical and clinical parameters (diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia) and hepatic ultrasound were measured. The association between NC and NAFLD was estimated using multinomial logistic regression, considering potential confounding effects (age, WC, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Effect modification was investigated by including the interaction term NC x BMI in the final model. RESULTS The frequency of NAFLD and mean value of NC were 33.6% and 33.9 (± 2.5) cm in women, and 45.8% and 39.4 (± 2.8) cm in men, respectively. Even after all adjustments, larger NC was associated with a greater chance of moderate/severe NAFLD (1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] for women; 1.05, 95% CI for men; P < 0.001). Presence of multiplicative interaction between NC and BMI (P < 0.001) was also observed. CONCLUSION NC was positively associated with NAFLD in both sexes, regardless of traditional adiposity indexes such as BMI and WC. The magnitude of the association was more pronounced among women.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
802,35044117,"Knowledge and practice of self-medication. BACKGROUND Self-medication (SM) is the usage of medicines to resolve self-identified health issues, and it is quite common in many countries. The current study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices of SM among attendants at an outpatient clinic of a Baghdad teaching hospital at Baghdad Medical City as well as to determine association of SM practice with some socio-demographic factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The current cross-sectional study was conducted with about 460 people attending outpatients at Baghdad teaching hospital from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. RESULTS The highest proportion of participants, 176 (44%), was found in the age group of 18-30 years, with 290 (72.5%) females representing the study sample. Around two-thirds (266) of participants were married, and a higher proportion of participants, 218 (54.5%), were government employees; in all, 77 (19%) of participants were either unemployed or housewives. A total of 241 (60%) participants of the study sample were graduates and 74 (18.5%) postgraduates. Considering monthly income, 140 (35%) participants were earning below Iraqi Dinar 5,00,000. Of all the participants, 12 (43%) of them were concerned about the side effects of taking medicines, and 9 of them (32%) due to require medical experiences, 5 of them (18%) due to the risk of missing a diagnosis, and another 4 of them (14%) and 100 of them (27%) of participants used medicine leaflets, 86 (23%) of them used previous prescription, while 67 (18%) of study participants asking the nurse or health assistant, and reminder 41 (11%) used the mass media as a source of information about medicines. The majority of participants, 331 (89%), depended on private pharmacies and only 37 (10%) of them depended on paramedics. About half of the participants, 167 (45%), mentioned name of the medicine while requesting, and 115 (31%) participants mentioned symptoms of the disease to pharmacist, and only 90 (24%) purchased the drug container (bottles, boxes, etc.). CONCLUSION SM is a common healthcare practice among the attendants outpatients at Baghdad teaching hospital with different socio-demographic characteristic. SM is more prevalent in young age group and among low-income people, hence there was a significant association between age and SM practice, as elderly people practice less SM because of chronic diseases and their use of multiple medicines. In addition, SM practice has increased due to the availability of medicines and their easy access from pharmacies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the article is to present and analyse one part of the printed dissertation De phthisi (On Tuberculosis) by Matú&#353; Palumbini, namely chapter VIII, Curatio perfecta (Perfect Treatment). Treatment of diseases in the 17th century was solely dependent on and linked to the medicinal products, many a time of exotic origin, prepared by pharmacists. In this regard our main research contribution is that it provides the then description of tuberculosis and elucidates the use and pecularities in its treatment. Simultaneously, we also present the authors view over the treatment methods, which he identified as the most effective in tuberculosis. As follows from the text, all conceivable treatments and medications to treat tuberculosis in the 17th century were widely used and prescribed. Many abbreviations and alchemical symbols were mentioned in the dissertation, especially in the prescriptions. Each prescription contains drug components, their amount expressed in apothecary measures and weights, and finally instructions for drug preparation and use, including designation of the prepared drug and dosage instructions.

804,35045877,"Lessons from a feasibility study testing an anticipatory care planning intervention for older adults at risk of functional decline: feedback from implementing stakeholders. BACKGROUND Anticipatory care is becoming increasingly important in effectively managing complex multimorbidity in aging populations, preventing further functional decline, and avoiding hospital admissions. This study aimed to elicit the feedback of participating general practitioners, practice managers, nurses and an adjunct pharmacist on the implementation strengths and limitations of a nurse-led, person-centered anticipatory care planning (ACP) intervention for older people at risk of functional decline in a primary care setting. The findings have implications for a full trial and intervention design. METHODS As part of a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) testing the ACP intervention, we sought feedback from implementing stakeholders: general practitioners (N = 3), practice staff (N = 3), research nurses (N = 5), and adjunct pharmacist (N = 1) in both the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI), UK. Following written, informed consent, they were interviewed to investigate their experience of participating in the implementation of the ACP intervention as part of the feasibility trial, and elicit any recommendations for a full trial. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, thematic analysis was employed to analyze data. The intervention consisted of home visits by specially trained nurses who assessed participants' health, discussed with them their health goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan following consultation with participants' General Practitioners and the adjunct clinical pharmacist. RESULTS Participating stakeholders indicated that the strengths of the implementation process included the training provided to the nurses, constructive collaboration of the research team, and structure of implementation process. Perceived limitations included the selection process and screening tool, communication between the research team and the nurses, the assessment questionnaire, and the final document left with the patient, as well as lack of access to medical records for the adjunct pharmacist. Recommendations include better communication and team-wide consensus on alterations to procedure and documents, and standardized protocols for patient selection, data collection, and reporting for research nurses. CONCLUSIONS The findings have identified strengths of the implementation process on which to build, and recognized limitations which can now be addressed to ensure improved efficiency and effectiveness in future trials.

PURPOSE We introduced the medication support and adverse events monitoring system using medical social networking service (SNS). METHODS Thirty-two gastric cancer patients who were treated with oral anticancer drugs were included in this study. Patients or their families input the status of medication and adverse events using the ICT terminal every day, and the pharmacist confirmed the input contents on the PC. If there was a serious adverse events, the nurse confirmed the status of patient by telephone. RESULTS Of the 32 registered cases, 3 cases (9.3%) discontinued input within less than 2 months during treatment. We experienced a case whose adverse events could be dealt with during long vacations and a case whose treatment could be continued by sharing information with home-visit nursing stations. In the questionnaire survey, there were many opinions that it would lead to anxiety reduction.

806,35046815,"Impact of a Collaborative Pharmaceutical Care Service for Patients With Parkinson's Disease.  Objective: To identify the impact of a collaborative pharmaceutical care service (CPCS) on medication safety and establish the impact of the CPCS on patient reported outcomes for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Methods: Initially, PD outpatients receiving the CPCS between March 2017 and March 2019 were compared with PD patients receiving standard of care to identify differences in management. Pharmacist interventions data were coded and patients with PD receiving the CPCS were compared with those receiving standard of care to determine differences in medicines prescribed and dosage associated with these. Following this, data of patients receiving CPCS at baseline and 3-months follow-up were collected using a questionnaire consisting of validated measures of two patient-reported outcomes [adherence and quality of life (QoL)]. Mean scores for continuous variables were calculated, with descriptive analysis of categorical variables consisting of frequency counts and percentages. Change in adherence score before and after CPCS was investigated using a Wilcoxon sign rank sum test, spearman correlation analysis was used to correlate the changes in QoL before and after CPCS with the number of interventions, and p < 0.05 indicates that the difference is statistically significant. Results: A total of 331 PD outpatients received CPCS over 490 outpatient visits with an average age of 71.83 (±12.54). Five hundred and forty-five drug related problems were recorded as pharmacist interventions, of which most involved change to dosage (n = 226, 41.47%), adverse drug reactions (n = 135, 24.77%), and change in a medication (n = 102, 18.72%). Compared with those receiving standard of care, patients receiving CPCS were significantly less likely to have been prescribed pramipexole (18.52 versus 23.77%, p < 0.001) and more likely to have been prescribed amantadine (5.40 versus 3.70%, p = 0.02) and selegiline (17.36 versus 11.64%, p < 0.001). Lower dosages of levodopa/benserazide (0.51 ± 0.31 g versus 0.84 ± 0.37 g, p < 0.001), levodopa/carbidopa (0.33 ± 0.23 g versus 0.66 ± 0.47 g, p < 0.001), pramipexole (1.14 ± 1.63 mg versus 1.27 ± 0.69 mg, p = 0.01), and entacapone (130.00 ± 79.76 mg versus 173.09 ± 97.86 mg, p < 0.001) were also recorded. At baseline 119 PD outpatients with an average age of 69.98 (±9.90) were recruited for the longitudinal study. At 3-month follow-up, participants reported improvement in bodily pain subscale (baseline versus 3-months follow-up, 30.04 ± 22.21 versus 23.01 ± 20.98, p = 0.037) and medication adherence (6.19 ± 1.50 versus 6.72 ± 1.73, p = 0.014). Frequency of CPCS use was related to activity of daily living subscale (p = 0.047), the bodily pain subscale (p = 0.026), and medication adherence (p = 0.011). Total score of PDQ-39 was associated with patient education (p = 0.005) and usage and dosage combined with patient education (p = 0.006), while medication adherence score was associated with usage and dosage (p = 0.005). Conclusion: The CPCS was effective in resolving drug-related problems and in improving patients' medication regimens, medication adherence, and QoL through patient education and dosage adjustments.

807,35047377,"Pharmacies in the Airport Ecosystem and How They Serve Travelers' Health and Medicines Need: Findings and Implications for the Future. Introduction Pharmacists at airport pharmacies could offer essential health services for air travelers. Consequently, this study aimed to explore the type of professional services, the types of medicines at airport pharmacies and the pharmacists' experiences and views regarding their practices. Methods A qualitative study was conducted with pharmacists practicing in airport pharmacies from June 2020 to December 2020. A validated Google form-based interview questionnaire was developed, and the electronic link was sent to the participants. Recruitment of participants was continued until data saturation was achieved. In total, 15 pharmacists working at different airport pharmacies in different countries were included. Thematic analysis was used in the data analysis. Results The study identified six major themes including type of professional services and medicines at airport pharmacies, pharmacists' experiences, challenges at the airport pharmacy, suggestions to improve airport pharmacy services, pandemics and the role of pharmacists, and business aspect of the airport pharmacies. The study showed that several professional services provided at airport pharmacies, including the provision of medicines, health products, general health services, travel health services, and counseling. Moreover, 46.7% of the participants reported having a dedicated travel health service. In addition, most of the participants described their experience at airport pharmacies as good and exciting as they met different people from different countries. The most common challenges that pharmacists face at airport pharmacies include language barriers, requests for different medicine brands by travelers, and financial issues. The participants indicated that there is a need for promotion of pharmacists' role in providing health care services at airport pharmacies.

808,35047896,"Digital Medication Adherence Support: Could Healthcare Providers Recommend Mobile Health Apps?  Adherence to prescribed medication is suboptimal in 50% of the chronic population, resulting in negative medical and economic outcomes. With the widespread use of mobile phones worldwide, medication adherence apps for mobile phones become promising medication adherence aids thanks to simplicity, user-friendliness, and accessibility for the public. Yet, until today, there is insufficient evidence in favor of using mobile health (mHealth) apps to increase medication adherence. This study aims to develop a methodology for scientific and end-user (patient) mHealth evaluation (a) to identify medication adherence apps search terms, (b) to evaluate identified apps based on scientific criteria, and (c) to report best smartphone apps evaluated by patients. Search terms were identified via literature review and expertise. Firstly, an online questionnaire was developed to identify frequently used search terms by recruited patients. Related medication adherence apps were identified and selected using predefined inclusion criteria. Secondly, identified apps were evaluated thanks to a scientific evaluation method and a created online questionnaire for patient feedback. Recruited patients were invited to test and evaluate the selected apps. Out of 1,833 free-of-charge and 307 paid apps identified, only four free-of-charge and three paid apps remained included in the study after eligibility criteria. None of the selected app reached a high score. Looking at the overall scores, Medisafe (59%), MyTherapy (56%), and Meds on time (44%) received the highest scores in the scientific app evaluation. In the patient evaluation, Dosecast (3.83 out of five points), Medisafe (3.62), and SwissMeds (3.50) received the highest scores. None of the apps in this research has undergone a process for certification, for example, CE marking, through a notified body. Security and data protection aspects of existing apps highly contribute to these low evaluation scores through little information on patient's data processing and storage. This might be corrected through the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area (EEA) and more scrutiny through regulatory bodies in the EU/EEA and the USA. None of the applications should be recommended by healthcare providers. In addition, clinical studies with chronic patients are necessary to measure long-term app impacts.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND In this study, an intensive review of pharmaceutical care for elderly patients was conducted in a Veterans Administration nursing home in Taiwan and its effects were evaluated. METHODS One hundred participants were enrolled in this randomized controlled study with even distribution. The inclusion criteria were age 65 years or older, prescriptions for at least 5 oral medicines daily, and ≥2 chronic diseases, for the period May 2013 to October 2014. Subjects were excluded if they had previously been included in an intensive medication review conducted by a pharmacist. The primary outcomes were numbers of drugs prescribed, potential inappropriate medications, and numbers of drug-related problems. The secondary outcomes were self-reported medical usages, measurements of quality of life, results of a satisfaction survey, and health status. RESULTS A total of 80 cases (42 in the intervention group with medication reconciliation and 38 in the control group without medication reconciliation) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were not statistically different between the 2 groups. The overall prevalence of potential inappropriate medication was 74.3%. There were no differences between the 2 groups, with the exception of ""medical problems,"" which showed a significantly higher prevalence in the intervention group (P < .05). The intervention group reported greater satisfaction regarding pharmacist visits and medication compliance (P < .01). The mean number of drug-related problems was significantly lower after the intervention (P < .01). CONCLUSION In this study, the intensive review of the elderly patients' medications revealed that the only significant effect of pharmaceutical care was on ""all outcomes."" A possible reason for this is the rather advanced ages of some patients who needed a considerable number of medications to treat several chronic diseases. Another reason may be the small sample size. However, participants who received the pharmacist intervention did have higher satisfaction with medication reconciliation and fewer drug-related problems.",0,0,1,1,1,Reviewer 1 initially did not see that quality of life was evaluated.,Study,,,Geriatric,,,,Nursing home,

BACKGROUND Adverse events are a major threat to any immunization programs, which in turn have proven to be a boon for developing nations like India. Hindering factors, such as inadequate knowledge, inappropriate attitude, incorrect practices, etc., of the guardian affect the vaccination rate. AIM This study aims to assess the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist intervention on an adverse event following immunization in the pediatric population receiving immunization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pediatric subjects <5 yrs of both genders receiving immunization in a tertiary care hospital during the period of 8 months were considered. Subjects were randomized into control and interventional groups. Pharmaceutical intervention was done in interventional group in the form of patient counselling, and a patient information leaflet. Adverse event following immunization was recorded and analysed for both groups along with Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice scores of guardians' pre and post intervention through customized data collection forms. Microsoft excel and statistical software SPSS IBM version 22 was used to analyse the data. RESULTS The study was conducted on a total of 88 subjects (n) in which 79 were <2 years, 1 and 8 were between 2-4 years and 4-5 years respectively. 49 Forty-ninesubjects (55.69%) were female, while 39 were male (44.31%) with a response and completion rate of 91.66%. 97.7% subjects received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination (majority), while 8.88% received pneumococcal special vaccine (minority). Adverse event following immunization was recorded in 31(35.22%) cases. Knowledge, Attitude and Practice scores increased by 42.17%, 52% and 12.67%, respectively in guardians after clinical pharmacist intervention.

811,35049519,"Pharmaceutical interventions in the emergency department: cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. OBJECTIVE It has been shown that pharmacists, as members of multidisciplinary patient care teams, can decrease the number of medicine errors. The objective of the present study was to analyse pharmaceutical interventions (PI) in emergency departments, to assess their clinical relevance, the cost-effectiveness and the potential economic benefits. METHODS We designed a 5-month observational prospective study of PI in the emergency department (ED) of a 330-bed hospital in Spain. We analysed PI made by a pharmacist during a period of 3 hours a day from Monday to Friday in the ED, and classified detected medication errors according to their relevance and severity using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) severity index, and whether or not the drug involved was on the High-Alert Medications Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) list. We used statistical analysis to study the relationship between the relevance of PI and age, gender, the number of interventions per patient, and whether or not the drug was on the High-Alert Medications ISMP list. We also estimated the incremental cost incurred for each PI (cost-effectiveness) and the potential economic benefits (cost-benefit). RESULTS A total of 529 interventions for 390 patients (median age 72.7±8.6 years, 53.1% women) were performed during the study period, representing 1.4 interventions per patient with an acceptance rate of 84.9%. Of all potential medication errors, 112 (21.2%) were related to drugs on the High-Alert Medications ISMP list, and using the NCC MERP severity index, we found that 150 (28.3%) of those errors could cause harm. We also found a relationship between patients on high-risk medications according to the ISMP and the relevance of PI. Finally, this study showed an incremental cost for each PI of 20.23 Euros and a cost-benefit ratio of 3.46 Euros per intervention. CONCLUSION These results show that clinical pharmacist can positively identify and reduce medication errors and costs associated, considering the number of interventions observed and those of clinical relevance. Based on these results, drug safety therapy in the ED can be improved by the revision of prescriptions by a clinical pharmacist.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND The impact of a multi-interventional approach for medication safety (MIMS) on rehospitalization rate have been inconstant in the literature. This would be due to difficulty in implementing the interventions and insufficient information transmission at discharge. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a MIMS on the 30-day rehospitalization rate after discharge from an acute geriatric unit (AGU). METHOD This was a single-center interventional randomized controlled trial that included patients hospitalized in an AGU and were at least 75 years old. The intervention group benefited from a MIMS including medication reconciliation at admission and at discharge, medication review, and standardized transmission of hospital's medication changes sent to community practitioners (general practitioners and pharmacists) at discharge. The control group benefited from the usual approach applied in the AGU. RESULTS One hundred nine patients (mean age 87,5±6,1 years) were included. At intention-totreat analysis, the rehospitalization rate was 30% in the intervention group and 15,2% in the control group. The difference was non-significant before and after adjustments (P=0,27 and 0,28 respectively). However, the intervention protocol was not effectively completed in 40% of patients in the intervention group and no intervention was performed in 10%. CONCLUSION The implementation of a MIMS in an AGU showed a non-significant decrease in the number of rehospitalizations.

Fenugreek seed mucilage (FSM) was extracted from Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds. F1-F9 formulations of pH-responsive hydrogels were prepared using various FSM ratios, methacrylic acid (MAA), and methylene bis acrylamide (MBA) via free radical polymerization technique. Swelling behavior and in vitro drug release studies of prepared hydrogels were evaluated. Toxicity studies of prepared hydrogels were performed on normal cells and on Wistar rats (n = 6). Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetics parameters were studied on albino rabbits. Hydrogels formation was confirmed by FTIR analysis, thermal analysis and SEM studies. The maximum swelling of hydrogel was found to be 384.7% at pH 7.4. MTX-loaded hydrogel showed the controlled release of MTX up to 24 h following Super Case II transport. Prepared hydrogels exhibited no toxicity in normal cells as well as in experimental subjects. MTX loaded hydrogels exhibited less inhibition compared to free MTX on Hela cells. In Vivo studies revealed 7.5-fold improved oral bioavailability of MTX with higher Cmax (928 ng/mL).

PURPOSE Opportunistic pharmacy-based screening of atrial fibrillation (AF) appears effective, but the proportion of detected citizens is unknown. The aim of our real-life study was to determine rates of screening in a community population according to age group and gender. METHODS We conducted four community campaigns of pharmacy-based single-time point AF screening that involved individuals ≥65 years. We used a single-lead and hand-held device MyDiagnostick (6229 EV Maastricht, The Netherlands) that generates a 60-s ECG trace. All pharmacies of the communities (n = 54) were involved. Rates of screening were assessed on the base of the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies data and were expressed as percentage and 95% Confidence interval (CI). RESULTS We screened 4208 individuals (Mean age, 74.2 ± 6.6 years; females, 60.2%). The screening rate in citizens aged ≥65 years was 17.2% (16.6-17.7), and higher in females than in males (17.9% [17.3-18.6] versus 16.0 [15.3-16.8], p < 0.001). The 70-74 age group showed the highest rate (25.7% [24.4-27]) compared to other groups. After 74 years, screening rates decreased steadily with age and dropped to 4.8% [3.8-6.1] in very elderly (≥90). Among the 188 (4.47%) positive screening, 117 (2.78%) showed an AF that was unknown in 53 (1.26%). Increasing age (OR: 1.05 [1.00-1.09], p = 0.04), male sex (OR: 4.30 [2.33-7.92], p < 0.0001) and high CHA2DS2-Vasc (OR: 1.59 [1.21-2.09], p = 0.0008) were independent predictors of unknown AF. CONCLUSION Single-lead AF detection performed in community pharmacies result in screening one in six elderly citizens. Although male sex and elderly predicted unknown AF diagnosis, they were less involved in such designed campaigns.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
817,35052310,"Sleep Medication in Older Adults: Identifying the Need for Support by a Community Pharmacist.  Many older adults take benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics for the treatment of sleep disorders. With a view to considering the possible discontinuation of hypnotics, the objectives of the present study were to describe bedtime habits and sleep patterns in older adults and to identify the sleep medications taken. An expert group developed a structured interview guide for assessing the patients' bedtime habits, sleep patterns, and medications. During an internship in a community pharmacy, 103 sixth-year pharmacy students conducted around 10 interviews each with older adults (aged 65 or over) complaining of sleep disorders and taking at least one of the following medications: benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine derivatives (""Z-drugs""), antihistamines, and melatonin. A prospective, observational study was carried out from 4 January to 30 June 2016. The pharmacy students performed 960 interviews (with 330 men and 630 women; mean ± standard deviation age: 75.1 ± 8.8). The most commonly taken hypnotics were the Z-drugs zolpidem (n = 465, 48%) and zopiclone (n = 259, 27%). The vast majority of patients (n = 768, 80%) had only ever taken a single hypnotic medication. The median [interquartile range] prescription duration was 120 (48-180) months. About 75% (n = 696) of the patients had at least 1 poor sleep habit, and over 41% (n = 374) had 2 or more poor sleep habits. A total of 742 of the patients (77%) reported getting up at night-mainly due to nycturia (n = 481, 51%). Further, 330 of the patients (35%) stated that they were keen to discontinue their medication, of which 96 (29%) authorized the pharmacist to contact their family physician and discuss discontinuation. In France, pharmacy students and supervising community pharmacists can identify problems related to sleep disorders by asking simple questions about the patient's sleep patterns. Together with family physicians, community pharmacists can encourage patients to discuss their hypnotic medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant problem in global health today, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where antimicrobial stewardship programmes are yet to be successfully implemented. We established a partnership between AMR pharmacists from a UK NHS hospital and in Ho Teaching Hospital with the aim of enhancing antimicrobial stewardship knowledge and practice among healthcare providers through an educational intervention. We employed a mixed-method approach that included an initial survey on knowledge and awareness before and after training, followed by qualitative interviews with healthcare providers conducted six months after delivery of training. This study was carried out in two phases in Ho Teaching Hospital with healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, medical doctors, nurses and medical laboratory scientists. Ethical approval was obtained prior to data collection. In the first phase, we surveyed 50 healthcare providers, including nurses (33%), pharmacists (29%) and biomedical scientists (23%). Of these, 58% of participants had engaged in continuous professional development on AMR/AMS, and above 95% demonstrated good knowledge on the general use of antibiotics. A total of 18 participants, which included four medical doctors, five pharmacists, four nurses, two midwives and three biomedical scientists, were interviewed in the second phase and demonstrated greater awareness of AMS practices, particularly the role of education for patients, as well as healthcare professionals. We found that knowledge and practice with AMS was markedly improved six months after the training session. There is limited practice of AMS in LMICs; however, through AMR-focused training, we demonstrated improved AMS skills and practice among healthcare providers in Ho Teaching Hospital. There is a need for continuous AMR training sessions for healthcare professionals in resource-limited settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Three percent sodium chloride (3% NaCl) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic hyponatremia. A barrier to the use of 3% NaCl is the perceived risk of both local infusion reactions and neurologic complications from overcorrection. We examine whether children's hospital pharmacies have policies or practice guidelines for the administration of 3% NaCl and whether these pharmacies have restrictions on the administration of 3% NaCl in terms of rate, route, volume and setting. An Internet survey was distributed to the pharmacy directors of 43 children's hospitals participating in the Children's Hospital Association (CHA) network. The response rate was 65% (28/43). Ninety-three percent (26/28) of pharmacy directors reported a restriction for the administration of 3% NaCl, with 57% restricting its use through a peripheral vein or in a non-intensive care unit setting, 68% restricting the rate of administration and 54% restricting the volume of administration. Seventy-one percent (20/28) reported having written policy or practice guidelines. Only 32% of hospital pharmacies allowed 3% NaCl to be administered through a peripheral IV in a non-intensive care unit setting. The majority of children's hospital pharmacies have restrictions on the administration of 3% NaCl. These restrictions could prevent the timely administration of 3% NaCl in children with symptomatic hyponatremia.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
820,35055762,"Exploration of Estimated Emigration Trends of Polish Health Professionals. BACKGROUND Due to the significant staff shortages, emigration of health professionals is one of the key challenges for many healthcare systems. OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to explore the estimated trends and directions of emigration among Polish health professionals. METHODS The emigration phenomenon of Polish health professionals is still under-researched and the number of studies in this field is limited. Thus, the authors have triangulated data using two methods: a data analysis of five national registers maintained by chambers of professionals (doctors, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, pharmacists, and laboratory diagnosticians), and data analysis from the Regulated Profession Database in The EU Single Market. RESULTS According to the data from national registers, between 7-9% of practicing doctors and nurses have applied for certificates, which confirm their right to practice their profession in other European countries (most often the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Spain, and Ireland). The relatively high number of such certificates applied for by physiotherapists is also worrying. Emigration among pharmacists and laboratory diagnosticians is rather marginal. CONCLUSIONS Urgent implementation of an effective mechanism for monitoring emigration trends is necessary. Furthermore, it is not possible to retain qualified professionals without systemic improvement of working conditions within the Polish healthcare system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
821,35056322,"Glycemic Control and Management in Pharmacist-Led Diabetic Clinic vs. Physician-Led Diabetic Clinic.  Background and Objectives: Globally, diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a life-threatening disease that, if it remains uncontrolled, can lead to mortality or serious complications. Despite the noticeable benefits of clinical pharmacist in managing diabetes, some institutions in Saudi Arabia are reluctant to establish a pharmacist-led diabetic clinic for monitoring and follow-up. The objective of this study is to assess the glycemic control by comparing the reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) percentage between patients followed in the pharmacist-led diabetic clinics vs. those followed in physician-led diabetic clinics. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study with a 12-month follow-up were used to detect the difference in the glycemic control by comparing the reduction in HbA1c percentage from the baseline, and average changes in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure (BP), and lipid panel between the two groups. The level of self-care was assessed by Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) Questionnaire. Results: The study involved 52 patients who visited the diabetic clinic at a community teaching hospital. Exactly 24 patients were followed by the pharmacist-led diabetic clinics, while 28 were followed by physician-led diabetic clinics. HbA1c baseline was 8.7% and 8.4% for pharmacist and physician, respectively. The average difference in HbA1c for the pharmacist-led diabetic clinics vs. the physician-led diabetic clinics was not statistically significant (8.67 vs. 8.56; p = 0.77). Moreover, no difference in the glucose profile, lipid panel, and blood pressure were seen between the two groups. However, the median HbA1c change from baseline between the two groups significantly favored the pharmacist-led clinic (0.7 vs. 0.003; p = 0.04).The average of responses in all four aspects of the SDSCA (diet, exercise, blood sugar testing, and foot care) was also higher among patients in the pharmacist-led diabetic clinic. Conclusions: Pharmacist-led diabetic clinics for glycemic control and follow-up showed efficient results that encourage the comprehensive and integral inter-professional patient care.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
822,35056999,"Delta T, a Useful Indicator for Pharmacy Dispensing Data to Monitor Medication Adherence. INTRODUCTION Calculating patients' medication availability from dispensing or refill data is a common method to estimate adherence. The most often used measures, such as the medication possession ratio (MPR), average medication supplies over an arbitrary period. Averaging masks the variability of refill behavior over time. GOAL To derive a new absolute adherence estimate from dispensing data. METHOD Dispensing histories of patients with 19 refills of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2017 were extracted from 39 community pharmacies in Switzerland. The difference between the calculated and effective refill day (ΔT) was determined for each refill event. We graphed ΔT and its dichotomized version (dΔT) against the MPR, calculated mean ΔT and mean dΔT per refill, and applied cluster analysis. RESULTS We characterized 2204 refill events from 116 DOAC patients. MPR was high (0.975 ± 0.129) and showed a positive correlation with mean ΔT. Refills occurred on average 17.8 ± 27.9 days ""too early"", with a mean of 75.8 ± 20.2 refills being ""on time"". Four refill behavior patterns were identified including constant gaps within or at the end of the observation period, which were critical. CONCLUSION We introduce a new absolute adherence estimate ΔT that characterizes every refill event and shows that the refill behavior of DOAC patients is dynamic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate a peer-led tutoring program to assist students in academic difficulty in the didactic curriculum across multiple courses using one-on-one and large group peer-led sessions, and to evaluate the academic performance and perceptions of students in this program.Methods. This study involved student pharmacists in their second through fourth professional year (P2 - P4) who served as tutors, and P1 - P3 tutees. Tutoring was offered in multiple didactic courses using one-on-one and large group peer-led sessions. Didactic curriculum completion rates and perceptions of the program were assessed.Results. A total of 463(47%) P1 - P3 student pharmacists utilized the one-on-one or large group peer-led tutoring services in 28 courses across four academic years. Tutored students had a lower grade distribution compared to non-tutored students suggesting a more at-risk group for academic failures and dismissals. Despite this, the didactic curriculum completion rate was comparable between tutored and the non-tutored students during the study period, suggesting a benefit of the program in reducing academic dismissals of the at-risk tutored students. On the perceptions survey, 95% of respondents felt they improved their study habits and 92% felt more confident in their ability to succeed.Conclusion. This peer-led tutoring program appeared to be successful in providing comparable didactic curriculum completion rates of tutored students who were an at-risk group for academic failures and dismissals compared with non-tutored students. The tutoring program structure and design may be a useful tool for other colleges of pharmacy as they seek ways to assist students.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
825,35058977,"Impact of COVID-19 on the 937 Telephone Medical Consultation Service in Saudi Arabia.  The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare services has been profound. One major impact has been underutilization of traditional healthcare services by patients. In 2020, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) started offering general COVID-19 enquiries, education, and medical and psychological consultations around the clock via their 937-Call Center. Given this major change, there was a need to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Call Center services, specifically medical consultations, to suggest future recommendations for patient care optimization. This descriptive study analyzed routinely collected data on the 937-Call Center service between March 2020 and September 2020. Data were reviewed, coded, verified, and analyzed using SPSS v22. There was a 296% increase in the number of calls received by the 937-Call Center in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The majority of calls received in 2020 were general medical enquiries (98.41%), but about three million COVID-19-specific enquiries were also received in 2020. The increased number of calls was managed by accepting volunteers to handle calls: an average of 236 volunteers per month, handling about 20% of the total call volume. The majority of volunteers were physicians but with the presence of pharmacists, psychologists, and specialized healthcare workers such as nutritionists. Utilization of the 937-Call Center increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that it has been an effective strategy for combatting the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND Systematically registering ADRs in electronic health records (EHRs) likely contribute to patient safety as it enables the exchange of drug safety data. Currently, ADRs registrations by healthcare professionals (HCPs) is suboptimal. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by HCPs to register ADRs systematically in EHRs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A qualitative study with individual interviews was conducted among specialist physicians and hospital pharmacists from 10 different Dutch hospitals. A semi-structured interview guide was used to identify experienced barriers and facilitators for systematically registering ADRs. Data was analysed following thematic analysis. Themes within barriers and facilitators were aligned with the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework. RESULTS In total, 16 HCPs were interviewed. Identified barriers were: lack of knowledge to recognize ADRs, time constraints, inadequate IT system, lack of support, stuck in routine, and not recognizing the importance of registering ADRs. Identified facilitators were: enhanced knowledge and awareness of ADRs, functional IT systems, expanding accountability for registration, and motivation towards registering. CONCLUSIONS Barriers and facilitators for registering spanned all aspects of the COM-B model and occurred in individual, social and environmental domains. Addressing these aspects could improve the registration of ADRs and may contribute to patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved for the treatment of patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immune globulin, or splenectomy. Dose adjustments of romiplostim are based on platelet counts and follow a dosing schema that requires frequent monitoring. As a quality improvement initiative to increase clinical efficiency and promote clinical pharmacy services at our institution, we developed a collaborative practice agreement and implemented a novel pharmacist-driven romiplostim dosing protocol. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the acceptance, utilization, and impact of the pharmacist-driven romiplostim dosing service. The primary outcome of our analysis was the adoption rate by providers of the romiplostim pharmacist dosing service. Secondary endpoints were focused on patients newly initiating romiplostim on the dosing service and included platelet responses and number of dose adjustments by a pharmacist. RESULTS A total of 54 patients received romiplostim in our analysis: 25 patients who had already been receiving romiplostim and 29 patients who newly initiated romiplostim during the study period. Of the 29 patients newly initiating romiplostim, 27 (93%) had their dosing managed by a pharmacist Twenty-one patients (84%) and 18 patients (75%) achieved an initial and durable response with romiplostim, respectively.

830,35062092,"ABiMed: Towards an Innovative Clinical Decision Support System for Medication Reviews and Polypharmacy Management.  Polypharmacy in elderly is a public health problem with both clinical (increase of adverse drug events) and economic issues. One solution is medication review, a structured assessment of patients' drug orders by the pharmacist for optimizing the therapy. However, this task is tedious, cognitively complex and error-prone, and only a few clinical decision support systems have been proposed for supporting it. Existing systems are either rule-based systems implementing guidelines, or documentary systems presenting drug knowledge. In this paper, we present the ABiMed research project, and, through literature reviews and brainstorming, we identified five candidate innovations for a decision support system for medication review: patient data transfer from GP to pharmacists, use of semantic technologies, association of rule-based and documentary approaches, use of machine learning, and a two-way discussion between pharmacist and GP after the medication review.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to assess the acceptance level of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers (HCW) and the general population in Poland at the start of the national COVID-19 vaccination program from 18-31 December 2020. A cross-sectional anonymous survey was conducted in a group of 1976 people: 1042 health professionals and 934 non-medical professionals using an on-line questionnaire. The most skeptical about the COVID-19 vaccine were students of non-medical faculties, non-medical professions, and administrative-technical health service staff (26.2%, 38.7% and 41.2%, respectively). The most positive attitude to vaccination was reported by doctors, medical students and pharmacists (80.6%, 76.9% and 65.7%, respectively). Doctors (64.7%) and medical students (63.7%) most often declared confidence in vaccines compared to nurses (34.5%). Distrust about vaccine safety was declared by nurses (46.6%) and pharmacists (40.0%). HCW encouraged others to vaccinate more eagerly (65.8%) than non-medical professions (28.3%). Thus, a considerable proportion of HCW in Poland expressed concern about vaccines just prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 immunization program.

The uptake of maternal influenza and pertussis vaccinations is often suboptimal. This study explores the factors influencing pregnant women's and health care professionals' (HCPs) behaviour regarding maternal vaccinations (MVs). Pregnant/recently pregnant women, midwives, pharmacists and general practice staff in Waikato, New Zealand, were interviewed. The analysis used the behaviour change wheel model. Interviews of 18 women and 35 HCPs revealed knowledge about MVs varied with knowledge deficiencies hindering the uptake, particularly for influenza vaccination. HCPs, especially midwives, were key in raising women's awareness of MVs. Experience with vaccinating, hospital work (for midwives) and training increased HCPs' knowledge and proactivity about MVs. A ""woman's choice"" philosophy saw midwives typically encouraging women to seek information and make their own decision. Women's decisions were generally based on knowledge, beliefs, HCPs' emphasis and their perceived risk, with little apparent influence from friends, family, or online or promotional material. General practice's concentration on children's vaccination and minimal antenatal contact limited proactivity with MVs. Busyness and prioritisation appeared to affect HCPs' proactivity. Multi-pronged interventions targeting HCPs and pregnant women and increasing MV access are needed. All HCPs seeing pregnant women should be well-informed about MVs, including how to identify and address women's questions or concerns about MVs to optimise uptake.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Community pharmacists can play an important role in helping patients who live in food deserts through screening, adjusting therapeutic recommendations and counseling practices, and making referrals to community resources. However, literature regarding community pharmacists' knowledge, practices, and attitudes regarding food deserts is scant. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to assess Ohio community pharmacists' knowledge regarding food deserts. Secondary objectives included determining their attitudes, practices, and perceived barriers related to this topic. METHODS An anonymous 26-question survey was created and distributed to a random sample of 500 licensed community pharmacists in Ohio. Participants were granted 3 weeks to complete the survey and were offered a link to free Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education-approved continuing pharmacy education as an incentive. The survey was deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board. RESULTS The survey was successfully delivered to 491 pharmacists; 72 participated (14.7% response rate). About 43% of respondents were familiar with the term ""food desert,"" and less than one-third (31.9%) reported being aware of community resources. Of those who thought that some of their patients lived in food deserts, the majority indicated that they did not consider it in patient interactions (65.1%) and ""never"" adjusted their counseling practices (65.1%). Barriers that prevented them from referring patients included lack of knowledge and confidence as well as workflow constraints. About 68% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that pharmacists could help patients living in food deserts, and 65.3% were interested in learning more information about food deserts. CONCLUSION Deficiencies in knowledge regarding food deserts and available resources were found among Ohio community pharmacists, but they showed interest in learning more information.

BACKGROUND Healthcare is not as safe as it should be and medication error remains a significant source of preventable morbidity and mortality among patients. OBJECTIVES To present a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) of the medication management process in the pharmacy of the largest teaching hospital in Tunisia. Secondly, to examine the validity of a proposed simplified risk rating method by comparing the degree of concordance with the FMEA rating system in classifying failure modes related to the studied process. METHODS The FMEA method was applied to the medication management process in the pharmacy for 5 months from January 2020. For the traditional FMEA rating system, failure modes were prioritised according to the risk priority number, which considers severity, occurrence and non-detectability. Failure modes were classified for the traditional method considering three categories: accepted, requiring control and critical. The proposed rating system was based on two indices: the number of parts, which reflected severity, and the number of causes according to the 5M method (manpower, machines, material, methods and medium), which reflected occurrence. Failure modes were classified for the proposed method considering three categories: low, medium and high. Failure modes were independently analysed to determine the degree of agreement in ranking of risk between the two studied methods. Prioritised failure modes were targeted by decisions and solutions aiming to reduce risk and enhance safety. RESULTS Twenty-four failure modes were identified for the six-step process of medication management in a pharmacy (overall criticality=2607). The most critical failure modes were: data error in drugs reception (risk priority number (RPN)=432), break in the cold chain (RPN=320) and non-optimal pharmaceutical analysis (RPN=280). A good agreement was found between the classic FMEA and the proposed rating methods (κ=0.795). A high correlation was shown between the two scorings (r=0.785). Three failure modes were underestimated by the proposed rating method. CONCLUSIONS An FMEA study on the medication management process in a teaching pharmacy showed that FMEA is an effective, proactive risk assessment that enables a better understanding of the studied process. The proposed risk scoring permits a good concordance with the classic method, with the advantage of being fast. Targeting the identified risks will allow integration into a continuous process of improvement and increase patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
837,35064396,"Identification and evaluation of medication-related issues relating to patient's own drugs by pharmacy students while on placement in a tertiary hospital.  Background Pharmacy students require knowledge of prescribing and supply of medicines; this is achievable through work-based learning. In UK hospitals, pharmacy technicians assess patient's own drugs (PODs) so medicines can be used as they would be at home. Student-led POD checks have not yet been considered as an opportunity for legitimate peripheral participation (LPP). Aim To evaluate an undergraduate pharmacy placement model using POD checking as a way of gaining LPP within a UK tertiary hospital. Method Students (n = 100) attended nine placements over academic year 2020-2021; they were supervised by a pharmacy technician to complete POD checks. Data were collected concerning student activities and resulting medication-related issues (MRIs); data were descriptively analysed. Results 1094 patients were seen by pharmacy students and 296 MRIs identified. Omitted (non-prescribed) medicines were the most common MRI (32.1%), followed by incorrect stock items (16.2%). Most MRIs were medium risk (65.5%). The most common actions/outcomes were handover to another ward member (41.6%) or medication removal (25.3%). Conclusion Clinically relevant MRIs relating to PODs can be identified by pharmacy students while experiencing LPP. These activities illustrate scalable work-based learning where pharmacy students can contribute to patient care in relation to the use and supply of medicines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes include actions to improve antibiotic use. OBJECTIVE To identify factors of AMS interventions associated with behaviour change towards antibiotic use in hospitals, applying behavioural sciences. DATA SOURCES The following online databases were searched: PubMed and Scopus. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies published between January 2015 and December 2020. Outcomes required were: effect of the intervention reported in terms of antibiotic consumption, antibiotic costs, appropriateness of prescription, duration of therapy, proportion of patients treated with antibiotics, or time to appropriate antibiotic therapy. PARTICIPANTS Healthcare professionals involved in antibiotic prescription and use in hospitals, and patients receiving or susceptible to receive antibiotics. INTERVENTIONS Studies investigating AMS interventions in hospitals. ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF BIAS Risk of bias was determined using the ""Integrated quality criteria for review of multiple study designs"" (ICROMS) tool. METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS Systematic review of AMS interventions, using ""Behaviour Change Wheel"" to identify behaviour changes functions of interventions, and ""Action, actor, context, target, time (AACTT)"" framework to describe how they are implemented. Relationships between intervention functions and AACTT domains were explored to deduce factors for optimal implementation. RESULTS Among the 124 studies reporting 123 interventions, 64% were effective in reducing antibiotic use or improving quality of antibiotic prescription. 91% of the studies had high risk of bias. Main functions retrieved in effective interventions were enablement, environmental restructuring, and education. The most common subcategories were audit and feedback and real-time recommendation for enablement function; and material resources, human resources, and new task for environmental restructuring function. Most AMS interventions focused on prescription, targeted prescribers, and were implemented by pharmacists, infectious diseases specialists, and microbiologists. Interventions focusing on specific clinical situation were effective in 70% of cases.

839,35065513,"Trends in pharmacy-based dispensing of buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, and naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic by age and sex - United States, March 2019 - December 2020. BACKGROUND COVID-19 stay-at-home orders may reduce access to substance use treatment and naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug. The objective of this analysis was to compare monthly trends in pharmacy-based dispensing rates of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (buprenorphine and extended-release [ER] naltrexone) and naloxone in the United States during March 2019-December 2020 by age and sex. METHODS We calculated monthly prescription dispensing rates per 100,000 persons using IQVIA New to Brand. We used Joinpoint regression to calculate monthly percent change in dispensing rates and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to examine differences in median monthly rates overall, and by age and sex between March 2019-December 2019 and March 2020-December 2020. RESULTS Buprenorphine dispensing increased among those aged 40-64 years and ≥ 65 years from March 2019 to December 2020. Median rates of total ER naltrexone dispensing were lower in March 2020-December 2020 compared to March 2019-December 2019 for the total population, and for females and males. From March 2019 to December 2020, ER naltrexone dispensing decreased and naloxone dispensing increased for those aged 20-39 years. CONCLUSIONS Dispensing ER naltrexone declined during the study period. Given the increase in substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining equivalent access to MOUD may not be adequate to accommodate rising numbers of new patients with opioid use disorder. Access to all MOUD and naloxone could be further expanded to meet potential needs during and after the public health emergency, given their importance in preventing opioid overdose-related harms.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
840,35065886,"Vaccination approval literacy and its effects on intention to receive future COVID-19 immunization. BACKGROUND Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine release, polls showed only 50% of Americans had intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine hesitancy may result from a lack of confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. More research is needed to identify whether knowledge of vaccine approval processes relates to vaccination intentions. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate participants' knowledge regarding COVID-19 and vaccine approval processes, (2) evaluate participants' intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and (3) compare participants' knowledge assessment results with COVID-19 vaccine intentions. METHODS A prospective, cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to patients participating in a pharmacist-led chronic disease state management program. The 22-item questionnaire assessed demographic information and evaluated the participant's knowledge and vaccine intentions. Data were analyzed with an a priori alpha value of 0.05. RESULTS Nearly all participants answered correctly on questions pertaining to COVID-19 infection (n = 92, 93%), COVID-19 symptoms (n = 96, 96%), and the Food and Drug Administration's roles in vaccine approval processes (n = 92, 92%). Participants scored lower on questions involving the differing requirements between clinical trial phases (n = 20, 21%) and vaccine safety in the United States (n = 51, 53%). Most participants (n = 54, 55.1%) did not believe the trials were taking too long to produce a vaccine, but 40.4% of the participants (n = 40) believed the vaccine was approved too quickly. More than half of the participants (n = 55, 56.1%) desired more information on how vaccines get approved in the United States. Participants who scored higher on the knowledge assessment were more likely to have a plan to receive the vaccine (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study demonstrate the influence knowledge has on intentions to receive vaccines and may aid health care providers in their attempts to promote vaccinations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

843,35067216,"GP trainee prescribing assessment - a qualitative evaluation of the involvement of pharmacists.  In 2019, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) introduced a mandatory workplace-based prescribing assessment for general practice trainees in their final year of training (GPST3). This assessment aimed to improve the quality of prescribing and reduce prescribing errors and it did not require pharmacist involvement. NHS Education for Scotland (NES) is the education and training body for NHS Scotland: delivering postgraduate training for GP trainees working in NHS Scotland. NES wished to evaluate the role that general practice pharmacists could have in this assessment.A training event for pharmacists was designed and delivered by the researchers in collaboration with the NES pharmacy team. Pharmacists attached to training practices in the West region of Scotland, where a GPST3 was undertaking the prescribing assessment, were invited to attend. The training described the prescribing assessment and the value that pharmacists could add to this workplace-based assessment. The evaluation aimed to explore the role of appropriately trained pharmacists in the prescribing assessment and their feedback to GP trainees, and evaluate the impact pharmacists had by exploring the views of GP trainers, GP trainees and pharmacists.Results showed that the intervention was viewed as a positive educational experience for all participants, and the interprofessional approach broadened the learning experience for GP trainees. We believe this to be innovative work replicable to primary healthcare colleagues to promote prescribing safety and interprofessional learning with pharmacy colleagues.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
844,35067476,"Key informant perspectives about telephonic comprehensive medication review services in the United States. BACKGROUND Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) are provided by providers such as pharmacists to eligible beneficiaries. Although CMRs have been shown to provide value to patients, little is known about the service uniformity, quality, and content of CMRs. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to characterize the current state of CMR services from diverse stakeholder perspectives and describe variation in responses to content and delivery of telephonic CMR services. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 key informants. The interview guide contained 6 key questions with additional probing questions. Transcripts were analyzed using the inductive saturation model and phenomenological approach to code emergent themes, which were iteratively refined until saturation was achieved. RESULTS Key informants included CMR payers (n = 3), providers (n = 5), and standards-setting organizations (n = 2). Ten themes about CMRs emerged from qualitative analysis: (1) definition, (2) organizational goals, (3) content, (4) eligibility, (5) frequency, (6) acceptance and completion, (7) process and personnel, (8) quality assurance, (9) preparation, and (10) future directions. CMR content descriptions were consistent across perspectives. Key informants described scenarios appropriate for expanded CMR eligibility criteria, although none were consistently reported. Providers emphasized patient CMR acceptance rates whereas payers and standard-setting organizations emphasized completion rates. Completion rates and adherence to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services standards were characterized as core organizational goals (n = 8), whereas patient satisfaction was less frequently identified (n = 4). A lack of incentive for CMR providers to follow-up with patients was a barrier to expanded services. Overall, key informants were dissatisfied with the CMR completion rate measure and would prefer measures focused on service quality and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS CMR services largely met perceived guidelines, with variation in value-added services. Key informants desired adoption of an actionable measure that is focused on quality rather than completion rate. To inform a quality measure, future research should analyze completed CMRs to determine the extent of variation in content and delivery.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
845,35067477,"Trends in telephonic comprehensive medication review in the United States from 2000 to present: a scoping literature review. BACKGROUND Although comprehensive medication review (CMR) services have been shown to provide value to patients and payers, the extent of uniformity in service delivery is unknown. A variety of standards and recommendations are available from academic and professional sources, but variation in service provision is an important consideration when attempting to measure or compare service quality nationally. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify and summarize trends in the peer-reviewed and gray literature describing telephonic CMR delivery and content. METHODS A scoping review of peer-reviewed and gray literature was conducted to quantify and qualify trends in CMR service. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts from 9 bibliographic databases and selected gray literature sources in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and an internally developed protocol. Inclusion criteria for the review were English language; discussion of telephonic CMR service in the United States; research, legislation, or guidelines that describe CMR content coverage requirements for payment; and publication from the year 2000 to the present. Data relating to publication type, study design, setting, region, and themes of CMR content were collated into a Microsoft Excel data extraction form. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted, and key findings and concepts were reported contextually. RESULTS Of 374 identified documents screened, 15 were included in this scoping review and thematic analysis. The following characteristics of CMRs were identified: content, coverage, eligibility, frequency, process, and responsiveness. All published documents (n = 15, 100%) included a discussion of CMR content, and 14 sources (93%) addressed process elements of providing a CMR. Discussion of other themes varied in frequency across documents, ranging from 3 articles (20%) addressing organizational goals for CMR to 12 articles (80%) including elements of responsiveness. Within-theme variation was also observed for several CMR content areas. CMR process was the most heterogeneous theme with topics ranging from access to patient health records to pharmacist training. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of telephonic CMR comprised a small but steadily increasing portion of the medication therapy management literature. Publications since 2015 have shown an increasing consensus of CMR content and purpose. Per the identified literature, there is an ongoing demand for higher-quality, more holistic CMRs, but there is no consensus on how to measure CMR quality. Future work should include engaging with CMR experts to understand variability in measures of CMR success.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
846,35067857,"Will the Public Engage with New Pharmacy Roles? Assessing Future Uptake of a Community Pharmacy Health Check Using a Discrete Choice Experiment. BACKGROUND Pharmacists are increasingly providing more clinically orientated services that focus on enhancing patient care and health promotion. However, little is known about how acceptable this is to the public. This study explored public preferences for a community pharmacy-based health check for cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS A convenience sample of 423 individuals was recruited (from a community pharmacy, a dental practice, a shopping centre, a university campus and a sports centre) to complete a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey administered face to face on a tablet. The DCE included six attributes: day of the week (weekday or weekends); way of accessing the service (walk-in and wait or by appointment); provider of health check (trainee pharmacist, pharmacist or nurse); duration of health check (30 or 45 min); follow-up phone call (no, yes and within 3 months); and cost (included to estimate the monetary value of health checks). Experimental design methods were used to create 12 choice tasks describing different health check services. Mixed logit (MXL) was used to analyse response data. RESULTS Respondents had a preference for a community pharmacy-based CVD health check over no health check. They preferred a service provided (i) at the weekend; (ii) by appointment; (iii) by a nurse; (iv) for 30 min and (v) with follow-up after 3 months. Respondents were willing to pay £50 for this health check. CONCLUSION Findings affirm the public's acceptance and value of a pharmacy-led CVD health check. The findings can inform pharmacy-based screening services before they are introduced, guide new service design and support resource allocation decisions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
847,35068248,"Improving Organizational Sustainability of an Urban Indian Health Clinic With an Innovative Pharmacy Model. INTRODUCTION To increase access to care for the urban American Indian population, a collaboration was developed between an Urban Indian Health Clinic (UIHC) and Federally Qualified Healthcare Center (FQHC) to reduce financial barriers, increase patient access to affordable medications, and augment the integrated model of care. OBJECTIVE To describe the design and implementation of an innovative pharmacy model through a partnership between an UIHC and a FQHC. METHODS A collaborative partnership between an UIHC and a FQHC was developed to spread scarce 340B federal resources as a method to enhance patient care. The innovative practice model included the development of processes to (1) increase medication access to all patients by providing access to affordable medications at clinic and the provision of mail order services, (2) minimize program expenses through cost-sharing of a pharmacist salary, (3) expand clinical pharmacy programs (collaborative drug therapy management) to augment integrated patient care, and (4) optimize 340B cost savings for the clinic by establishing contracts and implementing adjudication software to obtain medication reimbursement from Medicaid and other third party insurances. RESULTS Through the cost-sharing of a pharmacist salary and use of remote verification, the majority of prescription medications were available to patients at the UIHC through implementation and expansion of an other outlet. Collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) protocols were successfully implemented which allowed clinical pharmacy services to collaboratively manage chronic conditions. All adult primary care providers adopted the integrated patient care model. Third-party pharmacy insurance contracts were obtained and computer software was installed to allow for the adjudication of pharmacy claims, resulting in cost savings from medication reimbursement. CONCLUSION The innovative collaborative partnership between an UIHC and an FQHC demonstrated how scarce federal resources can be leveraged using the 340B program to increase patient access to affordable medications. This innovative model reduced financial barriers to the clinic, and allowed for expansion of pharmacist led CDTM programs and augmentation of integrated clinical services. The cost savings observed from this novel program additionally fueled programmatic sustainability through reinvestment into the pharmacy program and is expected to continue to fund the program in the future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
848,35069205,"Perceptions About Biosimilar Medicines Among Belgian Patients in the Ambulatory Care.  Background and objectives: Biosimilar medicines have been on the European market for 15 years. Despite the extensive and positive experience with biosimilars across Europe, their uptake remains limited in Belgium. One of the possible factors limiting uptake in clinical practice is the inadequate understanding and lack of trust in biosimilars among patients. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge and perceptions about biosimilar medicines among Belgian patients in the ambulatory care. Methods: This study consisted of online questionnaires among Belgian patients in the ambulatory care (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diabetes mellitus type I and II). The results were collected between December 2020 and February 2021. The data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: In total, 657 patients across all disease areas of interest participated in this study. Only 38% of patients had heard of biosimilars before. Of those patients, most (58%) were aware that biosimilars are as safe and effective as their reference product. The vast majority of respondents (68%) would agree with transitioning to a biosimilar if their physician prescribed it, only 3% would never agree with a transition to a biosimilar. If a physician would propose to change their current originator biological therapy with its biosimilar, nearly all patients (95%) want their physician to explain the decision and inform them. For additional information about biosimilars, Belgian patients prefer brochures or folders (41%), or available resources on the internet (35%). Physicians were indicated as the preferred source of information (95%), followed by pharmacists (51%), academia (39%), and patient associations (35%). Most patients require information regarding the safety and efficacy (78%), price and reimbursement (64%), and the clinical development process (56%) of the biosimilar. Conclusion: Belgian patients require information about biosimilar medicines. However, most patients are open and positive towards transitioning their current biological therapy with its biosimilar if sufficiently supported by their healthcare providers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

850,35070309,"A cross-sectional evaluation of knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceived challenges among Palestinian pharmacists regarding COVID-19. Objectives This study aims to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceived challenges regarding coronavirus disease 2019 among pharmacists in Palestine. Methods An online method was used to collect the data. Three hundred sixty-four pharmacists participated in the study from all areas in the Palestinian territories. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: sociodemographics; knowledge, attitudes, practices regarding coronavirus disease 2019; and barriers that prevent the implementation of infection control measures. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program Version 21 was used to analyze the data. Variables were expressed as frequencies, percentages, mean, and median. The chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Pearson's test were applied, along with logistic regression analysis. Results The median age of the participants was 29 years old, and most of them were female (70.9%). The analysis found that 76.4% of pharmacists had good knowledge regarding coronavirus disease 2019, and 52.7% had good practices. The median attitude score recorded by the participants was 32 points [Q1-Q3: 30-34] out of 35. Notably, the level of concern regarding coronavirus disease 2019 was significantly associated with all three tools of measurement; knowledge (p = 0.001), attitudes (p = 0.001), and practices (p = 0.001). It also appears that more years of experience had higher odds (3-5 years of experience: odds ratio, 2.560; 95% confidence interval, 1.413-4.639; p = 0.002, more than 5 years: odds ratio, 2.931; 95% confidence interval, 1.188-7.232; p = 0.020) of good practice. Conclusion Although an acceptable level of knowledge was found, it might be considered inadequate. Moreover, there is a lack of appropriate adherence to safety measures from pharmacists.

851,35070313,"A cross-sectional study of COVID-19-related knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices among pharmacy students in Bangladesh. Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a threat to public health that impacts the life of frontline pharmacists as they are more susceptible to getting infected by the coronavirus. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices associated with coronavirus disease 2019 among pharmacy students of Bangladesh to evaluate their preparedness as future frontline workers against the ongoing pandemic. Methods An online-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pharmacy undergraduate students of Bangladesh during the early months of the pandemic in April 2020. Respondents voluntarily submitted an online questionnaire regarding sociodemographics, knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices related to coronavirus disease 2019. Results A total of 418 participants submitted their responses, and we included 395 responses for final analysis. The mean age of the participants was 20.65 years. The study revealed that out of 395 pharmacy students, 68 (17.2%) had high levels of knowledge, 210 (53.2%) possessed high risk perceptions regarding coronavirus disease 2019, and 165 (41.7%) were adopting high levels of preventive practices. Average scores for knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices were 5.7, 8.4, and 8.2 out of 10. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses showed that having high knowledge levels was associated with high risk perceptions regarding coronavirus disease 2019. Similarly, higher risk perceptions were associated with having high knowledge and preventive measures, while higher preventive measures were associated with female gender, low monthly family income, and having high risk perceptions. Conclusion We found moderate knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices related to coronavirus disease 2019 among the undergraduate pharmacy students. We recommend awareness-building discussions or seminars focusing on pharmacy students. In addition, the upgradation of the existing curriculum may help future pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
852,35071019,"Perspectives and Expertise in Establishing a Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Programme for Challenging Childhood Cancer Patient Populations.  The utility of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in the setting of childhood cancer is a largely underused tool, despite the common use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. While it is encouraging that modern advances in chemotherapy have transformed outcomes for children diagnosed with cancer, this has come at the cost of an elevated risk of life-changing long-term morbidity and late effects. This concern can limit the intensity at which these drugs are used. Widely used chemotherapeutics exhibit marked inter-patient variability in drug exposures following standard dosing, with fine margins between exposures resulting in toxicity and those resulting in potentially suboptimal efficacy, thereby fulfilling criteria widely accepted as fundamental for TDM approaches. Over the past decade in the UK, the paediatric oncology community has increasingly embraced the potential benefits of utilising TDM for particularly challenging patient groups, including infants, anephric patients and those receiving high dose chemotherapy. This has been driven by a desire from paediatric oncologists to have access to clinical pharmacology information to support dosing decisions being made. This provides the potential to modify doses between treatment cycles based on a comprehensive set of clinical information, with individual patient drug exposures being used alongside clinical response and tolerability data to inform dosing for subsequent cycles. The current article provides an overview of recent experiences of conducting TDM in a childhood cancer setting, from the perspectives of the clinicians, scientists and pharmacists implementing TDM-based dosing recommendations. The ongoing programme of work has facilitated investigations into the validity of current approaches to dosing for some of the most challenging childhood cancer patient groups, with TDM approaches now being expanded from well-established cytotoxic drugs through to newer targeted treatments.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background There is a lack of evidence on how the multimodal dynamic process of resilience has impacted personal adaptation of frontline healthcare professionals, working under extreme pressure during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Objectives To explore resilience, burnout and wellbeing for UK pharmacists in patient-facing roles, including individual and organisational factors that align to the ABC-X theoretical model of the dynamic process of resilience. Methods A non-experimental pragmatist research design was adopted, with a cross-sectional online survey distributed via social media and professional networks between June and July 2020. Quantitative data aligned to a positivist research paradigm was collected using validated scores, to statistically analyse wellbeing, burnout and resilience. Qualitative textual data, consistent with an interpretivist research paradigm, were analysed following an inductive thematic approach. Results A total of 199 surveys from pharmacists working within community, hospital and GP sectors were analysed. Wellbeing scores were strongly correlated to resilience scores. Wellbeing and resilience scores were both inversely correlated with burnout scores. Two-thirds of participants were classified as high-risk within the burnout scales.Key stressors were highlighted by participants, who described how individual resources and perceptions shaped their experience, which overall contributed to their burnout. Organisations that supported pharmacists embraced change and quickly adopted new ways of working, such as teleconsultations, flexible and remote working, redesign of workflow, alongside clear guidance. However, there was also reported frustration at lack of, slow or conflicting guidance from employers. Conclusions This study adds to the growing evidence base for how individuals are affected by adverse events in a dynamic environment, alongside the role that employers can play in supporting individual and organisational resilience. It provides an opportunity to learn from pharmacists' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a call to action for healthcare organisations to rebuild and invest resources into sustained support for staff wellbeing.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

856,35073326,"Understanding pharmaceutical care and nurse prescribing in Spain: A grounded theory approach through healthcare professionals' views and expectations. BACKGROUND Pharmaceutical care has been implemented and regulated differently across Europe with no consensus among countries in relation with professional competencies and especially on nurse prescribing. Demophac Project funded by the European Commission aims to develop a Pan-European Pharmaceutical Care Model with collaboration of 14 partner teams across Europe including Spain where nurse prescribing is starting its implementation at regional level. The aim of the study was to increase understanding of the role of nurses in Pharmaceutical care in Spain after the Nurse Prescribing Regulation approved in 2018 throughout exploring the views and expectations of health professionals involved in the representative settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS In depth interviews were conducted in a structure previously agreed by the European Demophac partnership around four topics associated with the Nursing ideal role in pharmaceutical care and the ideal interaction with other healthcare professionals. A grounded-theory approach based on Corbin & Strauss was conducted to interpret collected data from the Spanish most representative settings (primary care, specialized care and residential care for older population). Participants were health professionals involved in pharmaceutical care that accepted to participate (nurses (n = 7), physicians (n = 8) and pharmacists (n = 9)). A pharmaceutical care comprehensive model for the Spanish context considering the recently approved Nurse Prescribing role and the interprofessional collaboration and communication was developed towards facilitating the understanding in such context and the contribution to the unified European Demophac Framework. CONCLUSIONS Nurses are primarily responsible for population's Pharmaceutical Care while other professionals pivot on them to provide quality healthcare on a multidisciplinary level. Nurse prescribing may contribute efficiently to the Spanish Health System though more consensus in terms of nurses' training nationwide and enhancement in communication among different professionals within healthcare organizations is required to achieve adequate integrated care into practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

858,35073999,"Improving bedside dispensing services through early medication discharge planning: a pre-post intervention study. BACKGROUND Delays in producing discharge prescriptions have hindered the provision of bedside dispensing services (BEDISC) that enable medication reconciliation and pharmaceutical intervention, which is an important element in transitional care medication safety. We aimed to assess the impact of early medication discharge planning on the delivery of BEDISC in terms of the rate of bedside dispensing, medication errors, and cost-saving from medication reconciliation by reusing patient's own medicines (POMs). METHODS A pre-post intervention study was conducted at medical wards in a public tertiary hospital. During the intervention phase, a structured bedside dispensing process was delineated and conveyed to the doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. Regular verbal reminders were given to the doctors to prioritize discharge patients by producing the prescriptions once discharge decisions had been made and nurses to hand the prescriptions to ward pharmacists and not patients. Throughout the study, ward pharmacists were involved in medication reconciliation via screening of discharge prescriptions and reusing POMs, performed pharmaceutical interventions for any medication errors detected, and provided bedside dispensing with discharge counseling. Comparisons were made between bedside versus counter-dispensing at pre-post intervention phases using the chi-square test. RESULTS A total of 1097 and 817 discharge prescriptions were dispensed in the pre-intervention and post-intervention phases, respectively. The bedside dispensing rate increased by 13.5% following remedial actions (p < 0.001). The number of prescriptions intervened due to detection of medication errors increased by 13.4% for bedside dispensing (p < 0.001) versus 4.7% for counter-dispensing (p = 0.002), post-intervention. Most medication errors fell under the category of inappropriate drug (44.5%), followed by inappropriate dose (12.8%). Reusing POMs resulted in cost-saving of MYR6,851.66 at pre-intervention and MYR7,032.98 at the post-intervention phase. Overall, the cost-saving from reusing POMs in both intervention phases was 52.7% (MYR13,884.64 out of the total MYR26.367.47), with the majority contributed by respiratory medications (40.2%) followed by cardiovascular (18%) and vitamins/minerals (17.5%).

860,35074813,"Understanding dynamics of private tuberculosis pharmacy market: a qualitative inquiry from a South Indian district. OBJECTIVES In India, retail private pharmacists (RPPs) are often patients' first point of contact for diseases, including tuberculosis (TB). We assessed the factors influencing RPPs' referral of patients with chest symptoms to the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) and the way business is carried out with reference to TB drugs. DESIGN We conducted semistructured interviews with a purposive sample of 41 RPPs in a South Indian district between May and October 2013. Data were collected from urban areas (21 RPPs) and rural areas (20 RPPs) employing the principle of data saturation. Data were analysed thematically using NVivo V.9. RESULTS Knowledge and compliance of RPPs regarding TB symptoms and regulatory requirements were found to be poor. The RPPs routinely dispensed medicines over the counter and less than half of the respondents had pharmacy qualifications. None of them had received TB-related training, yet half of them knew about TB symptoms. Practice of self-referrals was common particularly among economically poorer populations who preferred purchasing medicines over the counter based on RPPs' advice. Inability of patients with TB to purchase the full course of TB drugs was conspicuous. Rural RPPs were more likely to refer patients with TB symptoms to the NTEP compared with urban ones who mostly referred such clients to private practitioners (PPs). Reciprocal relationships between the RPPs, PPs, medical representatives and the prevalence of kickbacks influenced RPPs' drug-stocking patterns. PPs wielded power in this nexus, especially in urban areas. CONCLUSION India hopes to end TB by 2025. Our study findings will help the NTEP to design policy and interventions to engage RPPs in public health initiatives by taking cognisance of symbiotic relationships and power differentials that exist between PPs, RPPs and medical representatives. Concurrently, there should be a strong enforcement mechanism for existing regulatory norms regarding over-the-counter sales and record keeping.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

862,35074852,"Identifying Low Pharmaceutical Calculation Performers Using an Algebra-Based Pretest.  Objective. To determine whether a pretest assessing algebra-based problem-solving skills could aid in identifying those who may underperform in calculations course assessments and whether this provides additional value beyond preadmission and demographic characteristics.Methods. Student pharmacists were screened for algebraic problem-solving skills using an 18-item pretest taken the semester prior to a course containing pharmaceutical calculations content. These scores were compared to students' later performance on pharmaceutical calculations assessments. Linear regression models were computed to determine the relationship between pretest scores and pharmaceutical calculations performance after controlling for preadmission factors and demographic characteristics.Results. The median pretest score was 15 out of 18 possible points, with scores ranging from 5 to 18 points. After controlling for age, gender, American College Testing (ACT) scores, and high school grade point average (GPA), scores on the algebra-based, word-problem pretest were associated with performance on pharmaceutical calculation assessments.Conclusion. This research demonstrates the ability of a pretest aimed at identifying deficiencies in algebraic problem-solving skills to identify those at risk of failing to obtain mastery of pharmaceutical calculations, even after controlling for demographics, prior grades, and prior standardized test scores. Identifying these students is a first step towards implementing tailored interventions to improve students' algebra-based word problem skills to prevent deficiencies in pharmaceutical calculations mastery before class even begins.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the prevalence of impostor phenomenon in student pharmacists and faculty members at two educational institutions in the United States.Methods. Participants anonymously completed an electronic self-report survey instrument that included the validated Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) from April 2020 to May 2020. Demographic data including age range, gender, and other characteristics were collected. The Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale scores were reported as means (SDs), and data were compared between institutions and demographic groups using t tests.Results. The overall mean CIPS survey score (N=209, 35.5% response rate) was 63.8 (SD=15.1). The mean student pharmacist CIPS score for Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED) was 64.7 (SD=14.4) vs 63.8 (SD=16.1) for Sullivan University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (SUCOPHS), which was statistically similar. Mean faculty CIPS score for NEOMED was 59.2 (SD=14.0) vs 64.7 (SD=16.8) for SUCOPHS, which was statistically similar. Mean CIPS score for the combined student pharmacist group (NEOMED and SUCOPHS) was 64.3 (SD=15.1) vs 61.2 (SD=15.1) for the combined group of faculty members, which was statistically similar. Overall, most respondents fell in the ""moderate"" to ""frequent"" CIPS score classification range (36.4% and 44%, respectively).Conclusion. Impostor phenomenon feelings were common among responding student pharmacists and faculty members at the institutions surveyed; however, little is known about the implications of these findings.

New predictors that could boost early detection of preeclampsia (PE) and prognosticate its severity are urgently needed. We examined serum miR-17, miR-363, MALAT-1 and HOTAIR as potential biomarkers of PE risk, onset and severity. This prospective study included 160 pregnant females; 82 PE cases and 78 healthy pregnancies. Serum samples were collected between 20 to 40 weeks of gestation. Early-onset PE was defined as developing clinical manifestations at ≤ 34 gestational weeks. Severe PE was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and proteinuria (≥ 2 g/24 h or ≥ 2+ dipstick). Selection of PE-related non-coding RNAs and functional target gene analysis were conducted using bioinformatics analysis. Expression profiles were assessed by RT-qPCR. Serum miR-363 and MALAT-1 were downregulated, meanwhile miR-17 was upregulated, and HOTAIR was not significantly altered in PE compared with healthy pregnancies. miR-17 was elevated while miR-363 and MALAT-1 were reduced in severe versus mild PE. miR-363 was lower in early-onset versus late-onset PE. MALAT-1, miR-17 and miR-363 showed diagnostic potential and discriminated severe PE, whereas miR-363 distinguished early-onset PE in the receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. miR-363 and MALAT-1 were significantly associated with early and severe PE, respectively in multivariate logistic analysis. In PE, miR-17 and MALAT-1 were significantly correlated with gestational age (r = - 0.328 and r = 0.322, respectively) and albuminuria (r = 0.312, and r = - 0.35, respectively). We constructed the MALAT-1, miR-363, and miR-17-related protein-protein interaction networks linked to PE. Serum miR-17, miR-363 and MALAT-1 could have utility as new biomarkers of PE diagnosis. miR-363 may be associated with early-onset PE and MALAT-1 downregulation correlates with PE severity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Despite harboring a high burden of cancer patients who are at high risk of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs), there is scarcity of published information about pDDIs in cancer patients from Pakistan. OBJECTIVE To evaluate frequency, pattern, mechanism and factors associated with pDDIs in cancer patients treated at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. METHODS In this cross-sectional analytical study, a total of 253 eligible ambulatory cancer patients treated at Center for Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy Hospital Quetta were evaluated for pDDIs using IBM Micromedex® Drug Interactions. SPSS (version 26) was used for conducting multivariate analysis to find factors associated with the presence pDDIs. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 141/253 (55.7%) patients were exposed to at-least one pDDI. A total of 251 pDDIs were noted with a median of one pDDI/per patient (interquartile range:1-2) Majority interactions were of major severity (72.9%), pharmacodynamic (49.8%) and had fair documentation level (64.1%). Anti-cancer drugs were involved in 73.0% pDDIs with doxorubicin as the most commonly involved (40.0%) anti-cancer followed by cyclophosphamide (27.6%) and cisplatin (13.5%). Potential cardiac adverse events made the bulk (33.8%) of predicted events. Receiving >2 anti-cancer (OR = 5.19, p-value = 0.001) and >6 ancillary drugs (OR = 4.16, p-value = 0.033) emerged as the risk factors of pDDIs. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of pDDIs was within the range reported in published literature.

868,35076506,"The Health Professional's View on the Inclusion of Age in the Recommendations for Pneumococcal Vaccination: Results of a Cross-Sectional Survey in France.  Elderly people are at high risk for pneumococcal infections. However, older age is not an eligibility factor for pneumococcal vaccination in France. Adults with certain co-morbidities or immunocompromised states are eligible for vaccination, which leaves adults aged ≥65 years without comorbidities at-risk for pneumococcal infections. The objective of the study was to evaluate the acceptability to healthcare professionals (HCPs) of extending pneumococcal vaccination to all individuals ≥65 years. Based on themes identified in semi-structured interviews with 24 HCPs, a representative sample of 500 general practitioners and pharmacists were surveyed about their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs with respect to pneumococcal vaccination for individuals ≥65 years. Current recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination are poorly understood by participants (mean score: 5.8/10). Respondents were generally supportive of inclusion of age in vaccination recommendations (7.5/10), with 58% being very supportive. For 72% of HCPs, this would contribute to improved vaccination coverage. The strategy could be facilitated by associating pneumococcal vaccination with the influenza vaccination campaign (8.3/10). Pharmacists were favourable to participating in pneumococcal vaccination (8.5/10). In conclusion, extension of pneumococcal vaccination to all people aged ≥65 years would be welcomed by HCPs, simplifying identification of patients to be vaccinated and potentially improving vaccination coverage.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

(1) Background: This proof-of-concept study assessed an interactive web-based tool simulating three challenging non-academic learning situations-student professionalism, cross-cultural interactions, and student well-being-as a means of preceptor development. (2) Methods: Three scripts focused on professionalism, cross-cultural interactions, and student well-being were developed and implemented using a commercial narrative tool with branching dialog. Delivered online, this tool presented each challenge to participants. Participants had up to four response options at each turn of the conversation; the choice of response influenced the subsequent conversation, including coaching provided at the resolution of the situation. Participants were invited to complete pre-activity, immediate post-activity, and one-month follow-up questionnaires to assess satisfaction, self-efficacy, engagement, and knowledge change with the tool. Knowledge was assessed through situational judgment tests (SJTs). (3) Results: Thirty-two pharmacist preceptors participated. The frequency of participants reflecting on challenging learning situations increased significantly one-month post-simulation. Participants affirmatively responded that the tool was time-efficient, represented similar challenges they encountered in precepting, was easily navigable, and resulted in learning. Self-efficacy with skills in managing challenging learning situations increased significantly immediately post-simulation and at a one-month follow-up. Knowledge as measured through SJTs was not significantly changed. (4) Conclusions: Preceptors found an interactive narrative simulation a relevant, time-efficient approach for preceptor development for challenging non-academic learning situations.

There is little evidence that the PI rate is higher with MOs from hospitals (MOHs) than ambulatory (MOAs) settings, and their impact on the patient and community pharmacy is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to compare the MOH and MOA PI rates. The secondary objective was to describe PIs and their clinical and organizational impacts on patient and community pharmacy workflow. A total of 120 CPs participated in a prospective study. Each CP included 10 MOH and 10 MOA between January and June 2020. DRP and PI description and clinical and organizational impacts between MOH and MOA were assessed and compared. We analyzed 2325 MOs. PIs were significantly more frequent in MOH than in MOA (9.7% versus 4.7%; p < 0.001). The most reported PI was the difficulty of contacting hospital prescribers (n = 45; 52.2%). MOHs were associated with a longer dispensing process time and a greater impact on patient pathway and community pharmacy workflow than MOAs.

BACKGROUND Computer-based education has been widely implemented in healthcare professional development education. However, there has been little examination of the potential for computer-based education to enhance pharmacists' knowledge. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of computer-based education on improving pharmacists' knowledge compared to printed education material. METHODS This study was a web-based randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group where they had access to the computer-based education module on Pharmacy5in5.ca or to a control group where they had access to printed educational material. Knowledge gain was assessed using a pre- and post-knowledge test. RESULTS A total of 120 pharmacists were recruited and 101 completed the post-knowledge test (50/60 in the intervention group; 51/60 in the control group). Both groups showed a significant increase in knowledge gain (intervention group: pre-test mean score 19.35 ± 3.56, post-test mean score 22.42 ± 3.812, p value < 0.001; control group pre-test mean score 19.22 ± 3.45, post-test mean score 23.29 ± 3.087, p value < 0.001).

875,35076609,"Game-Based Learning in Pharmacy Education.  Game-based learning (GBL) involves adding game elements to non-game activities to encourage engagement. Pharmacy curricula are required to incorporate active learning to meet accreditation standards. The literature supports that well-designed GBL holds the attention of students and improves knowledge in some instances. Furthermore, these adaptable experiences can be leveraged for a variety of content areas in pharmacy education. Some activities utilized by educators require large amounts of technological expertise, while others involve minimal use of technology. The incorporation of technology can create highly immersive experiences for learners; however, there are barriers (e.g., financial and technology prowess) to implementation compared to simpler designs. One area of GBL that is not well defined in the literature is how to adequately assess student learning outcomes. Most current studies describe subjective attitudes and confidence or assess content knowledge through objective pre- and post-tests.

A 54-year-old female patient was referred by a physician to the pharmacist in a rural, integrated care team for a comprehensive medication review (CMR) to address the patient's concerns of possible Parkinson's disease (PD). While PD may occur over the progression of age, medications that affect dopamine transport can also cause DIP, a secondary form of Parkinson's disease. Although PD and DIP may be clinically indistinguishable, differentiation may be possible by reviewing a patient's medication history for any potential causative drugs correlating to the timeline of the onset of symptoms. In this case, the pharmacist reviewed the medication profile and identified medications that could be responsible for causing DIP, specifically bupropion. The pharmacist suggested discontinuing bupropion and identifying another option for treating depression. The patient appreciated the suggestion and education, but ultimately preferred continuing her bupropion therapy instead of discontinuing therapy or changing to an alternative agent. At a follow-up meeting with the pharmacist, not only was the patient still experiencing tremors despite taking carbidopa/levodopa, but additional medications known to be potential inducers of tremors were added to her regimen. Although the pharmacist repeatedly discussed DIP with the patient and believed stopping bupropion would determine whether her Parkinsonism was PD or DIP, ultimately the patient continued taking bupropion because of concerns related to depression severity and the impact on her well-being.

Statins are lipid-lowing medications shown to reduce cardiovascular events and are recommended for specific patient populations at elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite the demonstrated efficacy of statins for reducing ASCVD risk, and guidance on which populations should receive statin therapy, a substantial portion of eligible patients are not prescribed statin therapy. Pharmacists have attempted to increase the number of eligible patients receiving appropriate statin therapy through a variety of interventions and across several clinical settings. In this article, we highlight multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions to improve statin use. A total of seven studies were selected for this narrative review, demonstrating the effectiveness and barriers of different statin-initiation programs delivered by pharmacists to increase statin use in eligible patients. Among the interventions assessed, a combination of provider communicating and statin prescribing through collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) appear to the be the most useful at increasing statin use.

Background Despite several international studies demonstrating that ward-based pharmacists improve medication quality, ward pharmacists are not generally established in German hospitals. Aim We assessed the effect of a ward-based clinical pharmacist on the medication quality of geriatric inpatients in a German university hospital. Method The before-after study with a historic control group was conducted on the geriatric ward. During the control phase, patients received standard care without the involvement of a pharmacist. The intervention consisted of a clinical pharmacist providing pharmaceutical care from admission to discharge. Medication quality was measured on admission and discharge using the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI). A linear regression analysis was conducted to calculate the influence of the intervention on the MAI. Results Patients in the intervention group (n = 152, mean 83 years) were older and took more drugs at admission compared to the control group (n = 159, 81 years). For both groups, the MAI per patient improved significantly from admission to discharge. Although the intervention did not influence the summated MAI score per patient, the intervention significantly reduced the MAI criteria Dosage (p = 0.006), Correct Directions (p = 0.016) and Practical Directions (p = 0.004) as well as the proportion of overall inappropriate MAI ratings (at least 1 of 9 criteria inappropriate) (p = 0.015).

881,35077810,"Investigating clinicians' determinants of antimicrobial prescribing behaviour using the Theoretical Domains Framework. AIM To identify and quantify potential determinants of antimicrobial prescribing behaviour, using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). METHODS A cross-sectional survey involving (∼4,000) doctors and pharmacists (∼400) working within Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Qatar. An online questionnaire, developed with reference to the TDF, included: personal and practice demographics, and Likert statements on potential determinants of antimicrobial prescribing practice. Analysis included Principal Component Analysis (PCA), descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS In total, 535 responses were received, 339 (63.4%) from doctors. Respondents were predominantly male, 346 (64.7%). Just over half (n = 285, 53.3%) had ≤5 years' experience. PCA showed a three component (C) solution; 'Guidelines compliance' (C1), 'Influences on practice' (C2) and 'Self-efficacy' (C3). The scales derived for each component had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas >0.7), indicating statistical appropriateness for developing scales. Respondents generally scored highly for 'Guidelines compliance' and 'Self-efficacy'. The lowest levels of positive scores were in relation to the items within the 'Influences on practice' component, with particular focus on TDF domains; environmental context and resources, and social influences. Inferential analysis comparing component scores across demographic characteristics showed; doctors, the more qualified and those with greater experience were more likely to be positive in responses. CONCLUSIONS This study has identified that environmental context and resources, and social influences, with an emphasis on pharmacists and early career clinicians, may be useful targets for BCIs to improve clinicians' antimicrobial prescribing and; thereby, reducing AMR rates.

Local governments and medical institutions have struggled to respond. The purpose of this questionnaire survey was to evaluate strategies for pharmacy services, availability of ethanol for disinfection, and measures adopted for in-house infection control aiming to enhance future infection control efforts. METHODS Since pharmacies have been also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed COVID-19 measures taken at 174 pharmacies in Ehime prefecture, Japan. RESULTS The survey showed that pharmacies made changes to facilities and equipment, such as installing partitions at dispensing counters, procuring personal protective equipment for employees, and using ethanol for disinfection, even when these items were in short supply. Pharmacies also adopted new strategies, such as holding meetings with suppliers and internal staff via online platforms. Many pharmacies also undertook COVID-19 preventive measures, such as preparing documentation of infection control measures and disinfectants. Moreover, they held lectures and workshops on disinfection and infection control measures.

In the UK, medicines for chronic conditions in children and young people (CYP) are typically initiated within secondary or tertiary care, with responsibility for ongoing supply often then passed to the child's general practitioner (GP) and community pharmacist. The patient should then be reviewed in regular specialist clinics, with two-way communication for any changes in medications or clinical status undertaken between primary and secondary/tertiary care. This arrangement allows long-term medications to be obtained close to home.Although this is what parents expect, the reality is often messy, with families regularly needing to source some medicines from the GPs and others via hospitals or homecare services. In addition, these arrangements are not uniform, they vary across different areas of the UK and depend on individual GP or hospital prescriber acceptance. When neither primary, secondary or tertiary care accepts it is their responsibility to prescribe, or patients are under multiple specialists, families often feel left to navigate this complex and variable supply system themselves. Obtaining a prescription is only the start of the process for families as dispensing from a community pharmacy can also be challenging.In this article, we set out the barriers and potential solutions to this complex issue.

An SDPD program was developed to ensure all preceptors received documented preceptor development. A menu of discussion topics and associated teaching sheets were created by the school's Office of Experiential Education (OEE). On each rotation, Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) students led discussions with their preceptors on a topic chosen by the preceptor and submitted documentation of the education. Preceptors answered a survey related to the amount of information and time required of the SDPD program, their preference for different formats of preceptor development, one important thing learned through the SDPD program, and future development topics of interest. Students were interviewed regarding their perceptions and use of the SDPD program.Results. A novel SDPD program resulted in documentation of preceptor development for all APPE rotations. Seventy-nine preceptors (31% response rate) participated in the survey. Preceptors agreed they were able to customize their preceptor development (M=3.7, SD=0.84), incorporate what they learned into practice (M=3.7, SD=0.74), it was a convenient format (M=4.0, SD=0.66), and the SDPD was valuable to prepare students to be future preceptors (M=4.2, SD=0.64). Students reported the SDPD improved their confidence in communicating with a supervisor and prepared them for precepting.Conclusion. An SDPD program improved documented preceptor development. The program allowed preceptors to customize development opportunities in a convenient format. It was perceived positively by preceptors who would recommend the SPDP model to other schools of pharmacy for preceptor development.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
885,35078837,"Exploration of prescribing error reporting across primary care: a qualitative study. OBJECTIVES To explore barriers and facilitators to prescribing error reporting across primary care. DESIGN Qualitative semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews were conducted to explore facilitators and barriers to reporting prescribing errors. Data collection and thematic analysis were informed by the COM-B model of behaviour change. Framework analysis was used for coding and charting the data with the assistance of NVivo software (V.12). General and context specific influences on prescribing error reporting were mapped to constructs from the COM-B model (ie, capability, opportunity and motivation). SETTING Primary care organisations, including community pharmacy, general practice and community care from North East England. PARTICIPANTS We interviewed a maximal variation purposive sample of 25 participants, including prescribers, community pharmacists and key stakeholders with primary care or medicines safety roles at local, regional and national levels. RESULTS Our findings describe a range of factors that influence the capability, opportunity and motivation to report prescribing errors in primary care. Three key contextual factors are also highlighted that were found to underpin many of the behavioural influences on reporting in this setting: the nature of prescribing; heterogeneous priorities for error reporting across and within different primary care organisations; and the complex infrastructure of reporting and learning pathways across primary care. Findings suggest that there is a lack of consistency in how, when and by whom, prescribing errors are reported across primary care. CONCLUSIONS Further research is needed to identify cross-organisational and interprofessional consensus on agreed reporting thresholds and how best to facilitate a more collaborative approach to reporting and learning, that is, sensitive to the needs and priorities of disparate organisations across primary care. Despite acknowledged challenges, there may be potential for an increased role of community pharmacy in prescribing error reporting to support future learning.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

887,35080761,"How to Choose the Right Inhaler Using a Patient-Centric Approach?  There are many different inhaler devices and medications on the market for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with over 230 drug-delivery system combinations available. However, despite the abundance of effective treatment options, the achieved disease control in clinical practice often remains unsatisfactory. In this context, a key determining factor is the match or mismatch of an inhalation device with the characteristics or needs of an individual patient. Indeed, to date, no ideal device exists that fits all patients, and a personalized approach needs to be considered. Several useful choice-guiding algorithms have been developed in the recent years to improve inhaler-patient matching, but a comprehensive tool that translates the multifactorial complexity of inhalation therapy into a user-friendly algorithm is still lacking. To address this, a multidisciplinary expert panel has developed an evidence-based practical treatment tool that allows a straightforward way of choosing the right inhaler for each patient.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Sterile compounding education is an essential curricular component across pharmacy schools. A virtual sterile intravenous compounding experience was implemented in place of traditional in-person delivery within the patient care lab course at one college of pharmacy. The objective of this manuscript is to describe student perceptions regarding student preparedness, satisfaction, and preferences after the virtual intravenous sterile compounding experience. Students reviewed a pre-recorded lecture and readings which covered sterile compounding fundamentals. Prior to the class session, students were provided with a kit that included simulated intravenous products. Each class session included approximately 33 students and three instructors via online video conferencing. The class session began with a large-group discussion to clarify questions following review of the videos and readings. Then, the class was divided into three breakout rooms with up to 11 students and one instructor. The instructor led the small group through stepwise sterile compounding procedures and provided feedback to the students. Students then completed an online multiple-choice quiz. A survey assessing student perceptions including preparedness, satisfaction, and preferences regarding the virtual experience was disseminated to students. A Mann-Whitney U analysis was performed to compare the ordinal data. A P-value of 0.05 was used to determine significance. Seventy-two (75%) second-year students and 32 (33.3%) third-year students completed the survey yielding an overall response rate of 54%.

892,35081939,"Community pharmacist counseling improves adherence and asthma control: a nationwide study. BACKGROUND Pharmaceutical counseling (PC) interventions have been shown to improve adherence to controller medication and asthma control. However, the real-life impact of these PC interventions in difficult-to-control asthma patients remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of PC interventions in real life using nationwide claims data. METHODS Demographics and drugs use of patients who received ICS in 2017 with or without pharmaceutical counseling were retrieved from a Belgian claims database. Asthma-related drug use from 1 year before first ICS dispensing in 2017 (reference period) was compared with 1 year after. Outcomes were usage of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in defined daily doses (DDD), proportion of users of short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), antibiotics, oral corticosteroids (OCS), asthma biologicals and controller-to-total (CTT) ratio. RESULTS The study population consisted of difficult-to-control asthma patients aged 5-40 years with at least the first interview within 90 days after first ICS dispensing (n = 1350). ICS usage increased significantly in the year after PC intervention compared with the reference period (+ 43.3 DDD/patient, p < 0.05). A nominal decrease was observed in the proportion of SABA (48.0 to 46.2%) and antibiotics (54.5 to 52.7%) after PC intervention compared with the reference period. CTT ratio significantly increased from 0.671 to 0.749 (p < 0.05). The proportion of biological users was nominally lower in the intervention group compared with a control group (n = 50,477) in the post-intervention time period (0.22% versus 0.30%).

Objective To illustrate the impact of a pharmacist-led hypertension medication management program on skilled nursing facility residents. Design Sixteen-week retrospective, observational study. Setting Long-term care, local skilled nursing facility. Patients, Participants Subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension and treated with at least one antihypertensive medication were identified using electronic health records. The subjects also needed to be enrolled in the Hypertension Medication Management Program, and were excluded if receiving hospice or psychiatric treatment or had active infection with COVID-19. Initially, 120 residents were eligible with 54 in an intervention and 66 in a control group. At 16-weeks, a total of 67 residents remained after some were lost to follow-up. Interventions Under a collaborative practice agreement, a pharmacist optimized medications, ordered monitoring of vital signs, and relevant labs in conjunction with standard physician care (intervention): these subjects were compared to those who received standard physician care alone (control). Results There was a significant difference in the proportion of subjects who attained treatment goals for diastolic BP, but not for systolic BP or mean arterial pressure. The proportion of subjects in the intervention group who had falls, hospitalization or death was not significantly different between groups. diastolic pressure (90.9% and 38.0%; P < 0.0001; 86.7% and 32.4%; P < 0.0001) but not for systolic and mean arterial pressure at 8 and 16 weeks.

897,35082103,"Mapping the resilience performance of community pharmacy to maintain patient safety during the Covid-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND The first UK wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 placed unprecedented stress on community pharmacy. Various policies and initiatives were announced during this period to support community pharmacy to continue to perform in a manner that prioritised patient safety. However, little is understood about how these policies and initiatives were implemented by staff working in community pharmacy, and the system adaptions and responses that were initiated to maintain patient safety. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to investigate how staff working in UK community pharmacy during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 responded and adapted to system stressors to maintain patient safety. METHODS We adopted a qualitative interview approach, underpinned by Resilient Healthcare theory, with interview data collected between July 2020 and January 2021. Data were synthesised and analysed using Framework Analysis. RESULTS 23 community pharmacy staff from England and Scotland were interviewed. We identified five themes supported by between two and six sub-themes: 1. Covid-19, an impending threat to system; 2. Patient safety stressors during the first waves of Covid-19; 3. Altering the system, responding to system stressors; 4. Monitoring and adjusting and 5. Learning for the future. CONCLUSION Privileging the accounts of community pharmacy staff working on the frontline during the pandemic illuminated how responses and adaptions were developed and deployed, how continual monitoring occurred, and the factors that supported or hindered system resilience. The key learning derived from this study can serve to shorten the gap between 'work as imagined' and 'work as done', and in doing so, support the future resilience performance of community pharmacy during future outbreaks of Covid-19 or similar events.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
898,35082193,"[Evaluation of the Pharmaceutical Properties of Clobetasol Propionate Ointments and Base Stability of the Mixture with Heparinoid Oil Based Creams].  Clobetasol propionate ointment (CLPO) formulations have been classified as members of the ""strongest"" steroidal efficacy group, with eight of these formulations currently marketed in Japan. Evaluations of pharmaceutical properties of each formulation revealed three classification types: droplet dispersion type containing propylene glycol (PG) and surfactant, type with surfactant but not PG, and other types. These rheological properties were diverse, with no correlation found between viscosity and ointment type. However, when CLPO and six types of heparinoid oil-based cream (HPOC) formulation mixtures were stored at 37°C, a liquid layer was observed starting at 24 hours for one CLPO formulation in which polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 was used as a surfactant out of the four droplet-dispersion type ointments and two low-viscosity HPOC formulations. In contrast, one other type of CLPO formulation that contained a surfactant with polysorbate 80, but not PG, exhibited a liquid layer for all of HPOC formulations. This suggests that CLPO formulations that contain a surfactant with a high hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value are likely to generate a liquid layer for mixtures containing HPOC formulation. The present results demonstrate that not only the pharmaceutical properties of the eight CLPO formulations differ from one another, but also that the stabilities of HPOC formulation mixtures are significantly different. Therefore, pharmacists need to focus on inactive as well as active pharmaceutical ingredients to select formulations that patients will want to use, in addition to successfully treating their pathological conditions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction There is a predicted growth of up to 17% in an older adult of Malaysian above 60 years of age by 2040. This will increase the workload of almost every healthcare provider to ensure optimal geriatric care. Purpose This study aimed to assess pharmacy students' knowledge and attitudes towards geriatric pharmacy education and older patients to determine their preparation in delivering appropriate medical care to the geriatric population. Methods Self-administered questionnaires were distributed among pharmacy students in different Malaysian universities. The survey included several sections to assess multiple aspects such as sociodemographic information, assessment of knowledge using a validated 28-item Geriatric Knowledge Assessment Scale (GKAS), and attitudes towards geriatrics education. Results The response rate was around 70% of the respondents. The mean (± standard deviation) age of the cohort was 22.28 (±1.12) years. Despite around 78% of pharmacy students claiming that their knowledge of geriatric care is adequate, their GKAS score showed that only around 20% have high geriatric knowledge. Around 80% of them showed a positive attitude on the importance of taking courses focused on geriatric care and demonstrated interest to further knowledge and training in geriatric care. However, more than half of the students were uncertain of their answers towards their attitudes regarding older patients. Conclusion Given the growing role of pharmacists in the ageing population, this study highlights the importance of geriatric care education among potential pharmacists. Therefore, we urge the need to improve/develop geriatrics education and training into the pharmacy curriculum to ensure sufficient preparation for actual practice after graduation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction Community pharmacy professionals are among the initial healthcare providers and could play crucial roles in preventing and managing cardiovascular disorders. This study aimed to assess perceptions and involvements of community pharmacy professionals in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disorders in Gondar city and nearby rural towns, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A multi-centered cross-sectional survey was conducted on community pharmacy professionals in Gondar city and the nearby rural towns from June to July 2021. Independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to show mean score differences of pharmacists towards the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases. A 95% confidence interval with a P-value of < 0.05 in the tests was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 223 initial samples, 210 completed the survey and resulted in a 94.2% response rate. The average perception and involvement scores of the community pharmacy professionals towards the prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular syndromes were 4.1 and 3.8, respectively. Numerous professionals (>86%) agreed on weight reductions, alcohol consumption restrictions and physical exercises to decrease cardiovascular risks. Pharmacy professionals recruited from Gondar city had significantly higher mean scores compared with pharmacy professionals involved from rural towns (P < 0.001). A significant difference in mean involvement score was also noted in regarding the numbers of clients serving/day (P = 0.026). Conclusion Community pharmacy professionals had good perceptions on prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND Antimicrobial stewardship is a systematic effort to change prescribing attitudes that can provide benefit in the provision of care to persons with cystic fibrosis (CF). Our objective was to decrease the unwarranted use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and assess the impact of an empiric antibiotic algorithm using quality improvement methodology. METHODS We assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in CF. We assessed baseline antibiotic use for treatment of PEx and developed an algorithm to guide empiric antibiotic therapy. We included persons with CF admitted to Children's National Hospital for treatment of PEx between January 2017 and March 2020. Our primary outcome measure was reducing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use, measured by use consistent with the empiric antibiotic algorithm. The primary intervention was the initiation of the algorithm. Secondary outcomes included documentation of justification for broad-spectrum antibiotic use and use of ID consult. RESULTS Data were collected from 56 persons with CF who had a total of 226 PEx events. The mean age at first PEx was 12 (SD 6.7) years; 55% were female, 80% were white, and 29% were Hispanic. After initiation of the algorithm, the proportion of PEx with antibiotic use consistent with the algorithm increased from 46.2% to 79.5%. Documentation of justification for broad-spectrum antibiotics increased from 56% to 85%. Use of ID consults increased from 17% to 54%.

PURPOSE To assess the impact on readmission rates for CMS core measures (CCM) patients and patients receiving care under the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) Advanced Model resulting from implementing a pharmacist-led transitions of care (TOC) clinic in central Florida. METHODS This study cohorts consisted of patients in 2 strata (CCM and BPCI), and pre-post comparisons were conducted within each stratum. CCM and BCPI patient stratification was based on diagnoses. Patients referred to the TOC clinic were identified and compared to patients who did not receive TOC clinic services in the prior year. The pharmacist-led TOC clinic services consisted of a postdischarge telephone interview by a pharmacist to identify TOC barriers. Pharmacists in the TOC clinic conducted medication reconciliations, provided education, and completed follow-up telephone visits to mitigate these barriers. The primary outcome was the 30-day readmission rate for CCM patients and 90-day readmission rate for BPCI patients. The secondary outcomes were the numbers and types of interventions performed in the pharmacist-led TOC clinic. RESULTS A total of 1,203 patients met the inclusion criteria for the CCM stratum. The CCM post-group had an overall reduction in the rate of 30-day readmission relative to the pre-group (6.25% vs 13.29%, P < 0.0327).

PURPOSE To describe the role of the pharmacist in and initial outcomes of a remote monitoring and telemanagement program implemented to proactively provide outreach to high-risk patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. SUMMARY A remote monitoring and telemanagement program was developed at a large, nonprofit, multicenter, academic health system as an innovative way to manage patients at risk for decompensation of their chronic diseases in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program mobilized an interprofessional workforce including nurses, medical assistants, social workers, virtualists, patient schedulers, and ambulatory care pharmacists. Patient outreach included a combination of telephone calls and digital outreach. The goal was to monitor patients' health status remotely and assess for early signs of decompensation. Pharmacists conducted telephone outreach to answer patients' medication questions and address signs and symptoms of worsening chronic conditions. Pharmacists were able to utilize an existing collaborative practice agreement (CPA) to adjust medication therapy and order laboratory tests as needed for safety and efficacy monitoring. Since the program's inception in April 2020 through January 2021, pharmacists have addressed over 1,600 medication questions or instances of worsening clinical signs and symptoms. CONCLUSION A comprehensive remote monitoring and telemanagement program utilized a multidisciplinary team to monitor high-risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

PURPOSE Veterans prescribed oral antineoplastic therapies (OATs) by community providers outside the Veterans Health Administration (VA) may lack access to comprehensive medication management. To address this, our multidisciplinary team developed and implemented a pharmacist-led telehealth medication management program for veterans prescribed OATs by community providers. SUMMARY The program exclusively uses telehealth to connect veterans with a dedicated board-certified clinical oncology pharmacist who provides comprehensive medication management. The program is based on established pharmacy models found in the research literature. We developed a standard operating procedure, communication templates, patient education materials, and a suite of health information technology tools to help streamline pharmacy processes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to design implementation strategies to promote the adoption of the program. In the first year, 64 veterans from 3 VA medical centers were enrolled in the program. The oncology clinical pharmacist performed 342 encounters and 101 interventions. The program saved an estimated $200,724 in medication-related costs. The veterans we surveyed reported high levels of satisfaction with the pharmacy services provided by the program. CONCLUSION The delivery of comprehensive medication management through telehealth is feasible from a healthcare system perspective and beneficial for patients. The board-certified oncology clinical pharmacist provided remote pharmacy services to Veterans across three sites in a large and rural service area for the VA.

907,35084464,"Telepharmacy services in acute care: Diverse needs within a large health system. PURPOSE In this paper, we describe CommonSpirit Health's telepharmacy service, which serves 64 hospitals in 10 states. Hospitals range in size from critical access to quaternary care centers. SUMMARY Telepharmacy services in acute care may be divided into 2 primary styles: hospitals requiring after-hours support utilizing telepharmacists to bridge shifts otherwise uncovered by pharmacists and hospitals with round-the-clock onsite pharmacy services utilizing telepharmacists to enhance efficiency in processing medication orders. When providing after-hours service, telepharmacists review all medication orders. The primary goal is to provide pharmacist care at all hours. In hospitals with round-the-clock onsite pharmacy services, telepharmacists focus on efficiency of medication order review. Median turnaround times in these hospitals decreased 50% to 70% after implementing a telepharmacy service. Barriers to implementation include managing different electronic health records, variability in hospital practices, and communicating with onsite clinicians. Regular interaction with onsite leaders is a key component in overcoming these barriers. This enables the telepharmacy team to respond to hospital-specific changes and maintain competence. The service adjusts to provide additional support based on the needs of the sites. Most telepharmacists work from home. While this can present challenges, we consider it an advantage in recruitment and retention. CONCLUSION CommonSpirit Health utilizes its telepharmacy service for hospitals large and small to enhance efficiency in processing medication orders and to provide round-the-clock pharmacist care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
908,35084487,"Implementation of a pharmacy-led virtual academic detailing program at the US Veterans Health Administration. PURPOSE To provide a summary of the implementation of a virtual academic detailing pilot program at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). SUMMARY In September 2018, VA Pharmacy Benefits Management implemented a virtual academic detailing (""e-Detailing"") pilot program across three regional networks. Academic detailing involves multifaceted collaborative outreach delivered by trained healthcare clinicians to other clinicians using targeted educational interventions that improve clinical decision-making. Across VA, academic detailing programs are primarily staffed by specially trained clinical pharmacist specialists. Implementation began with an in-person meeting to train academic detailers on using the virtual academic detailing platform (VA Video Connect) and virtual soft skills, which was followed by regular facilitation meetings to address issues and share experiences. During e-Detailing program implementation, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, prompting the US Department of Health and Human Services to declare a public health emergency. VA followed with restrictions on nonessential travel for all employees, thus hampering in-person academic detailing activities. Fortunately, e-Detailing provided an alternative channel for academic detailers across VA to continue delivering critical outreach to providers during the pandemic. Qualitative assessment of academic detailers' and providers' perceptions on e-Detailing highlighted the need for local leadership support for e-Detailing and telehealth, the efficiency of virtual compared to in-person visits, and potential time savings resulting from avoidance of long commutes. CONCLUSION The timing of e-Detailing implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the need and potential for a virtual platform to deliver timely provider outreach.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
909,35084792,"Management of epilepsy in Lebanon: medication reviews and drug-related problems. PURPOSE The goal of epilepsy treatment is to control seizures without drug related problems (DRPs). The evaluation of anti-seizure drugs (ASD) strategies and identification of DRPs are rarely studied. This study aimed primarily to evaluate the choice of ASD according to international guidelines and secondarily to identify and describe anti-seizure drug-related problems. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted during one year among Lebanese adults with epilepsy attending neurology clinics. The choice of ASD was compared to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. Drug-drug interactions were evaluated by the Lexicomp database, and the DRP classification was performed using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe classification. RESULTS Four hundred and four patients with epilepsy were included. The prescription for an ASD was in accordance with the indication set in guidelines in 75.0% of population, and 1078 DRPs were identified. The main DRPs detected were adverse drug reactions (51.0%), inappropriate combinations of drugs (50.0%), and suboptimal drug regimens (46.3%). Single and divorced patients, who living in Mount Lebanon, and who took the old with the new generation had a less risk to have an inadequate prescription to guidelines. However, female gender, controlled epilepsy, multiple ASDs, and living in a rural region increased DRPs. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that quarter of the population used ASDs contraindicated according to international guidelines. Since DRPs were related to the number and type of ASD prescribed, it is important to assess the case of each patient by a clinical pharmacist to prevent drug-drug interactions and iatrogenic issues.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
910,35086772,"Defining the role of pharmacists in addressing the social determinants of health.  As one of the overreaching goals of Healthy People 2030, addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) to reduce health disparities is a nationwide concern, with objectives informed by interdisciplinary teams of experts. However, there remains much discussion regarding the roles of healthcare providers in addressing SDOH. While current guidance suggests that all members of the healthcare team must be empowered to address SDOH, current guidance explicitly references physicians, nurses, social workers and staff, and do not specifically include pharmacists. While pharmacists are taught about the impact of SDOH in pharmacy curricula, actionable strategies for pharmacists to address SDOH in practice have not been clearly outlined. Pharmacists have multifaceted interactions with patients and may be influential in meeting individual patient needs, identifying social risk factors, and addressing upstream causes of health disparities. This paper proposes a framework for the role of pharmacists in addressing the SDOH through strategies at the patient, practice, and community levels. The concepts presented in this paper are meant to serve as a launch point for discussion and to promote the inclusion of pharmacists in the conversations around sustainable efforts to achieve health equity. This framework is not intended to limit the scope of pharmacists in addressing SDOH - on the contrary, it is our hope that this outline may be used to expand the education of future healthcare professionals regarding their role in addressing the social determinants of health.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
911,35086802,"Medication reconciliation-is it possible to speed up without compromising quality? A before-after study in the emergency department. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate whether it was possible to decrease the time used for medication reconciliation (MR) in the emergency department without compromising quality. A more efficient method will enable more patients to receive MR as early as possible after admission to hospital. METHODS Potential key factors for improvement of the standard method of MR by clinical pharmacists were identified through an observational period. A revised method was developed, focusing on decreasing time spent on the patient interview by use of a condensed checklist and probing questions based on information from a prescription database. Non-inferior quality (proportion of patients with at least one identified medication discrepancy and number of identified medication discrepancies per patient) of the revised method was evaluated using a before-after study design with 200 individuals in each group. Non-inferiority limit was set at 10%. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation of the difference in time use per patient in the MR process between the before and after group. RESULTS Mean age of the included patients was 78 years in both groups. The time used for MR in the after group was 34% shorter (37 min vs 56 min, p<0.0001) compared with the before group. The revised method was shown to be non-inferior compared with the original method with respect to the proportion of patients with at least one identified discrepancy (81%, 95% CI 76% to 86% vs 79%, 95% CI 73% to 84%). Also, non-inferiority was shown for the number of identified discrepancies per patient, where the average number of discrepancies per patient was 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) in both groups. CONCLUSION This study showed that it was possible to speed up the MR process without compromising its effectiveness in identifying medication discrepancies.",1,1,0,0,0,Unclear if identified discrepancies were clinically significant.,,,,,,,,,
912,35086803,"Primary care electronic medication record discrepancies in patients starting treatment at a hospital-based ambulatory care pharmacy and impact on prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of discrepancies between primary care electronic medication records (EMR) and patient reported medication (PRM) in ambulatory patients starting a hospital dispensing treatment (HDT) at a hospital-based ambulatory care pharmacy (HACPh). Our secondary aims were to analyse factors associated with the presence of discrepancies and their impact on the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with the HDT. METHODS Retrospective study including 230 patients starting a HDT at the HACPh. Pharmacists interviewed patients and PRM was compared with EMR. Discrepancies were classified as omissions (medication in the PRM not present in the EMR) and commissions (medication active in the EMR that the patients were not taking). Potential DDIs with the HDT were screened, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect factors associated with the presence of discrepancies. RESULTS We identified 221 discrepancies in 116 (50.4%) patients. Being visited by three or more medical specialties (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.37) and attending private healthcare (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 16.72) in the 12 months before the study inclusion were the factors independently associated with the presence of discrepancies. Among patients with commissions (n=91), 15.4% had a potential DDI between the HDT and one medication from the EMR that they were not taking at that moment. Among patients with omissions (n=45), 11.1% had a potential DDI between the HDT and a medication in the PRM not present in the EMR. CONCLUSIONS About 40% of patients had one or more medications in the EMR which they were not taking and one fifth used medications that were not listed in the EMR. EMR should not be used as the only source of information when screening for DDIs, especially in patients followed by different medical specialties or combining private and public healthcare.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
913,35086859,"Improving the supply of critical medicines from pharmacy to reduce the delay in medicines administration on wards.  It is nationally and locally recognised that doses of critical medications are missed or omitted on a daily basis. This has been highlighted by a National Patient Safety Agency alert published in 2010. Since then Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trusthas introduced initiatives to tackle this problem, but there are clear indications that further work is still required. The aim of this service improvement project was to improve the availability of critical medications on the ward to ensure they are available thirty minutes prior to the next scheduled dose.Two plan-do-study-act cycles were undertaken over a 14-day period (January/February 2020) to reduce the time taken for critical medications to be supplied to the ward after a request was placed on the eOrdering system, on one care of the elderly ward. Medication request and prescription tracking data were captured during working hours each week (Monday to Sunday) and examined. The time taken for a request to be processed was captured.Following the introduction of a critical medicines checklist in the pharmacy dispensary and later a flow chart on the ward, availability of critical medication on the ward rose from 89% to 93%. However, the project did not meet the project aim of ensuring 95% of critical medications requested were available on the ward.The project highlighted that for sustainable and robust improvement, the electronic prescribing system required improvement rather than change in the work processes of the ward and pharmacy professionals.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
914,35087286,"Knowledge, Practices, and Perceived Barriers in Cancer Pain Management at Oncology Units: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Medical Staff in China. Background Despite the great signs of progress in cancer pain management in China, the associated pain remains under-treated. Poor knowledge among the medical staff is an important factor contributing to the under-treatment of cancer pain. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, practices, and perceived barriers in cancer pain management among the medical staff at oncology units in China. Patients and Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with the medical staff (including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists) at oncology units in tertiary hospitals of China between December 2020 and January 2021. The questionnaire assessed the knowledge, practices, and perceived barriers in cancer pain management. Results A total of 1262 medical staff responded to the questionnaire; the response rate was 94.2%. Most participants had good knowledge of the three-step analgesic ladder of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for Adult Cancer Pain. Knowledge deficit was prominent in questions on opioid dose titration and rotation and adverse effects of opioids; the correct response rate was less than 40%. Training, work experience in oncology, and education level were significantly related to knowledge of cancer pain management (all P < 0.001). In clinical practice for cancer pain management, approximately 57.2% of medical staff were unfamiliar with opioid dose titration and rotation; only 14.4% treated cancer pain through multidisciplinary collaboration. Poor medication compliance, difficult individualized analgesia protocols, and insufficient multidisciplinary participation were the most frequently perceived barriers by the medical staff for pain management. Conclusion These findings suggested a further need for integrating recent guidelines to strengthen continued training (especially among juniors and those with low education levels) and patient education to improve the knowledge and clinical practices of cancer pain management among the medical staff in China.

915,35087374,"Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Among Patients With Epilepsy and Diabetes Mellitus, Focusing on the Outcome of Treatment.  Introduction: Millions all over the world live with epilepsy, and they may require long-term drug treatment. The use and interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) have grown over the previous years. Coadministration of herbal products with medicines may result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and/or unfavorable interactions. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of CAM use among patients with epilepsy, to compare the results to those of the patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), to reveal factors that may drive the use of CAM, and to measure outcomes and adherence. It was also our intent to have state-of-the-art information on CAM use in our region among patients with the two diseases above. Materials and Methods: We conducted a non-interventional study using a self-developed questionnaire. It was distributed among adult patients with either epilepsy or DM who also suffered from cardiovascular consequences. A database was compiled from the anonymous questionnaires filled in voluntarily by the patients. Basic statistics were used to analyze this database. Results: A total of 227 questionnaires were filled in by 127 patients (55.9%) with epilepsy and 100 patients (44.1%) with DM. Mean age was 54.54 ± 17.33 years. Of the patients, 50.2% were male. Average body weight was 80.3 ± 17.3 kg. Of the patients, 22 (9.7%) used CAM because they believed in CAM. Two of them reported ADRs. Among the patients with epilepsy, the ratio was only 7.9% compared to 12% among those with DM. While the number of CAM users was higher among younger patients with epilepsy, it was the elderly patients with DM who tended to use CAM. Conclusion: Attention should be paid to reliance on CAM during the follow-up. Our finding that health-conscious patients tend to use CAM more often (than the general population) may indicate it is necessary to discuss CAM usage sincerely. CAMs modulating cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes were the most common, leading to interactions with medication used and resulting in ADRs.

Background Pharmaceutical drug therapy problems (DTPs) are a major public health problem. We examined patient-level risk factors for DTPs among Cambodian Americans. Methods Community health workers (CHWs) verbally administered surveys and completed a detailed medication review form with participants. A doctoral-level pharmacist reviewed the form with the patient and CHW to determine DTP number and type (appropriateness, effectiveness, safety, and adherence). Results Participants (n = 63) averaged 55 years old, 6 years of education, 52% were married, 87% spoke Khmer at home, with modal household income <$20,000 (41%). The percentage of participants with DTPs was: 45% appropriateness, 25% effectiveness, 64% safety, and 30% adherence, averaging 3.7 DTPs per patient. In multiple regressions, patient characteristics uniquely predicted each type of DTP. In a multiple regression controlling for number of medications, being married reduced total DTPs (IRR = 0.70) and being depressed increased total DTPs (IRR = 1.26).

Purpose: Currently, managing the public and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is constituting a health care challenge worldwide. Patient-oriented management is of crucial importance to promote emergency preparedness and response. This study aims to formulate an integrated pharmacist management strategy of the public and patients and to provide evidence-based and practical references. Methods: Evidence-based review and practical analysis were utilized. First, PubMed, EMBASE and Chinese database were searched. Studies about patient management in major public health emergencies were included. Second, the Chinese experience of patient management was analyzed and identified. Finally, combining evidence-based and practical analysis, the pharmacist management strategy of the public and patients was researched and summarized. Results: Regarding the home quarantine period, pharmacist management services should include medication guidance, guidance on risk monitoring, sanitation measures education, health management guidance and psychological support. Regarding the outpatient visit period, pharmacists should participate in the control of in-hospital infections and provide physician-pharmacist joint clinic services, pharmacy clinic services, medication therapy management, medication consultation services, drug supply guarantee and drug dispensing services. Regarding the hospitalization period, pharmacist management services should include monitoring and evaluating the safety and efficacy of medications, providing strengthened care for special populations and other pharmaceutical care. For non-hospitalized or discharged patients, pharmacist management services should include formulating medication materials and establishing pharmacy management files for discharged patients. Conclusion: An evidence-based, patient-centered and entire-process-integrated pharmacist management strategy of the public and patients is established, which remedies the gaps in the existing patient management and can be implemented to support pharmacists' contributions to COVID-19 pandemic control.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
918,35087782,"Factors Associated With Medication Compliance in Elderly Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-Sectional Study.  The average age of patients with type 2 diabetes in Japan is over 70 years. Elderly patients tend to have poor medication compliance, therefore, it is important to understand their individual situations to improve medication compliance, the treatment of their diabetes, and their quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to identify factors associated with medication compliance in elderly type 2 diabetic patients. A cross-sectional study based on questionnaires was conducted on type 2 diabetes patients aged 65 years or older. The participants were recruited from patients who visited three dispensing pharmacies in the Shinagawa area of Tokyo between March 1 and September 30, 2019. The questionnaire consisted of patient information (sex, age, medication compliance status, knowledge of drug effects, and side effects), 12-Item Short Form Survey quality of life rating scale (SF-12), and Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Factors related to medication compliance were then evaluated. In all, there were 47 respondents: 31 males and 16 females. Four factors were found to be associated with medication compliance in elderly type 2 diabetic patients: medication storage (P = 0.01), knowledge of drug effects (P < 0.001), knowledge of side effects (P = 0.026), and physical functioning: (PF) (P = 0.045), a subscale of SF-12. Furthermore, the strength of the association between these four factors and medication compliance was calculated using Cramer's V coefficient of association. Knowledge of drug effects was the most strongly associated (knowledge of drug effects: V = 0.559; knowledge of side effects: V = 0.464; medication storage: V = 0.451; PF: V = 0.334). Because diabetes mellitus has no subjective symptoms and treatment effects are not felt to a great extent, it is difficult to motivate patients to consistently adhere to medication. When pharmacists provide medication guidance to elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is important to provide sufficient information to ensure they fully understand the drug effects to maintain medication compliance.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
919,35088067,"Evaluation of a remote hybrid staffing model for ambulatory clinical pharmacists in a pediatric health system during the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE To describe and quantify patient care activities performed by ambulatory clinical pharmacists supporting medical specialty clinics in a pediatric health system utilizing a hybrid staffing model during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS Five ambulatory clinical pharmacists, integrated within a health-system specialty pharmacy (HSSP), utilized a web-based data collection tool to record time spent performing patient care activities over a 2-week period. Work location (onsite or offsite) of the pharmacist was reported for each activity. Activities were classified as direct or indirect patient care. Direct patient care activities were subcategorized as telemedicine appointments, in-person clinic appointments, HSSP call center work, medication access support, electronic medical record consults, and previsit planning/postvisit documentation. Administrative tasks and precepting were considered indirect patient care activities. RESULTS A total of 1,190 activities were completed, with 77% of all activities performed offsite. Direct and indirect patient care activities accounted for 871 (73.2%) and 319 (26.8%) of total activities, respectively. No activity took longer for the pharmacists to complete offsite versus onsite. CONCLUSION Using a hybrid staffing model employed by a pediatric health system, ambulatory clinical pharmacists were able to efficiently provide a high volume of direct patient care activities even when working offsite.

Background Targeted interventions in community pharmacies, such as point-of-care C-reactive protein testing, could reduce inappropriate antimicrobial consumption in patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory tract infections, although data regarding Australian pharmacists' perspectives on its provision are limited. Aim To explore pharmacists' experiences and perspectives of point-of-care C-reactive protein testing, including barriers and facilitators, influencing service provision and uptake. Method A point-of-care C-reactive protein testing service for patients presenting with respiratory tract infection symptoms was trialled in five purposively selected community pharmacies in metropolitan Western Australia. Two pharmacists from each pharmacy participated in one-to-one semi-structured telephone interviews, regarding pharmacist demographics, pharmacy characteristics, experience with the point-of-care C-reactive protein service and training/resources. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were imported into NVivo for thematic analysis. Results Interview durations ranged from 28.2 to 60.2 min (mean: 50.7 ± 10.2 min). Of the five themes which emerged, participants reported the point-of-care C-reactive protein testing was simple, fast, reliable and accurate, assisted their clinical decision-making and contributed to antimicrobial stewardship. A major factor facilitating service provision and uptake by consumers was the accessibility and credibility of pharmacists. Barriers included time constraints and heavy documentation. Participants believed there was a public demand for the service. Conclusion Given the global antimicrobial resistance crisis, pharmacists have an important role in minimising the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. The point-of-care C-reactive protein service was readily accepted by the public when offered.

BACKGROUND Powders for oral solutions and suspensions (POS) are commonly used as pediatric oral medicines worldwide, except for Japan. Although global pediatric formulation development accelerates POS importation to Japan without any formulation change, oral solid multiparticulates remain to be the preferred pediatric forms in the country. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance situation of four typical POS form products (mycophenolate mofetil, sildenafil citrate, valganciclovir hydrochloride, and voriconazole) that were recently approved in Japan. METHODS A questionnaire on four products was completed by pharmacists in 29 children's hospitals with more than 100 beds each, between November and December of 2019. The questionnaire has six items on (#1) type of institution, (#2) formulary status, (#3) dispensing practice, (#4) reasons why POS form(s) were not selected as hospital formulary, (#5) advantages and disadvantages of POS form, and (#6) opinions for POS form. RESULTS Of the 29 institutions, 7 (24%), 9 (31%), 4 (13%), and 10 (34%) institutions used POS of mycophenolate mofetil, sildenafil citrate, valganciclovir hydrochloride, and voriconazole, respectively. Reasons for not using these products were dispensed drug loss, formulation issues, and management issues in the pharmaceutical department and pediatric ward. Pharmacists preferred drug compounding such as tablet crushing and capsule opening to POS form use. CONCLUSIONS POS forms might be an unsuitable formulation for the current hospital settings in Japan. Thus, appropriate dosage forms that reflect the current clinical settings are necessary.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multi-system disease that often requires otolaryngology care. Individuals with CF commonly suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis but also present with hearing loss and dysphonia. Given these manifestations of CF, otolaryngologists are frequently involved in the care of the CF patient; however, there is limited consensus on optimal management of sinonasal, otologic and laryngologic symptoms. METHODS The CF Foundation convened a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, audiologists, pharmacists, a social worker, a nurse coordinator, a respiratory therapist, two adults with CF, and a caregiver of a child with CF to develop consensus recommendations. Workgroups developed draft recommendation statements based on a systematic literature review and a ≥80% consensus was required for acceptance of each recommendation statement. RESULTS The committee voted on 25 statements. 11 statements were adopted recommending a treatment or intervention, while 5 statements were formulated recommending against a specific treatment or intervention. The committee recommended 8 statements as an option for select patients in certain circumstances, and 1 statement did not reach consensus. CONCLUSION These multidisciplinary consensus recommendations will help providers navigate decisions related to Otolaryngology consultation, medical and surgical management of CF-CRS, hearing, and voice in individuals with CF. A collaborative and multidisciplinary approach is advocated to best care for our CF patients.

924,35090479,"How to make the best use of the workload indicators of staffing needs method in determining the proportion of time spent in each of the workload components and its implication in decision making: the experience of the Sultanate of Oman. BACKGROUND The Ministry of Health in the Sultanate of Oman decided to have better distribution of the health workforce among all health facilities through evidenced-based staffing norms. Four directorates worked together to develop the staffing norms through making use of the workload indicators of staffing needs (WISN) method. The aim of this study is to describe the process of applying the WISN method in Primary Health Care institutions and how to make the best use of method in determining the proportion of time spent in each of the workload components and its implication in decision making. METHODS The WISN was applied for five priority categories, namely, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, and radiology technicians at PHC institutions. The WISN ratio has been translated into workload pressure as a percentage through applying the formula [workload pressure as % (in case of shortage) = (1 - WISN ratio) × 100%]. While the proportion of time spent in each of the workload components was calculated through making use of the category allowance standard, the individual allowance standard to determine the time spent in support and additional activities. The sum is subtracted from 100% to give the time spent in the health service activities. RESULTS Determining the workload pressure as a percent and its interpretation is based on the fact that one cadre or as a group can bear up to 10% of extra workload. Thus, managers can undertake sensible short-term arrangements or decisions in redistributing the cadres among the health facilities on expectation of deploying more staff. DISCUSSION Careful and detailed analysis of the proportion of time spent in each of the workload components will allow to have better understanding of the context and dynamics of work. CONCLUSION Decision makers and planners can undertake rational short-term decisions in redistributing the cadres among the health facilities based on the workload pressure. In addition, they can as well as easily decide on the optimal proportions of time for each staff category, and hence choose what activities and tasks to be shifted or delegated to other staff category.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
925,35090486,"Estimating staffing requirements using workload indicators of staffing need at Braun District Hospital in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. BACKGROUND Papua New Guinea has seen some improvements in health indicators over the past years, but the pace of improvements is not as robust as expected. The Health Services Plan for Braun District Hospital redevelopment identified the importance of reflecting the hospital's role in the broader health system, particularly in upgrading the services to service a bigger population. In August 2020, the hospital was upgraded from a health centre-level 3 to a district hospital level 4. The need for assessing human resources for health requirements for this level of care was thus necessary. METHODS The National Department of Health approved the use of the workload indicators of staffing need as the best tool to support in estimating staff requirements for the newly upgraded hospital. The focus was on clinical and non-clinical staff. Using already developed workload components and activity standards by the expert working groups for level 4 facilities, we visited the facility and collected data through interviews with the Lutheran Health Services representative, hospital management and staff. The technical task force reviewed daily registers, monthly reports and the data in the electronic national health information systems. The information collected was analysed using the workload indicators of staffing need software and interpreted. RESULTS There were staffing shortages among the clinical staff like the medical officers, nursing officers, health extension officers, pharmacists, radiology staff unit and in the laboratory staff. Shortages among the non-clinical staff were recorded by the cashiers, security officers, drivers and boat skippers. The results showed that the facility lacks a medical laboratory technologist, pharmacists and a medical imaging technologist. The community health workers in this facility are utilized in all the areas where shortages are registered to multitask. CONCLUSION The results from this WISN study provide evidence for basing staffing decisions on. The WISN results from Braun District Hospital show that the facility requires a total of 33 inpatient nurses against the existing 21 inpatient nurses thus giving a staff gap of - 12 and a WISN ratio of 0.67. It is thus recommended that the hospital management prioritizes recruitment of nurses or if no resources, reassign one of the outpatient nurses to alleviate the pressure among the inpatient nurses or the extra theatre nurses to offer some services in the inpatient wards. WISN results can help managers make decisions such as change of health facility status from a health centre to a district hospital.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
926,35090571,"A national study on the resilience of community pharmacists in Lebanon: a cross-sectional survey. BACKGROUND Community pharmacists are among the most accessible healthcare professionals and are likely to experience the full brunt of public health crises. In Lebanon, the COVID-19 pandemic, added to a severe economic meltdown, have significantly disrupted an already suffering profession. METHODS The objective of this study was to determine the level of resilience and its relationship to burnout, job satisfaction, intention to quit, and changes in practice. The study utilized a cross-sectional design to survey community pharmacists using an online questionnaire that included the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. All community pharmacists were invited to participate. Multiple logistic regression identified variables significantly associated with the resilience of pharmacists. RESULTS A total of 459 community pharmacists completed the questionnaire. Respondents had a relatively low resilience level (68.0 ± 13.37). They also had higher scores on the client-related burnout (58.06 ± 17.46), followed by the personal burnout (56.51 ± 16.68) and the work-related burnout (55.75 ± 13.82). In this sample, 52.3% of pharmacists indicated that they are dissatisfied with their job and 41.1% indicated an intention to quit in the coming year. According to multivariate analysis, marital status (ß = 0.38; 95% CI 0.16-0.91; p = 0.03), intention to quit (ß = 0.384; 95% CI 0.149-0.987; p = 0.047), workload (ß = 0.275; 95% CI 0.096-0.783; p = 0.016), perception of safety (ß = 0.267; 95% CI 0.078-0.909; p = 0.035), and personal burnout (ß = 0.321; 95% CI 0.152-0.677; p = 0.003) were independent influencing factors for resilience. CONCLUSIONS Multiple challenges and crises have culminated to the low job satisfaction, high burnout, and high the intention to quit of community pharmacists. This seriously destabilized the labor market of pharmacists which could negatively affect public safety. Effective interventions are essential to enhance the well-being and job satisfaction of pharmacists during public health crisis.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
927,35090814,"Use of medication regimen complexity to target services in the community. BACKGROUND In the community, successful medication therapy depends on patients managing complex medication regimens. To assist, pharmacists can sort patients on the basis of their regimen complexity and then tailor care appropriately. OBJECTIVES Objectives were to (1) develop a medication regimen complexity score and assess its reliability and validity, (2) design and implement a Less Complex program to tailor medication management services to the complexity of medication regimens, and (3) evaluate the impact that a Less Complex program had on identification and resolution of medication-related problems (MRPs). METHODS Patients in the Less Complex program were stratified into complexity categories on the basis of Iowa Medication Complexity Scores (IMECSs) to receive pharmacy services tailored to their complexity category. Types and numbers of MRPs identified and associated pharmacist interventions were extracted. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were calculated. To assess the reliability and validity of the IMECS, a stratified random sample of 125 patients was drawn. For each of these patients, baseline and end of 9-month scores for IMECS were compared with Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) scores using paired t tests. RESULTS A total of 661 patients had both baseline and post-IMECSs. The mean IMECS for the sample of 661 patients decreased from 28.6 at baseline to 27.3 during the postperiod. For the stratified sample (n = 113), the MRCI showed a nonsignificant change from baseline to the end of treatment period, whereas the IMECS showed a statistically significant decrease from baseline to the end of treatment period. A total of 10,535 MRPs and 10,482 interventions were documented during the 9-month treatment period for 1019 patients. CONCLUSION Evidence supported initial reliability and validity of the IMECS. The Less Complex program identified and addressed many MRPs by matching patient complexity to service type. Future work is needed to evaluate a similar approach in other pharmacies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
928,35090815,"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in community pharmacists: A longitudinal study. BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively affected the mental health of frontline health care workers, including pharmacists. OBJECTIVES The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in French owner community pharmacists. METHODS We conducted a postal-based survey to assess the psychological difficulties of the COVID-19 outbreak in French owner community pharmacists based on 3 psychologically validated self-report questionnaires: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R), and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The baseline assessment was during the first sanitary lockdown period and the second one 5 months later. RESULTS The sample consists of 135 owner community pharmacists. At follow-up, 67 answered the questionnaires (response rate: 49.6%). The mean scores of the PSS and IES-R significantly decreased (P = 0.002). Fifteen pharmacists reported significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (23.1%) at baseline and 11 at follow-up (16.4%, P = 0.02). Age and sex were not significantly associated with persistent posttraumatic stress or burnout symptoms. CONCLUSION This is the first longitudinal study that showed the psychological impact of owner community pharmacists as health care workers dealing with their community's COVID-19 outbreak. Based on validated self-report questionnaires, stress, posttraumatic stress, and burnout symptoms decreased during follow-up. It is necessary to continue monitoring psychological difficulties for health care workers, especially during consecutive waves of the COVID-19 outbreak.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
929,35090816,"An exploration of the mental health and well-being of postgraduates in pharmacy and pharmaceutical science programs. BACKGROUND Postgraduate students enrolled at colleges and schools of pharmacy are at an increased risk of experiencing difficulties with mental health and well-being; however, there is minimal work exploring mental health and well-being among postgraduates in pharmacy and pharmaceutical science programs. OBJECTIVES (1) to explore the current mental health and well-being of pharmacy postgraduates, (2) to identify factors that promote and hinder mental well-being at the individual and organizational levels, and (3) to explore perspectives regarding organizational priorities, resources, and support tools that may improve the mental health and well-being of postgraduates in pharmacy and pharmaceutical science programs. METHODS This study conducted a cross-sectional survey of postgraduates in pharmacy and pharmaceutical science programs. Surveys were distributed electronically via the American Pharmacists Association's (APhA) broadcast e-mail system to postgraduate members and through the professional networks of APhA Academy of Pharmaceutical Research and Science (APhA-APRS) Postgraduate Advisory Committee members. The survey had 3 sections: demographics, current mental health and well-being status, and barriers and facilitators to mental health and well-being. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were generated for quantitative survey responses. Open-ended responses were categorized and presented with each question. RESULTS Fifty-one responses were analyzed. The sample had a mean age of 29.0 ± 6.6 years, included 58.8% women or womxn, and most were in doctoral programs (58.8%) for 2.3 ± 2.7 years in various disciplines. There were 27.5% of respondents categorized as having flourishing mental health and 7.8% with languishing mental health. Factors such as practicing self-care or engaging in hobbies (94.1% for each) were most commonly rated as having a positive impact on well-being, and societal racism and discrimination (66.7%) was most commonly reported as having a negative effect on well-being. Top priorities for postgraduates included work-life balance, career prospects, meaningful relationships, and financial concerns. CONCLUSION There are a number of organizational and institutional priorities that may improve pharmacy and pharmaceutical science graduate students' mental health and well-being.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
930,35091845,"A randomised controlled trial of clinical pharmacy intervention versus standard care to improve medication adherence in outpatients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy. PURPOSE Patient understanding of medicines information and adherence to medication instructions are important variables for ensuring optimal cancer care. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the impact of an outpatient clinical pharmacy service on medication adherence and symptom burden in cancer patients. METHODS In this single-centre RCT, 115 patients were randomised 1:1 to a pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care program (intervention, n = 59) versus standard of care (control, n = 56) within an outpatient multidisciplinary radiotherapy clinic. The primary endpoint was medication adherence as assessed by Medication Understanding and Use Self-Efficacy (MUSE) scale and Teach-Back assessment. Secondary endpoints were patient-reported symptom burden assessed by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). Patients were assessed at baseline (weeks 1-2) and at discharge from radiotherapy (weeks 5-7). RESULTS Polypharmacy (use of five or more medications) was observed in 26% of patients at baseline compared to 97% at discharge. Patient self-efficacy and medication adherence was higher in the intervention arm compared to the control arm, with a mean MUSE score difference of 2.70 (95% CI 1.24, 4.17) after adjustment for baseline, and a higher proportion of patients with average Teach-Back score of four or more (86% vs 14%; odds ratio (OR) 46.09, 95% CI 14.49, 146.56). The mean (SD) scores for aggregate ESAS (0-100) at discharge were 26.2 (14.0) in the intervention arm and 32.0 (15.8) in the control arm demonstrating lower overall symptom burden associated with the intervention (mean score difference adjusted for baseline - 0.52; 95% CI - 1.03, - 0.01).

931,35092116,"Nurses' perceptions of their role in antimicrobial stewardship within the hospital environment. An integrative literature review. BACKGROUND Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) has traditionally been the domain of doctors and pharmacists but there is a growing recognition that successful stewardship incorporates a multidisciplinary approach that includes nursing staff. This literature review explores nurses' perceptions of their role in antimicrobial stewardship within the hospital environment and provides new insights to inform future practice. METHODOLOGY An integrative literature review was undertaken. Five academic databases were searched, which identified six relevant studies. Whittemore and Knafl's method for conducting an integrative review was followed. ENTREQ guidelines have been adhered to. FINDINGS Two themes were identified: nurses' working in partnership with other professionals and engagement in education. DISCUSSION Antimicrobial stewardship illustrates the role of the nurse within the wider multidisciplinary team regarding wider patient safety issues and the need for education to enhance this role. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nurses have a clear role to play in antimicrobial stewardship but need to be fully cognisant of the issues involved. Further clarity on how nurses should enact this role in their complex working environments is required. It is essential that both student and qualified nurses are able to speak up in order to maximise patient safety, fulfil their professional duty and promote the overall effectiveness of AMS if they witness poor antibiotic management practices.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
932,35092566,"Efficacy and safety of app-based remote warfarin management during COVID-19-related lockdown: a retrospective cohort study.  This study aimed to explore the effectiveness, and safety of internet-based warfarin management during the pandemic. In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we compared the safety and efficacy of online warfarin management using a smartphone app (the Alfalfa app) versus conventional outpatient clinic management from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020. Patients in the online management group used the Alfalfa app to communicate coagulation test results and other relevant information to a doctor or clinical pharmacist, who then responded with the dose adjustment plan and the date of the next blood test. The outcomes examined were the time in therapeutic range (TTR), incidence of clinical events (i.e., bleeding events, thrombotic events, warfarin-related emergency department visits, and warfarin-related hospital admissions), and the distribution of international normalized ratio (INR) values. Data from 117 patients were analyzed in this study. TTR was significantly higher in the online group than in the offline group (61.0% vs. 39.6%, P < 0.01). Incidence of major bleeding events, thrombotic events, and warfarin-related hospital admissions were comparable between the online and offline groups. However, minor bleeds (5.3% vs. 28.3%, P < 0.01) and warfarin-related emergency department visits (1.8% vs. 23.3%, P = 0.02) were significantly fewer in the online group than in the offline group. The proportion of INR values in the therapeutic range (53.8% vs. 40.1%, P < 0.01) was significantly higher in the online group. Warfarin management using the Alfalfa app appears to be a safe and effective method for warfarin management when patients cannot physically visit hospitals for follow-up.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
933,35092599,"Pharmacist-Led Management Improves Treatment Adherence and Quality of Life in Opioid-Tolerant Patients With Cancer Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial. INTRODUCTION Opioid-tolerant patients are more likely to deviate from recommended treatments and to experience inadequate analgesia than opioid-naive ones. The aim of this study was to examine whether pharmacist-led management could help improve treatment adherence and quality of life. METHODS Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to control group and intervention group. The control group received routine education and support, while the intervention group received additional individualized pharmacist-led care. The primary endpoint was treatment adherence in the per-protocol analysis, as evaluated by blinded assessors. An interim analysis was planned when 30% patients completed the study. Alpha was divided into the interim analysis (0.015) and the final analysis (0.035). RESULTS In the interim analysis (97 and 87 patients in the control and intervention groups, respectively), the primary endpoint was met. Pharmacist-led intervention significantly increased treatment adherence (93.3 vs. 79.8%; OR: 2.25; 95% CI 1.02, 4.94; P = 0.013), quality of life (0.81 ± 0.17 vs. 0.72 ± 0.25; P = 0.008), and reporting of adverse events (82.7 vs. 61.9%; OR: 1.88; 95% CI 1.16, 3.07; P = 0.004). The two groups did not differ in pain control rate (66.7 vs. 57.1%; OR: 1.25; 95% CI 0.87, 1.78; P = 0.218), breakthrough pain-free rate (66.7 vs. 61.9%; OR: 1.12; 95% CI 0.78, 1.59; P = 0.532) and pain score (1.97 ± 1.04 vs. 2.15 ± 1.24; P = 0.522).

The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends numerous antibiotics for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of oral step-down antibiotics compared to continued IV therapy in UTIs without bacteremia. This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized patients with ESBL-producing UTIs between July 2016 and March 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause clinical failure: 30-day readmission, hospital mortality, or a change in oral antibiotics during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include: primary outcome components, readmission due to a recurrent UTI, change in antibiotic during hospitalization, hospital length of stay, antibiotic costs, and adverse events. The study included 153 patients. The primary outcome occurred in 28% of both groups (27/95 vs. 16/58, p=0.91). The primary outcome components were similar: readmission (93% vs. 94%, p=0.95), recurrent UTIs (33% vs. 25%, p=0.73), hospital mortality (7% vs. 6%, p=1.0), and change in antibiotics (0% vs. 2%, p=0.38). Mean length of stay and direct antibiotic cost were 9.7±6.2 vs. 5.2±2.8 days (p<0.01) and $296±190 vs. $183±84 (p<0.01), respectively. Adverse events were similar except diarrhea (15% vs. 2%, p=0.01). There was no difference in clinical failure, readmission rate, mortality rate, or antibiotic change between groups.

935,35093037,"Mental Health First Aid training and assessment in Australian medical, nursing and pharmacy curricula: a national perspective using content analysis. BACKGROUND Suicide is among the leading causes of death among people aged 15 to 29 worldwide. Healthcare professionals interact with people at risk of suicide regularly, yet mental health and crisis first aid training is lacking in curricula. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training teaches crucial communication and crisis first aid skills and is increasingly recognised as integral to healthcare education. This study aimed to explore the extent of, as well as barriers and enablers to MHFA training delivery and assessment in Australian medical, nursing and pharmacy curricula. METHODS All accredited Australian medical, nursing and pharmacy program providers were identified through Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and National Boards websites and invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. A purpose-designed interview guide explored if and how MHFA training was delivered and assessed in curricula, as well as perceptions of and barriers and enablers to MHFA training. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim, allowing for deductive content analysis to compare MHFA training provision across programs. RESULTS Of 75 invited program providers, 36 (48%; 13 medical, 13 nursing and 10 pharmacy) participated, of which 15 representatives (42%; six medical, two nursing and six pharmacy) reported providing MHFA training to students. Differences in mandating training, year level of students completing training, type of training delivered and source of MHFA instructors were identified. Barriers to MHFA implementation included perceived adequacy of existing curricula, lack of funding and time, while facilitators included perceived benefit and availability of funding. CONCLUSION MHFA training is provided to more than one third of medical, nursing and pharmacy students in Australia. Increased funding may facilitate the integration of MHFA as a minimum standard of mental health training for future healthcare professionals. Further research exploring the effectiveness of MHFA in improving behaviours and its impact on patient outcomes is warranted.

936,35093049,"Over-the-counter sale of antibiotics during COVID-19 outbreak by community pharmacies in Saudi Arabia: a simulated client study. BACKGROUND Recent studies have reflected increased global concern regarding the possible acceleration of bacterial resistance secondary to the reported overuse and misuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the nonprescribed sale of antibiotics by community pharmacies in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 outbreak and the pharmacists' skills in triaging COVID-19 suspects. METHODS Herein, 120 pharmacies were randomly selected and surveyed by simulated clients who presented gradual demands to convince the encountered pharmacists to agree to the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. The pharmacists' responses and counseling skills were documented in addition to their effectiveness in triaging suspected COVID-19 cases. RESULTS Nineteen pharmacists (15.8%) were convinced to sell nonprescribed antibiotics after various levels of demand by clients. Moreover, twenty pharmacists (16.7%), who refused to sell nonprescribed antibiotics, referred the clients to clinics where they could easily obtain prescriptions, or to other pharmacies that violate the system. In addition, 29 pharmacists (24.2%) were not concerned about possible COVID-19 suspects, and 47-66 (39.2-55%) of them demonstrated different responses and recommendations. Moreover, 12 pharmacists of the 19 who violated the law did not offer any counseling regarding the use of the antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS The nonprescribed sale of antibiotics is still prevalent and may have increased during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, thereby increasing the risk of accelerated bacterial resistance. The pharmacists' skills in triaging COVID-19 suspects and patient education and counseling were below expectations. Further follow-up studies are highly recommended.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
937,35093205,"Hyperimmune immunoglobulin for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (ITAC): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, randomised trial. BACKGROUND Passive immunotherapy using hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) to SARS-CoV-2, derived from recovered donors, is a potential rapidly available, specific therapy for an outbreak infection such as SARS-CoV-2. Findings from randomised clinical trials of hIVIG for the treatment of COVID-19 are limited. METHODS In this international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who had been symptomatic for up to 12 days and did not have acute end-organ failure were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either hIVIG or an equivalent volume of saline as placebo, in addition to remdesivir, when not contraindicated, and other standard clinical care. Randomisation was stratified by site pharmacy; schedules were prepared using a mass-weighted urn design. Infusions were prepared and masked by trial pharmacists; all other investigators, research staff, and trial participants were masked to group allocation. Follow-up was for 28 days. The primary outcome was measured at day 7 by a seven-category ordinal endpoint that considered pulmonary status and extrapulmonary complications and ranged from no limiting symptoms to death. Deaths and adverse events, including organ failure and serious infections, were used to define composite safety outcomes at days 7 and 28. Prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out for efficacy and safety outcomes by duration of symptoms, the presence of anti-spike neutralising antibodies, and other baseline factors. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received all or part of the assigned study product infusion. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04546581. FINDINGS From Oct 8, 2020, to Feb 10, 2021, 593 participants (n=301 hIVIG, n=292 placebo) were enrolled at 63 sites in 11 countries; 579 patients were included in the mITT analysis. Compared with placebo, the hIVIG group did not have significantly greater odds of a more favourable outcome at day 7; the adjusted OR was 1·06 (95% CI 0·77-1·45; p=0·72). Infusions were well tolerated, although infusion reactions were more common in the hIVIG group (18·6% vs 9·5% for placebo; p=0·002). The percentage with the composite safety outcome at day 7 was similar for the hIVIG (24%) and placebo groups (25%; OR 0·98, 95% CI 0·66-1·46; p=0·91). The ORs for the day 7 ordinal outcome did not vary for subgroups considered, but there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect for the day 7 composite safety outcome: risk was greater for hIVIG compared with placebo for patients who were antibody positive (OR 2·21, 95% CI 1·14-4·29); for patients who were antibody negative, the OR was 0·51 (0·29-0·90; pinteraction=0·001). INTERPRETATION When administered with standard of care including remdesivir, SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG did not demonstrate efficacy among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 without end-organ failure. The safety of hIVIG might vary by the presence of endogenous neutralising antibodies at entry. FUNDING US National Institutes of Health.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
938,35093409,"Randomised single centre double-blind placebo controlled phase II trial of Tocovid SupraBio in combination with pentoxifylline in patients suffering long-term gastrointestinal adverse effects of radiotherapy for pelvic cancer: the PPALM study. BACKGROUND Preclinical data suggest that combined gamma-tocotrienol with pentoxifylline ameliorates radiotherapy-induced gastrointestinal damage. AIM To test whether gastrointestinal symptoms arising after radiotherapy, and persisting after maximal medical therapy, can be improved using Tocovid SupraBio 200mg and pentoxifylline 400mg orally twice daily for one year. Patients stratified by severity of symptoms, and randomised to active treatment or matched placebo were assessed after 12 months. The primary end point was improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms measured using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, bowel subset score. Changes in bio-markers of fibrosis were assessed. RESULTS 62 patients, median age 66, 34(55%) treated for prostate, 21(34%) gynaecological, 6(10%) anal and one(1%) rectal cancer were recruited; 40(65%) randomised to treatment, 22(35%) to placebo, 39 months (median) after radiotherapy completion. Gamma tocotrienol was not detected in serum in 41% of treated patients, despite good compliance with study medication. Treatment was completed in 28(70%) and 17(77%) patients in the treatment and placebo groups respectively. No improvement in symptom scores nor in quality of life was identified. Thirteen serious adverse events occurred. A transient ischaemic attack, was possibly related to pentoxifylline, others were assessed as unlikely to be related to treatment. Levels of EGF, PDGF and FGF were significantly reduced and consistent trends in reduced inflammation were seen during treatment but were not sustained once treatment ended. SUMMARY This single centre study closed prematurely and therefore data interpretation is of necessity limited. No clinical benefit was demonstrated.

941,35094908,"Nasal irrigation practice habits in infants: A Belgian survey: Nasal irrigation practice habits in infants. BACKGROUND Nasal irrigation is widely used in infants to relieve nasal obstruction. However, the nasal irrigation technique has not been standardized, and nasal irrigation practice habits (NIPH) in infants have not been investigated. Our objective was to provide an overview of NIPH in infants among parents, childcare workers, and healthcare professionals living in Belgium. METHODS Parents, childcare workers, physiotherapists, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians were invited to fill in an electronic survey questioning their NIPH in infants. The survey was disseminated through social networks, practitioners' associations, and creches. RESULTS The questionnaire was fully completed by 359 participants. A ready-made solution was used by 93% of participants, of whom 92% used physiological saline. The prophylactic use of nasal irrigation was considered appropriate or very appropriate by 65% of all participants. The irrigation frequency was particularly heterogeneous among participants. The optimal solution propulsion speed and solution volume to be used depended on the group of participants being interviewed. At least 37% of parents and 20% of physicians did not take a stand on the optimal irrigation volume to use in each age category. On average, 83% of participants described performing nasal irrigation by lying the infant on one side and delivering the solution through the top nostril. Finally, 74% of respondents declared that no risk was associated with this technique. CONCLUSION Although some common NIPH viewpoints among the surveyed participants were identified, several disagreements were reported, reflecting the absence of a standardized method of nasal irrigation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Telemedicine is employed in patient care when direct physical contact is not possible or discouraged, as was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of smartphone technology could make telemedicine affordable and available in low and medium-income countries (LMICs). However, the evolution of telemedicine care depends on multiple factors. Aim To explore the practice of telemedicine by Nigerian health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study of the Nigerian HCWs on telemedicine practice in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Recruitment of respondents was done through dedicated WhatsApp and Telegram social media platforms for HCWs over a period of 40 days (May 1st and June 10th, 2020). Results A total of 481 HCWs participated in the study consisting of 153(31.8%) doctors, 150(31.2%) nurses and 178(37%) other HCWs. Though 89.2% of the HCWs agreed that telemedicine is important, it was only 266 (55.3%) that practiced telemedicine, phone consultation was the form of telemedicine used in all the health institutions. Telemedicine was practiced more by doctors 91(18.9%), nurses 79(16.4%) and pharmacists 35(7.3%) than other groups of health care workers. Inadequate COVID-19 screening test and lack of personal protective equipment were strong motivators for the attending HCWs to practice telemedicine. Conclusion There was widespread use of phone consultation by all cadres of health care workers during the pandemic. Hence there should be a health policy that will encourage greater use and acceptance of telemedicine in clinical practice and in the patients care beyond the pandemic period.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

946,35096400,"Availability and role of clinical pharmacists in ambulatory neuro-oncology. Background Outpatient clinics treating neuro-oncology patients are becoming more multidisciplinary. Utilization of all team members is critical for the holistic care of these complex patients. Specifically, the role of clinical pharmacist (CP) in the ambulatory clinic remains undefined and will likely evolve as more therapeutics are developed for CNS malignancies. We queried the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) membership about the availability of a CP in their ambulatory setting and, if present, the role of that CP. Methods In an IRB-exempt study, we surveyed the SNO community and analyzed responses to queries about CPs in the ambulatory setting. Results Of the 65 SNO members who responded, 52 were clinical members. Of these 52 clinicians, the majority were physicians (88.5%, n = 46). Of these physicians, most were in academic practices (93.5%, n = 43). Over half of the 52 clinical respondents (51.9%, n = 27) reported that they saw ≥30 primary brain tumor patients per month, thus typifying busy clinics. Despite having busy clinics, only 12 (28.6%) of 42 providers with access to a CP reported that their CP was solely dedicated to neuro-oncology patients. For the respondents who had access to a CP, only ~two-thirds of those CPs had direct patient interaction. The top 3 roles of the CP included medication review, chemotherapy dosing/modifications, and practice guideline development; none of which involve direct patient interaction. Conclusions We found that while our surveyed population of SNO clinical members have demanding outpatient practices, most do not have the support or expertise of dedicated neuro-oncology CPs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

948,35098745,"Association between health system specialty pharmacy use and health care costs among national sample of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.  BACKGROUND: Health care expenditures are growing rapidly. There is a growing body of literature showing that health system specialty pharmacy is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes; however, there is a lack of data on its effect on health care costs and utilization. OBJECTIVE: To perform exploratory research assessing the association between health system specialty pharmacy use and health care costs and utilization. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted examining medical and pharmacy claims from 2018 and 2019 of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Optum Advisory Service's proprietary deidentified Normative Health Information database was used, which includes claims, membership, and provider data for 12.6 million Medicare Advantage members. Members who filled a prescription at a health system specialty pharmacy and had a specialty provider participating in the health system specialty pharmacy care model in clinic were assigned to the intervention group. Members who did not use a health system specialty pharmacy but had the same provider (provider benchmark group) or different provider (network benchmark group) were considered as comparisons. The network benchmark group was further refined to match variation in health care cost due to geography. The primary outcome measure was total health care costs (across the medical and pharmacy benefit) on a per-patient per-month basis. Secondary outcomes were selected utilization drivers and cost subcomponents. Cost and utilization metrics were calculated on a risk-adjusted basis using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (CMS-HCC) risk score methodology. Differences were assessed for categorical variables with chi-square tests, and 2-tailed t-tests were used for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of the analytic sample of 9,780 members used in this study, 208 (2.1%) used health system specialty pharmacy services. During the 2018 baseline period, total health care costs and utilization were similar after CMS-HCC risk score adjustment ($9,520 among health system specialty pharmacy users; $8,691 among the provider benchmark group; $9,510 among the network benchmark group) but lower in 2019 ($7,060, $7,683, and $8,152, respectively). The differences in 2019 were primarily driven by savings in pharmacy and free-standing physician-related costs. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a health system specialty pharmacy is associated with a lower health care cost. Further study is required to analyze how drug and disease-specific interactions influence total health care costs and utilization for health system specialty pharmacy populations.

949,35099344,"The Prevalence of Polypharmacy and Potential Drug-Drug Interactions among Iranian Cancer Patients: which Patients Were at Risk? INTRODUCTION Drug-Drug interactions (DDIs) are one of the considerable consequences of polypharmacy. Due to the influence of polypharmacy and drug interactions on cancer treatment and patients` health outcomes, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of polypharmacy and potential DDIs among adult cancer patients in Kerman province, southeast of Iran. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 315 cancer patients who referred to Kerman city oncology clinics were assessed in 2018. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical charts were reviewed. Polypharmacy was defined as the use of at least five drugs simultaneously. Potential DDIs were checked using the ""Drugs.com"" online database. A bivariable and a multivariable logistic regression were used to determine the associated factors of outcome variables, polypharmacy status and potential DDI in SPSS software version 23. RESULTS Of 315 cancer patients, 191 patients (60.6%; 95% CI:54.9, 66) used at least five drugs during chemotherapy courses. The prevalence of potential DDIs was 59.6% (n = 140, 95% CI: 53.6-66.0. Experience co-morbid diseases (OR:6.60; 95%CI: 3.82, 11.42; P-value ≤0.0001), and positive metastatic status (OR:2.80; 95%CI: 1.62, 4.82; P-value ≤0.0001) could predict the polypharmacy during chemotherapy courses. Patients who suffered gastrointestinal cancers (OR:5.55; 95%CI: 2.26, 13.62; P-value ≤0.0001) and the number of prescribed or Over The Counter (OTC) drugs (OR:1.29; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.48; P-value <0.0001) predicted the occurrence of potential DDIs among cancer patients. CONCLUSION Regarding the high prevalence of polypharmacy and potential drug interactions among Iranian cancer patients during chemotherapy courses, it is advisable for physicians, nurses, and pharmacists to be vigilant to improve prescribing patterns. In addition, with intensive monitoring, alternative treatment strategies can be replaced.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
950,35100089,"Policies regarding use of medications for opioid use disorder in professional recovery programs: A scoping review.  Background: In the U.S., medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) include methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Despite substantial evidence of efficacy, the use of MOUD by health professionals remains controversial. This scoping review sought to identify and describe policies related to the use of MOUD by physicians, pharmacists, and nurses in professional health programs (PHP). Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed in August 2020 to identify pertinent articles from the U.S. which were then evaluated for inclusion by a team of trained reviewers. Results: Nine articles were ultimately identified for inclusion, and their years of publication ranged from 1984 to 2012. The treatment of physicians was addressed in seven articles, nurses in four, and pharmacists in two. Data from one veterinarian and several dentists could not be disaggregated from three studies. Naltrexone was the most commonly accepted form of MOUD within PHPs. A 2011 survey of physician and nurse PHP administrators found that 11/22 (50%) physician programs and 15/33 (45%) nursing programs forbade practice reentry while taking buprenorphine with the remainder indicating it could be allowed under some circumstances. The use of methadone within PHPs was extremely rare, and no specific details regarding PHP policies related to its use or practice reentry could be identified. No articles reported specifically on practice reentry policies for pharmacists. Conclusions: This scoping review identified one article detailing explicit policies concerning MOUD use in the target professions. Implicit policies extrapolated from other articles found that naltrexone was the most commonly accepted form of MOUD, with methadone and buprenorphine being avoided due to dubious concerns of impairment. A unified, contemporary, comprehensive survey of current PHP policies and evaluation of actual treatment data to ascertain real-world practices is needed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
951,35101135,"Analysis of the variable factors affecting changes in the blood concentration of cyclosporine before and after transfusion of red blood cell concentrate. BACKGROUND The blood concentration of cyclosporine (CyA) is frequently elevated following the transfusion of red blood cell concentrate (RCC) to patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The aim of this retrospective study was to identify the variable factors affecting changes in the blood concentration of CyA before and after transfusion of RCC. METHODS We enrolled 105 patients (age, 5-66 years) who received both CyA and transfusion after HSCT. The ratio of the measurement after transfusion to the measurement before transfusion was calculated for the hematocrit and blood concentration/dose ratio of CyA (termed the HCT ratio and the CyA ratio, respectively). RESULTS The blood concentration/dose ratio of CyA was increased after transfusion compared with before transfusion (P < 0.001). The HCT ratio was significantly correlated with the CyA ratio (P = 0.23, P < 0.001). The HCT ratio, concomitant medication that could elevate CyA concentration after RCC transfusion, and difference in the alkaline phosphatase level between before and after transfusion (ΔALP) were explanatory variables associated with the variation in the CyA ratio. There was no correlation between the CyA concentration after transfusion and the change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSIONS A change in the blood concentration/dose ratio of CyA was found to be associated with a change in the HCT, concomitant medication that could elevate CyA concentration after RCC transfusion, and ALP levels. If the HCT level rises significantly after RCC transfusion, clinicians and pharmacists should pay attention to changes in the blood CyA concentration.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives To evaluate the interest in the MyDéfi application as a tool to help pharmacists identify and manage excessive alcohol consumption, as well as their perception and knowledge of alcohol and their possible role in its management. METHODS Prospective mixed qualitative and quantitative study, based on face-to-face semi-directive interviews. RESULTS The 101 pharmacists interviewed in the Hauts-de-France region considered that the detection of alcohol consumption was part of their mission, even if it is a difficult subject, and that they had received specific training in alcoholology during their university education. Only 12% were aware of early screening and brief intervention on alcohol. Several obstacles were mentioned, such as the lack of training and confidentiality, and difficulties related to the particularities of the patients. 41% said that the pharmacy was not suitable and almost 72% said that the MyDéfi application could be useful for screening and 91% would recommend the application as one of the best supports, easy to advise with a personalised follow-up. For 32%, the application is accessible to patients (40% think that the main drawback of the application is inaccessibility and 27% its cost). CONCLUSION Pharmacists consider that excessive alcohol use is a major problem that should mobilise them but many do not feel ready to offer brief interventions.

953,35101858,"An Innovation Sprint to Promote Problem-solving and Interprofessional Skills Among Pharmacy and Public Health Students.  Objective. Innovation sprints are a novel pedagogy where small groups of students find creative solutions to problems. The purpose of this study was to extend our understanding of innovation sprint pedagogical design by investigating the impact of an innovation sprint on pharmacy (PharmD) and public health (MPH) students' interprofessional (IP) collaboration and problem-solving skills. We hypothesized that the innovation sprint would increase student self-efficacy and that IP collaborative behaviors would be demonstrated by individuals on a team.Methods. MPH and professional year 3 PharmD students were assigned to teams and participated in a required two-hour innovation sprint. Faculty observed student teams and evaluated their IP collaboration skills using a rubric modeled after the Modified McMaster-Ottawa scale. Students completed a post-program survey assessing their IP collaborative behaviors and attitudes toward the innovation sprint.Results. Of the 133 students participating in the innovation sprint, 127 completed the post-program survey (response rate=95%). Faculty determined 123 students (92%) met the IP collaboration competencies. The mean interprofessional collaborative competencies attainment survey scores increased for both PharmD and MPH students. Qualitative analyses highlighted themes of IP collaboration and problem-solving skills that students valued. Overall, students enjoyed working with each other and engaging in creative problem-solving.Conclusion. An IP innovation sprint involving PharmD and MPH students demonstrated a positive impact on student self-assessed IP collaboration and problem-solving skills. Further, faculty observed a high rate of IP behaviors within student teams. Based on these findings, an innovation sprint may be an effective pedagogical tool to enhance students' skills in these areas.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
954,35101859,"Professionalism Flows From Both The Profession's Identity and One's Professional Identity, But They Are Different.  Pharmacy schools have taught professionalism for many years, but are now discussing the model of professional identity formation adopted by academic medicine. The former is an outward expression of a community's norms while the latter is an internalization of those norms such that one thinks, acts, and feels like a member of the community. Some have expressed concern that the wide-ranging roles and responsibilities of pharmacists mean there is no universal identity for the pharmacy profession and that a student's professional identity therefore cannot be easily developed. This commentary suggests that the profession's identity is an outward expression to patients and other health care providers of what pharmacists do, while one's professional identity is an internal acceptance that being a pharmacist is who one is. The former may make the latter easier to develop, but is not required to begin guiding student pharmacists in the formation of their professional identity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction: Pemphigus Vulgaris is a rare, noncommunicable, non-hereditary fatal autoimmune dermatological manifestation in which a painful blister initiates from the oral cavity. PRIDE complex stands for Papulopustules or paronychia, regulatory abnormality of hair and nails, itching, and dryness due to inhibition of EGFR. Both of these mucocutaneous manifestations are rare and are often caused by drugs. Case report: Our case reports 53-year-old patient presented with multiple crusted plaques, multiple hyperpigmented macules to patches, Solitary fluid-filled lesions on several parts of the body, and numerous erosions positive over buccal mucosa on initial follow up which was diagnosed as Pemphigus Vulgaris with PRIDE complex induced by Gefitinib. Management and outcome: The patient was treated with almost all possible treatment options, i.e., both steroids plus adjuvant therapy for pemphigus and antihistaminic, antibiotics, moisturizer, and lotions for PRIDE complex. The patient was initially admitted for infusion of the first dose of rituximab and later for management of flare-up condition and infusion of the second dose of rituximab infusion.

The ambulatory setting presents unique challenges for leadership and staff transitioning from other care areas, such as the inpatient environment. Nurses and support staff newly entering the world of ambulatory care may experience challenges acclimating to their new roles as they shift from an environment that provides focused care to achieve a safe discharge to one that focuses on holistic prevention and treatment over long periods. Inpatient hospital care relies on many protocols, orders, and guidelines and a multidisciplinary team of physicians, pharmacists, dieticians, and rehabilitation support to progress the patient through their illness or injury during their hospital admission. Nurses in ambulatory care have increased responsibility and autonomy in patient care. New challenges are encountered, for example, transportation to appointments, socioeconomic challenges, immediate resource needs, and patient support for future success in their own environment. In these situations, the ambulatory nurse is an immediate caregiver and a case manager, providing direct patient care for a short period, but following up over a longer period, in some cases, years.

The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment strategy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with activating EGFR mutations, ALK or ROS-1 gene rearrangements. The Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have approved several inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer : five tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, osimertinib and dacomitinib) and six tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting ALK (crizotinib, céritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib and entrectinib). Interestingly, these tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments are administered orally. While this route of administration improves the treatment flexibility and provides a comfortable and preferable option for patients, it also increases the risk of drug-drug interactions. The latter may result in changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors or their concomitant treatments, with subsequent risks of increasing their toxicity and/or reducing their effectiveness.

In Europe, pharmacists often use a volume-based method whereas, in the USA, the weight-based method prevails. These two methods should be compared in order to help hospital pharmacists to make their choice. METHODS We evaluated the difference between the volume-based method and the weight-based method with 10 mg spironolactone capsules. Six independent batches were made with each technique and their conformity was evaluated with a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. RESULTS The weight-based method showed superiority over the volume-based method for the following parameters: spironolactone content homogeneity, total weight content homogeneity, batch reproducibility and batch conformity. No differences were seen in spironolactone content between the two methods, but an overall trend towards underweighing the excipient was found with the volume-based method. CONCLUSIONS Capsule compounding with the weight-based method increases the quality of the resulting formulation. The weight-based method requires knowledge of the galenic parameters of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and excipients, but should be preferred to the volume-based method.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
963,35105611,"Community pharmacists' perception and exposure to drug promotion in Pakistan: a cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE Drug promotion is a factor that promotes the irrational use of drugs and sometimes negatively influences the prescribing/dispensing pattern. So there was a need to assess the views about accepting gifts and attitudes/influence towards drug promotion among community pharmacists in Punjab, Pakistan. SETTING Adopting a preused questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional multiple-site survey study. We distributed questionnaires to pharmacists in the community pharmacies to investigate the exposure, scepticism and acceptance to drug promotion as well as their perception about the appropriateness of gifts and to check if they had been taught about dealing with medical representatives. Data were analysed in simple percentages, and the χ2 test was used to evaluate association with demographics. All the analysis was done using SPSS V.23.0. RESULTS A total 86.9% (463/533) pharmacists completed the survey. One out of four pharmacists reported being taught about the ethics of drug promotion (26.8%) and about how to interpret drug promotional material (25.0%) and were significantly associated with higher age (age 31%-35 years, 81.9%; p<0.05). More than two-thirds of the respondents found it appropriate to accept stationery (73.4%) and textbooks (70.6%) as gifts, and only 17.5% felt it was appropriate to accept direct money. Less than half of the pharmacists (47.3%) perceived drug companies were useful for gaining knowledge about new drugs. Majority (76.2%) thought these drug promotions play a role in the irrational prescribing of antibiotics and 18.6% dispensed antibiotics due to these promotions. CONCLUSION The majority of pharmacists participating in this study felt it was appropriate to receive small value gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Only a small proportion of the respondents was given ethical training and education about drug promotion.

Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are generally deemed safe to be used during pregnancy and lactation. However, some products can be harmful to the mother, fetus or breast-fed child, which presents a challenge to health professionals and consumers. This study was aimed at assessing the practice of OTC medication dispensing and counseling services provided to pregnant and lactating by community pharmacists (CPs). A cross-sectional descriptive questionnaire-based survey was answered during February-November 2020, by licensed CPs practicing in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The determination of the significant factors associated with the CPs' views and OTC medication dispensing during pregnancy and breastfeeding was carried out using logistic regression. Among 256 respondents, dispensing medicines and referral to a physician were the predominant services provided to pregnant and lactating women. Respondents dispensed medications mostly to treat headache (74.2%), fever (62.5%) in pregnant women, and headache (81.3%) and fever (65.2%) in lactating mothers. Referral to a physician was common in pregnant women in the following cases: varicose veins (72.7%), swelling of the feet and legs (71.9%), and vaginal itching (53.9%). In breastfeeding women, the referrals were commonly for varicose veins (79.7%), swelling of the feet and legs (73.0%) and mastitis (70.3%). Most participants came to an agreement that CPs are capable of counselling and providing pregnant and lactating women the best OTC treatment. Around 35% of the respondents stated that OTC medicines are not safe to be used during pregnancy. One in five respondents stated that OTC medicines are not safe for breastfeeding women.

967,35109916,"Implementing an electronic health record dashboard for safe anticoagulant management: learning from qualitative interviews with existing and potential users to develop an implementation process. BACKGROUND Facilitating appropriate care delivery using electronic health record (digital health) tools is increasing. However, frequently used determinants frameworks seldom address key barriers for technology-associated implementation. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two contexts: the national Veterans Health Affairs (VA) following implementation of an electronic dashboard, a population health tool, and the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI2) prior to implementation of a similar electronic dashboard. The dashboard is designed for pharmacist or nurse use to monitor safe outpatient anticoagulant prescribing by physicians and other clinicians We performed rapid qualitative inquiry analysis and selected implementation strategies. Through a stakeholder focus group session, we selected implementation strategies to address determinants and facilitate implementation in the MAQI2 sites. RESULTS Among 45 interviewees (32 in VA, 13 in MAQI2), we identified five key determinants of implementation success: (1) clinician authority and autonomy, (2) clinician self-identity and job satisfaction, (3) documentation and administrative needs, (4) staffing and work schedule, and (5) integration with existing information systems. Key differences between the two contexts included concerns about information technology support and prioritization within MAQI2 (prior to implementation) but not VA (after implementation) and concerns about authority and autonomy that differed between the VA (higher baseline levels, more concerns) and MAQI2 (lower baseline levels, less concern). CONCLUSIONS The successful implementation of electronic health record tools requires unique considerations that differ from other types of implementation, must account for the status of implementation, and should address the effects of the tool deployment on clinical staff authority and autonomy. Interviewing both post-implementation and pre-implementation users can provide a robust understanding of implementation determinants.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, in my work as a hospital pharmacist, I have had opportunities to respond to informal inquiries about AD measures from hospital staff. In both cases, I think it was very important to first make people aware of the existence of SPs.The current problem is that it is sometimes difficult for the federation's staff to respond promptly, which puts a burden on their normal work. Therefore, it is important to have pharmacists who are close to the athletes and can provide health consultations on a daily basis in order to share correct information, educate them about AD measures, and help manage their health.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, learning about prohibited substances and highly technical doping rules is often difficult for athletes. Therefore, having athletes passively attending lectures is not enough to prevent unintentional doping violations caused by medicines and supplements. Therefore, it is important for athletes to acquire knowledge about individual prohibited substances as well as active learning and practical knowledge about AD measures. ""Doping Guardian"" is an educational card game that has been developed to help prevent unintentional doping violations.

In this study, we conducted a survey and interviews of young athletes to clarify the actual conditions of medication use and nutritional management (supplement use, etc.) with the aim of enhancing their health support. In addition, a second questionnaire was conducted for pharmacists working at medical institutions to clarify the actual situation of anti-doping (AD) activities by pharmacists, and examined the issues they face to support the health of athletes in the future. The results of the athletes' surveys revealed that the roles of pharmacists in AD activities was not recognized by athletes. In particular, the dissemination of AD education by pharmacists is considered to be critical. In future AD education, it will be necessary not only to provide knowledge of prohibited drugs, but also to provide self-medication support tailored to the individual needs of athletes, such as knowledge of nutrition and health. The results of the pharmacist survey revealed that athletes are treated by pharmacists on a daily basis, but for pharmacists, there are difficulties regarding how to provide information on AD, and it is necessary to enhance AD education at schools of pharmacy as well as in lifelong education seminars. Considering the pharmacists' AD activities as part of health support for athletes, it is considered more effective to collaborate with other health professionals such as sports doctors or nutritionists because it requires a wide range of knowledge such as nutrition.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
972,35110454,"[Comparison in the Recognition about Medication Education between People with Prelingual Hearing Loss and Pharmacists].  Providing medication information according to a patient's health literacy and communication ability is needed for safe and effective healthcare. Communication barriers due to hearing loss prevent pharmacists from providing medication information to patients with hearing loss. A questionnaire about the difficulty in understanding medication information and the feeling of inconvenience during medication education was conducted from September to October 2020 with 84 people with prelingual hearing loss and 346 pharmacists. The 84 hearing loss participants were divided into low- and high-scoring groups based on their understanding of medication use. Pharmacists did not realize that low-scoring group participants did not understand items with homonyms, abstract expressions about medication use and medical terminology. Pharmacists were also unaware that the low-scoring group felt the inconvenience in medication education because of the difficulty to communicate, inform not understanding medication information and consult about medication use with a pharmacist. Prior learning about hearing loss led to higher responses in recognition of the aforementioned issues. However, even pharmacists with prior experience of learning did not fully recognize that speaking out loud is not useful for effective communication and that hearing loss patients need contact methods other than the phone. This indicates the need to learn about hearing loss to improve provision of medication information and effective communication in medication education to people with hearing loss.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have investigated the influence of more full-time equivalents (FTEs) of infectious disease (ID) pharmacists on the likelihood of a post-prescription review with feedback (PPRF) intervention. This study focused on this in community hospitals before and after the Japanese medical reimbursement system was revised to introduce antimicrobial stewardship (AS) fees. We collected data for two periods: before (April 2017 to March 2018) and after (April 2018 to March 2019) AS fee implementation. The efficacy of the PPRF by the ID pharmacist was assessed based on the usage of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in days of therapy (DOT) per 100 patient-days. Further, we generated the susceptibility rate for antimicrobial-resistant organisms. The number of PPRF drugs was 2336 (2596 cases) before AS fee implementation and 2136 (1912 cases) after implementation. The overall monthly FTE for AS for an ID pharmacist increased from [median (interquartile range; IQR)] 0.34 (0.33-0.36) to 0.63 (0.61-0.63) after AS fee implementation. The DOT of the broad-spectrum antibiotics decreased from 10.46 (9.61-12.48) to 8.68 (8.14-9.18). The DOT of carbapenems and quinolones decreased significantly from 4.11 (3.69-4.41) to 3.07 (2.79-3.22) and 0.96 (0.61-1.14) to 0.37 (0.19-0.46), respectively (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of levofloxacin (LVFX)-susceptible Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa improved from 71.5 to 84.8% (p < 0.01). We observed that increasing the FTE of ID pharmacists influences the DOTs of broad-spectrum antibiotics; a higher FTE contributes to fewer DOTs.

974,35111550,"Long-term clinical effects of an inhaler guidance DVD in patients with bronchial asthma. Objectives Erroneous use of inhalers is a serious problem. Given the multitude of devices currently available, it can be difficult to convey the correct methods for their efficient use to patients. We previously generated an educational DVD that visually and audibly explains the proper use of all inhaler types available in Japan to provide inhalation guidance to patients. Herein, we report the 1-year follow-up of patients who received or did not receive the DVD guidance. Methods Sixty-nine bronchial asthma patients undergoing outpatient treatment who received inhalation guidance from a pharmacist using a standard package insert were randomly allocated to a DVD group (n=35) or a no-DVD group (n=34). Their current oral or inhalant drug regimens were unchanged. Various parameters were measured 12 months later. Frequencies of aggravation during the 12-month period were also determined. Results Compared with the no-DVD group, there were significant improvements in asthma control test scores, forced vital capacity, FEV1, impulse oscillometry, resonant frequency, induced sputum eosinophil count, and FeNO in the DVD group after 12 months. Pulmonary function and inflammation parameters improved significantly with the use of the instructive DVD in addition to the package inserts. The frequency of asthma aggravation significantly decreased in the DVD group during the 12-month study period, likely because inhalation procedures were performed accurately. Conclusions A DVD that provides accurate inhalation guidance enhances the quality of life of asthma patients and has substantial clinical ramifications. Thus, this tool would be beneficial for patients in Japan and worldwide.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effects of community pharmacist-led interventions to optimise the use of antibiotics and identify which interventions are most effective. METHODS This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42020188552). PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for (randomised) controlled trials. Included interventions were required to target antibiotic use, be set in the community pharmacy context, and be pharmacist-led. Primary outcomes were quality of antibiotic supply and adverse effects while secondary outcomes included patient reported outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the 'Cochrane suggested risk of bias criteria' and narrative synthesis of primary outcomes conducted. RESULTS Seventeen studies were included covering in total 3,822 patients (mean age 45.6 years, 61.9% female). Most studies used educational interventions. Three studies reported on primary outcomes, twelve on secondary outcomes and two on both. Three studies reported improvements in quality of dispensing, interventions led to more intensive symptom assessment (up to 30% more advice given) and a reduction of over-the-counter supply up to 53%. Three studies led to higher consumer satisfaction, effects on adherence from nine studies were mixed (risk difference 0.04 [-0.02,0.10]). All studies had unclear or high risks of bias across at least one domain, with large heterogeneity between studies.

Though antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes are the cornerstone of Uganda's national action plan (NAP) on antimicrobial resistance, there is limited evidence on AMS attitude and practices among healthcare providers in health facilities in Uganda. We determined healthcare providers' AMS attitudes, practices, and associated factors in selected health facilities in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study among nurses, clinical officers, pharmacy technicians, medical officers, pharmacists, and medical specialists in 32 selected health facilities in Uganda. Data were collected once from each healthcare provider in the period from October 2019 to February 2020. Data were collected using an interview-administered questionnaire. AMS attitude and practice were analysed using descriptive statistics, where scores of AMS attitude and practices for healthcare providers were classified into high, fair, and low using a modified Blooms categorisation. Associations of AMS attitude and practice scores were determined using ordinal logistic regression. This study reported estimates of AMS attitude and practices, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported. We adjusted for clustering at the health facility level using clustered robust standard errors. A total of 582 healthcare providers in 32 healthcare facilities were recruited into the study. More than half of the respondents (58%,340/582) had a high AMS attitude. Being a female (aOR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.92, P < 0.016), having a bachelor's degree (aOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.24-2.63, P < 0.002) or master's (aOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.13-3.75, P < 0.018) were significant predictors of high AMS attitude.

BACKGROUND Morbidity and mortality related to acute poisoning is a major public health issue in both developing and developed countries. Community pharmacists have a crucial role in ensuring drug availability, increasing drug safety, counseling patients, overdose risk reduction and management, and provision of appropriate drug information. This study aimed to assess the availability of necessary antidotes in community pharmacies in Gondar and Bahir-Dar cities, Ethiopia, and the role of community pharmacists in the management of acute poisoning. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gondar and Bahir-Dar cities. A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used for data collection and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 was used for data analysis. Chi-square analysis was computed to identify the associated factors with a confidence interval of 95% and a P value less than .05 was used as a cut-point for statistical significance. RESULTS Out of 101 community pharmacies invited to participate in the study, 80 of them completed the survey with a response rate of 79.2%. The overall mean antidote availability score was .59 (SD = .837), which falls within the definition of Poor availability. None of the pharmacies had kept all of the antidotes, and the maximum number of an antidote kept by a single pharmacy was 7 out of nineteen essential antidotes surveyed. The most commonly reported reason for the unavailability of essential antidotes was stock was not ordered (56.3%) followed by stock ordered but not delivered from suppliers (wholesalers) (20.0%). More than 3 fourth of the respondents (83.8%) had poor knowledge about the antidotes for the common poisonings. CONCLUSION There was a significantly very low availability of essential antidotes in the community pharmacies. Strategies should be implemented to improve pharmacist's knowledge about antidotes, and management of poisoning emergencies through on-job training and provision of reference materials.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
979,35115261,"Patient perspectives of discussing social determinants of health with community pharmacists. BACKGROUND Social determinants of health (SDOH) have a considerable impact on the lives and health outcomes of Black communities. Although the implementation of social needs screening in various clinical settings has been studied, the patient perspective of discussing SDOH with health care providers has not been thoroughly investigated. There is an opportunity for community pharmacists to help identify social risk factors and address social needs, particularly in minoritized communities. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this project were to (1) characterize the perspectives of Black patients regarding social risk discussions with community pharmacists and (2) to develop a framework for community pharmacists to engage in conversations with patients about social risk factors. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted using principles of grounded theory. Patient perspectives regarding discussions of 5 key determinants of health (economic stability, education, social and community context, health and health care, and neighborhood and built environment) were elicited through semistructured interviews. Data analysis included interpretation of interview transcripts from 14 Black adults living in medically underserved areas in Memphis, TN. Charmaz's approach to theory development was followed. RESULTS Three themes emerged to characterize the needs and expectations for patients in discussing social risk factors with community pharmacists. The themes of rationale, relationship, and resources were compiled to construct the newly developed Social Determinants of Health Patient Communication Framework. This framework describes the key factors that affected the patient receptiveness and willingness to discuss their social needs. CONCLUSION Although patients are open to sharing social issues with community pharmacists, they may be reluctant to discuss social factors if initial understanding, personal connection, or resources are not present. This proposed, novel framework is a step toward improving the assessment of SDOH for underserved Black patients within community pharmacies. This framework can also be used for future education of pharmacists and other health care providers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
980,35115349,"Factors associated with recruitment success in the phase 2a study of aztreonam-avibactam development programme: a descriptive qualitative analysis among sites in Spain. OBJECTIVE Successful clinical trials are subject to recruitment. Recently, the REJUVENATE trial, a prospective phase 2a open-label, single-arm interventional clinical trial conducted within the Innovative Medicines Initiative-supported Combatting Bacterial Resistance in Europe-Carbapenem Resistance project, was published, with 85% of the recruitment performed in Spain. We analysed the recruitment success in this trial by establishing a model of recruitment practice. METHODS A descriptive qualitative study was performed from May 2016 to October 2017 at 10 participating Spanish centres. Data were extracted from: (1) feasibility questionnaires to assess the centre's potential for patient enrolment; (2) delegation of responsibility records; (3) pre-screening records including an anonymised list of potentially eligible and (4) screening and enrolment records. A descriptive analysis of the features was performed by the participating centre. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to determine factors of recruitment success. RESULTS The highest recruitment rate was observed in Hospitals 3 and 6 (58.8 and 47.0 patients per month, respectively). All the study teams were multidisciplinary with a median of 15 members (range: 7-22). Only Hospitals 3, 5 and 6 had dedicated nursing staff appointed exclusively to this study. Moreover, in those three hospitals and in Hospital 9, the study coordinator performed exclusive functions as a research planner, and did not assume these functions for the other hospitals. The univariate analysis showed a significant association between recruitment success and months of recruitment (p=0.024), number of staff (p<0.001), higher number of pharmacists (p=0.005), infectious disease specialists (p<0.001), the presence of microbiologist in the research team (p=0.018) and specifically dedicated nursing staff (p=0.036).

Those that were published in English, discussed at least 1 method directed at improving an SM task, and were within the first 25 nonadvertisement results for each search were included. Resources directed specifically at adolescents were excluded. Understandability and actionability of the online resources were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Quality of the online resources was evaluated using the DISCERN instrument. The number of SM tasks each resource discussed was also evaluated. Overall mean appropriateness was calculated by averaging the percentage scores of understandability, actionability, and quality. Results Fifty-two resources were included.

982,35116207,"Evaluating the impact of an emergency department protocol that guides management of methamphetamine-induced agitation and psychosis. Background Methamphetamine is an addictive stimulant that may induce symptoms of agitation and psychosis. The estimated rate of methamphetamine use is 6.6 per 1000 people. Currently, no treatment guidelines exist to support the optimal management of patients presenting with methamphetamine-induced agitation. Emergency department (ED) providers may prescribe various benzodiazepines (BZDs) and antipsychotics (APs) as first-line agents to stabilize these agitated patients. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a protocol to guide management of this condition. Methods This was a retrospective, pre- and poststudy conducted from July 2020 to March 2021 at a large academic medical center. A multidisciplinary protocol was designed to help manage methamphetamine-induced agitation in the ED. The primary outcome of the study was a reduction in the number of BZDs and APs used for the treatment of methamphetamine-induced agitation. This was measured by the incidence of overprescribing, defined as 3 or more APs or BZDs administered within 30 minutes. Secondary outcomes included the use of physical restraints, ED length of stay, and adverse events. Results We did not observe a significantly lower incidence of overprescribing, adverse events, or ED length of stay when comparing pre- and postprotocol groups. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that when protocol was followed, there was a statistically significant reduction in overprescribing (P = .001).

We assess provider and CPS perceptions of the contributions of CPS to MH clinical teams in the Veterans Health Administration. Methods We examined the roles and functions of CPS in MH clinics through surveys (n = 374) and semistructured interviews (n = 16) with MH CPS and other members of MH clinical teams (psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers) to gain insight into how CPS were integrated in these settings. We assessed perceptions of CPS contributions to MH teams, interactions between CPS and other providers, and challenges of integrating CPS into MH clinical teams. Results Contributions of CPS in MH were received positively by clinical team members. Clinical pharmacy specialists providing comprehensive medication management were especially valuable in the management of clozapine. The knowledge and training of CPS reassured providers who frequently referred to them with questions about medication and medication therapy management.

Methods The study consisted of a presurvey and postsurvey carried out among final-year pharmacy students of the University of Nigeria Nsukka. A survey comprising 3 sections on sociodemographic details, attitudes toward PwS, and a social distance scale was given to conveniently sampled students before and after lectures on schizophrenia. Students were encouraged to watch a movie about the experiences of a PwS after the first lecture. Results One hundred seventy-nine students (of the 200 sampled, response rate 91.1%) agreed to participate and completed the survey instrument before the clinical lecture, whereas 108 students who took part in the presurvey participated in the postsurvey (response rate of 76.0%). The overall mean negative attitude score reduced from 2.79 ± 0.412 to 2.72 ± 0.357. The overall mean social distance score increased from 2.48 ± 0.415 to 2.49 ± 0.467, indicating increased stigma. In both presurveys and postsurveys, people with a friend or relative with schizophrenia had a lower mean negative attitude score compared with those who did not.

The current gold standard for treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) is levodopa/carbidopa (L/C), but long-term treatment frequently results in motor complications, such as wearing-off and motor fluctuations (eg, dyskinesia, ""on-off"" phenomenon). Istradefylline is a new drug with a unique pharmacologic profile that was approved by the FDA for use as adjunctive treatment to L/C in adult patients with PD experiencing ""off"" episodes. The drug was shown to reduce ""off"" time in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse effects are dyskinesia, dizziness, constipation, nausea, hallucinations, and insomnia. Unlike many drugs that treat PD, istradefylline is a nondopaminergic drug that exerts its effects via adenosine A2A receptor antagonism. The major drug interactions involve inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 as well as tobacco smoking via induction of CYP1A1. Istradefylline is taken once daily as a 20- or 40-mg dose, except in cases involving drug interactions or hepatic impairment. The cost of the drug is relatively expensive, which has implications for Medicare and private insurance coverage.

987,35116213,"Impact on hospital-wide antipsychotic prescribing practices through physician peer comparison letters.  Peer comparison is a behavioral strategy that provides feedback to individuals on how they compare with others. It is used to improve health care quality, reduce inappropriate prescribing, and improve physician performance. There is very little data on peer comparison and the impact on system-wide prescribing practices, particularly with antipsychotics. To that end, the Maryland statewide pharmacy and therapeutics committee reviews hospital-level antipsychotic data for 5 facilities on a quarterly basis, including high doses and polypharmacy. One facility, Springfield Hospital Center, consistently stood out in 2016 as having higher rates of high doses of haloperidol, olanzapine, and quetiapine as well as patients receiving 3 or more antipsychotics. The pharmacist began to send out individual letters to the psychiatrists detailing their prescribing habits in these areas compared with other psychiatrists and the other state facilities. Over the course of 4 years, the percentage of patients on high doses of 3 antipsychotics substantially decreased. The percentage of patients on polypharmacy in the facility decreased, but not at the same rate as the other hospitals, leaving the facility even higher than the state average at the end of the 4-year period. Pharmacist-initiated physician peer comparison letters were associated with a considerable decrease in the prevalence of high-dose olanzapine, haloperidol, and quetiapine but did not appear to impact antipsychotic polypharmacy. This type of communication may be beneficial for stimulating system-wide changes in prescribing practices for high doses of antipsychotics; however, more individualized interventions are likely needed to reduce antipsychotic polypharmacy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The average clinic visits were 2.4 times of the study participants. Two thirds patients (117/173) had one or more identified DRPs in medication therapy review. Adverse drug reaction, potential drug interaction and non-adherence were the leading DRPs. 85.8% of DRPs could be resolved (cured or improved) in four weeks. Tumor patients showed medication adherence reached 84-100% after three or four times of follow-up and intervention. Conclusions The participation of clinical pharmacists in managing polypharmacy tumor patients, with the independent anti-neoplastic MTM system, facilitated the identifying and solving DRPs, especially improving medication adherence of patients, and thus enhancing the effectiveness, safety and rational use of medication.",0,0,1,1,0,Unclear what was compared.,,,,,,,,,
990,35117984,"Teamwork in Health Care Services Delivery in Nigeria: A Mixed Methods Assessment of Perceptions and Lived Experiences of Pharmacists in a Tertiary Hospital. Background Lack of teamwork is the bane of weak and ineffective health care systems in many countries. This study examined the perceptions and lived experiences of pharmacists working in a Nigerian government-owned (public) multispecialty tertiary hospital regarding teamwork in their workplace. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed methods study using phenomenological approach of inquiry, was conducted among pharmacists with experience in multidisciplinary health care provision in a public tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Questionnaires with 16 close-ended questions based on a Likert scale, which scored from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), were administered. The mean (M) scores were determined using SPSS Version 20; M ≥ 3.00 indicated agree, while M < 3.00 disagree. Subsequently, focus group discussions were conducted, and the audio recorded responses transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis using NVivo 11. Results Some participants (50%) had worked for 5-10 years in the hospital's Department of Pharmacy, 25% (11-20 years), and 16.7% (21-30 years). Participants agreed that effective teamwork leads to positive patient outcomes (M = 3.67) and is in the public's interest (M = 4.25). However, they disagreed that their workplace supports teamwork (M = 2.33), effective interprofessional collaborative practices exist in the hospital (M = 1.08), and their remuneration reflects their worth to the organization (M = 2.33). Doctors' dominance and claim of ownership of patients, allied professionals' attitudes and ignorance of pharmacists' roles, salary disparity, poor communication, and defective leadership style among others were identified as impediments to teamwork. Conclusion The hospital pharmacists demonstrated positive disposition towards teamwork, and agreed that effective teamwork would improve health care delivery. However, they identified some factors that hinder interprofessional teamwork in the hospital. Principles and practices of teamwork should be incorporated into the curriculum of each discipline; interdisciplinary collaborative practices, health system structure, institutional policies and leadership should be strengthened to enhance teamwork.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
991,35118756,"Are x-waiver trainings enough? Facilitators and barriers to buprenorphine prescribing after x-waiver trainings. BACKGROUND In the United States, an x-waiver credential is necessary to prescribe buprenorphine medication treatment for opioid use disorder (B-MOUD). Historically, this process has required certified training, which could be a barrier to obtaining an x-waiver and subsequently prescribing. To address this barrier, the US recently removed the training requirement for some clinicians. We sought to determine if clinicians who attended x-waiver training went on to obtain an x-waiver and prescribe B-MOUD, and to examine what facilitated or impeded B-MOUD prescribing. METHODS In September 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, electronic survey of attendees of 15 in-person x-waiver pieces of training from June 2018 to January 2020 within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Of the attendees (n = 321), we surveyed current VHA clinicians who recalled taking the training. The survey assessed whether clinicians obtained the x-waiver, had prescribed B-MOUD, and barriers or facilitators that influenced B-MOUD prescribing. RESULTS Of 251 eligible participants, 62 (24.7%) responded to the survey, including 27 (43.5%) physicians, 16 (25.8%) advanced practice clinicians, and 12 (19.4%) pharmacists. Of the 43 clinicians who could prescribe, 29 (67.4%) had obtained their x-waiver and 16 (37.2%) had reported prescribing B-MOUD. Prominent barriers to prescribing B-MOUD included a lack of supporting clinical staff and competing demands on time. The primary facilitator to prescribing was leadership support. CONCLUSIONS Nine months after x-waiver training, two-thirds of clinicians with prescribing credentials had obtained their x-waiver and one-third were prescribing B-MOUD. Removing the x-waiver training may not have the intended policy effect as other barriers to B-MOUD prescribing persist.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
992,35120174,"Acceptability and feasibility of the NPS MedicineWise mobile phone application in supporting medication adherence in patients with chronic heart failure: Protocol for a pilot study. INTRODUCTION Heart failure (HF) is an increasing global concern. Despite evidence-based pharmacotherapy, morbidity and mortality remain high in HF. Medication non-adherence is a crucial factor in optimising clinical outcomes. A growing number of smartphone applications (apps) assist management. While evidence support their use to promote treatment adherence, apps alone may not be the solution. The objective of this pilot study is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a tiered intervention added to the NPS MedicineWise dose reminder app (MedicineWise app) in supporting medication adherence in HF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This prospective, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial will recruit 55 Australian patients with HF to be randomly assigned to either intervention (MedicineWise app + usual care) or control (usual care alone) arm. Control participants will remain unaware of the intervention throughout the study. At baseline, intervention participants will be instructed in the MedicineWise app. A reminder will then prompt medication administration at each dosing interval. If non-adherence is suggested from 24 hourly reports (critical medications) or 72 hours (non-critical medications), the individual/s will be escalated through a tiered, pharmacist-led intervention. The primary outcome will be the acceptability and feasibility of this approach in supporting adherence. Between-group comparison of the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS) at baseline, 3 and 6 months will be used to measure the app's value in supporting adherence. Secondary outcome measures include self-reported medication adherence and knowledge, health-related quality of life, psychological wellbeing, signs and symptoms of HF, and medication and HF knowledge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The protocol received ethics approval from Central Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number R20190302) and University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number 202450).

994,35120863,"Expanded roles of community pharmacists in COVID-19: A scoping literature review. BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the world health care system adversely, but it has also brought out innovative roles for health care professionals to cater to growing health care needs. Community pharmacists provide community pharmacy services and can play a vital role in fighting the pandemic by taking on novel roles that complement their pre-existing roles. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to provide a scoping review of current and emerging literature about the novel roles adopted by community pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Online databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed were searched systematically using the keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""pharmacist,"" and ""community."" Articles were selected based on availability of full text in English language, with time limit from December 1, 2019, to October 31, 2021; case reports, cross-sectional studies, literature reviews, qualitative studies, and systematic reviews were included, whereas commentary reviews and editorials were excluded from the search methodology. An independent review of the articles was conducted for inclusion based on relatability to study subject; those chosen were screened for references to find additional gray literature. Findings were arranged in themes, and the results were organized accordingly. RESULTS Novel roles for community pharmacists were found in relation to maintenance of drug-supply chains, delivery of telepharmacy and telehealth services, provision of ambulatory pharmacy services, use of digital software to coordinate medication delivery for patients with chronic conditions, dispelling of misinformation, and roles in research and clinical trials. Roles in a post-COVID world regarding immunization of population and involvement in lifting lockdown strictures alongside other stakeholders were also explored. CONCLUSION Although COVID-19 has challenged the health care system, it has also provided an opportunity for development of novel and innovative roles that can ultimately have profound consequences for the health care system. Community pharmacists, despite facing multiple challenges in the community, should be facilitated to adapt with these new roles, which can be beneficial in achieving mass immunization and better health care in a post-COVID world.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
995,35120864,"A successful intervention to improve medication adherence in black patients with hypertension: Mediation analysis of 28-site TEAM trial. BACKGROUND We previously reported the main effects and cost-effectiveness of a successful multifaceted Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention to improve refill adherence in black patients with hypertension. It is important to identify the key mediators or intervention components that contributed to this intervention effect. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to conduct a ""mediation analysis"" to determine which intervention components had the largest effect on refill adherence and assess patient satisfaction with pharmacy care. METHODS A cluster-randomized trial was conducted among 576 black patients in 28 pharmacies (14 TEAM, 14 control). TEAM participants were invited to 6 visits with a pharmacist-technician team that monitored the patient's blood pressure and used a 9-item Brief Medication Questionnaire, Brief Goal Check, and other novel tools to identify and reduce barriers to adherence in black patients. Control participants received printed information only. Refill adherence was defined as > 80% days covered (proportion of days covered) per refill records during months 7 to 12 (postintervention); potential mediators and patient satisfaction were assessed using a research questionnaire administered at month 6. A structural probit model examined 4 potential mediators that might explain intervention success. RESULTS Of 4 potential mediators, the most important factors in explaining the improvement in refill adherence (postintervention) were greater pharmacist collaboration with patient in barrier reduction (68.5% of total indirect effect) and patient use of a pillbox (27.2% of total indirect effect). Pharmacist contact with physician and suggestion of a change in regimen did not have significant effects on adherence. TEAM participants were more likely than control participants to rate their pharmacist care as ""very satisfactory"" (80.2% vs. 44.2%, P < 0.001) and technician care as ""very satisfactory"" (81.2% vs. 47.4%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Refill adherence and satisfaction can be improved in black patients with hypertension by implementing a collaborative TEAM model with novel tools that enable community pharmacists and technicians to help identify and reduce the core barriers to adherence. Our results can be used to individualize and improve patient care and adherence outcomes in this vulnerable population.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Community,
996,35121041,"Impact of Continuous Pharmacist Intervention for Injectable Antimicrobials on the Treatment of Patients with Escherichia coli Bacteremia. BACKGROUND A prospective audit with intervention and feedback (PAF) by pharmacists is important for the appropriate use of antimicrobials. Clinically, Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteremia is a common condition, but only few researchers have examined the role of PAF in its appropriate use of antimicrobials. METHODS We started PAF by pharmacists in 2017 for all injectable antibiotics. This study included cases of E. coli bacteremia that resulted in hospitalization over a 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. Patients were grouped by year (Period 0-3), and clinical outcomes were examined. RESULTS The pharmacists had 12 and 54 suggestions in Periods 0 and 3, respectively. The most common suggestion was de-escalation. The median duration of antimicrobial use was 12 (interquartile range: 8-15) days in Periods 0-2. The duration of antimicrobial use was significantly reduced to 9 (7-12) days in Period 3. In Period 3, the duration of antimicrobial use was reduced by 29%, while anti-pseudomonal drug use was reduced by 42% compared with that in period 0. The 30-day mortality rates were not significantly different between the groups.

997,35121571,"Preparing Pharmacy Educators as Expedition Guides to Support Professional Identity Formation in Pharmacy Education.  Objective. To provide an educator-friendly travel guide for supporting professional identity formation (PIF) for pharmacy students.Findings. In contrast to professionalism, which has emphasized externally visible behaviors, professional identity focuses on the internalization of the attitudes, standards, and behavioral norms of a profession, such that one ""thinks, acts, and feels"" like a member of that profession. Identity, whether personal or professional, is continuously developed in part during interactions with others and in response to internal and external feedback on those interactions. Educators play a critical role in helping students navigate the ""provocative moments"" (eg, transitions, dissonance) that accompany identity formation. To help educators travel with purpose, several identity formation theories suggest means of creating learning experiences and supporting the development of a professional identity. Additionally, guidebooks for the trip (ie, published literature) provide examples of didactic and experiential teaching approaches that can be used to promote PIF. While further exploration and research are necessary, traveling this journey with colleagues can help members of the Academy succeed in sustainably and effectively infusing intentional PIF within pharmacy education and training.Summary. There are myriad ways for educators to develop and support PIF, which can present a challenge when defining the role that educators play in this complex, dynamic process. Educators must understand the reasoning behind various approaches and the common dialogue used, in order to engage and support learners as their expedition guides on the lifelong journey to professional identity formation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective To determine the extent pharmacy faculty engaged in remote-work during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and secondarily to characterize pharmacy faculty and administrator perceptions of remote-work.Methods A 28-question online survey was sent to 6,548 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) members. Questions centered on the extent of remote-work and perceptions of its impact on productivity, effectiveness, and work-life balance. Focus groups were held to provide additional insight. Data were analyzed statistically, with a priori level of significance set at less than 0.05.Results 6,322 AACP members met inclusion criteria, of whom 1,293 responded to the survey (21% response-rate). At least one faculty and one administrator responded from 139 (99% response-rate) and 126 schools (89% response-rate), respectively. During the pandemic, 97% of faculty were permitted to work remotely, 94% of whom did so at least ""some of the time"". Most faculty indicated no change or an improvement in productivity (85%) and effectiveness (80%). Similarly, most administrators indicated no change or an increase in their unit's productivity (81%) and effectiveness (85%). More than one-half of respondents indicated better work-life balance while working remotely.Conclusion Nearly all respondents were permitted to work remotely at least ""some of the time"" during the pandemic. Considering most faculty and administrators believe productivity and effectiveness were not compromised, and that there appear to be benefits to work-life balance, US schools of pharmacy should consider permitting faculty to work remotely some of the time, as we navigate the pandemic and thereafter.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
999,35122366,"Scoping review - What do we know about Aboriginal peoples' use of Dose Administration Aids? ISSUED ADDRESSED This paper aims to report findings of a scoping review which mapped and summarised available literature regarding Aboriginal peoples' use of Dose Administration Aids (DAAs) for improved medication management. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have higher rates of chronic disease than other Australians, leading to increased numbers of prescribed medications and complex medication taking regimens. The Australian Government and Pharmacy Bodies provide programs for Aboriginal peoples with chronic conditions, including programs supporting access to DAAs to improve medication adherence. METHODS The search strings used included three key concepts: Indigeneity; DAAs and outcomes including terms such as adherence and compliance. PubMed, Medline via Ovid and the grey literature were searched. RESULTS After removal of duplicates, 462 papers were screened by title and abstract for inclusion. A further 449 papers were then excluded leaving a total of thirteen papers included in the review. Seven of these papers included all three concepts in the search criteria, none of these were empirical studies. The papers included in the study consisted of a guide to support pharmacists to provide culturally appropriate care; two opinion pieces; a systematic review of adherence; a paper that explained supports available to Aboriginal people that supports adherence to medications; an evaluation; and a submission to parliament. CONCLUSION The lack of studies found in this review, and their recommendations for further study support the requirement for empirical research regarding the effects of DAAs on medication taking behaviours of Aboriginal people. Further studies regarding the patients experience and the programs that provide them are supported. SO WHAT?: The Australian Government funds programs that provides access to DAAs as a method of improving medication taking behaviours. But what do we really know about DAAs and if or how they assist in this goal?",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine independent community pharmacist preparedness for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and to identify strategies for COVID-19 pandemic vaccination implementation in Pennsylvania. METHODS This study used a complementary mixed-methods approach to recruit independent community pharmacists to participate in an electronic survey and 2 virtually conducted focus groups before the availability of the first COVID-19 vaccine. Information was gathered and compiled into 5 topic areas: (1) workflow, (2) resources, (3) staff and patient safety, (4) communication, and (5) documentation and training. Data collection occurred between October and December 2020. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed. A directed, content analysis was conducted to identify strategies for each topic area, and supporting quotes were selected. RESULTS A total of 88 and 11 independent community pharmacists participated in the survey and focus groups, respectively. Because of the small size of most independent pharmacies, participants recommended working with community partners to support off-site mass vaccination clinics. Leveraging partnerships with community organizations and universities could be used to support staffing for vaccination efforts. Using an appointment-based immunization model was identified as one tool to optimize patient and staff safety during the pandemic. Pharmacists suggested using existing scheduling tools and text messaging and automated phone calls for second-dose reminders. Finally, independent pharmacists recommended further training and process improvements to support vaccine documentation and transmission to the Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System. CONCLUSION Recommendations from this study were used to support planning and preparation for COVID-19 vaccinations across Pennsylvania. Incorporation of pharmacists' ideas and recommendations on pandemic vaccination implementation is an important strategy to efficiently expand vaccination administration during pandemics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1002,35123903,"Implementation of Medication Reconciliation conducted by hospital pharmacists: A case study guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. BACKGROUND Medication reconciliation (MR) implementation in hospital care transitions has proved to be a challenge for health professionals and managers. It points to the need to conduct Implementation Research with a view to understanding the tasks of the real world and knowing how they impact this process. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), this study aims to analyze the factors that influenced the MR implementation process conducted by pharmacists at a hospital setting. METHODS A qualitative case study was carried out in the cardiology and gastroenterology units of a teaching hospital in Brazil, involving participant observation and semi-structured interviews with physicians, pharmacists, nurses, nutritionists and a social worker. The CFIR was used to guide data collection and thematic analysis. The constructs were classified according to their influence and strength. RESULTS Sixteen health professionals involved directly or indirectly with MR implementation participated in the study. Based on the analysis of the participants' quotes and of the field diary, 18 constructs of the CFIR were identified as influencing MR implementation. The constructs that most strongly influenced MR implementation concerned ""Inner Setting"", ""Characteristics of Individuals"" and ""Characteristics of Intervention"". The participating professionals showed little knowledge of MR and had different points of view on its scope, weakly relating MR to patient safety. The tools used to conduct MR were adapted according to the hospital's needs, thus facilitating its implementation. However, MR proved to be complex and require clinical knowledge and aligned teamwork to identify and resolve undocumented medication discrepancies, being as well intertwined with culture and organizational communication. CONCLUSIONS The results point to implementation failures and highlight that MR is a complex intervention, requiring specific knowledge from the multidisciplinary team and alignment with other existing workflows. The barriers and facilitators identified may serve to design and test implementation improvement strategies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1003,35123980,"""I just was really scared, because it's already such an uncertain time"": Exploring women's abortion experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. OBJECTIVE Travel restrictions, physical distancing and quarantine requirements, lockdowns, and stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19 have impacted abortion services across Canada. We aimed to explore the decision-making and care experiences of those who obtained abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic and understand recent abortion patients' perspectives on demedicalized models of medication abortion service delivery. STUDY DESIGN We conducted 23 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women across Canada who obtained abortion care after March 15, 2020. We audio-recorded and transcribed the telephone/Skype/Zoom interviews and managed our data with ATLAS.ti. We analyzed the English-language interviews for content and themes using inductive and deductive techniques. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated economic and social support uncertainties, factored into many of our participants' decisions to obtain an abortion. Participants expressed relief at and gratitude for being able to secure abortion care during the pandemic. Although women in our study reflected positively on their abortion care experiences, many felt that service delivery changes initiated because of the public heath emergency exacerbated pre-COVID-19 barriers to care and contributed to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our participants expressed considerable enthusiasm for demedicalized models of medication abortion care, including telemedicine services and behind-the-counter availability of mifepristone/misoprostol. CONCLUSIONS For our participants, abortion care constituted an essential health service. Our findings demonstrate the importance of continuing to provide access to safe, effective, and timely abortion care during public health emergencies. Exploring additional models of demedicalized medication abortion service delivery to address persistent access barriers in Canada is warranted. IMPLICATIONS Policymakers and clinicians should consider patient experiences as well as clinical evidence when considering regulatory changes to facilitate access to abortion care during public health emergencies. Identifying a multitude of ways to offer a full range of abortion services, including demedicalized models of medication abortion care, has the potential to meet significant needs in the COVID-19 era and beyond. The COVID pandemic highlights the need for demedicalized models, not only for the sake of those seeking abortion care but also to ease the burden on medical professionals during public health emergencies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Computerised prescriptions for Hospital Discharge Orders (HDO) are used world-wide to secure medication processes. OBJECTIVES To evaluate physicians' adoption of computerised provider order-entry (CPOE) for HDO and the prescribing error rate of HDO in an acute medical care unit. SETTING A prospective study was conducted in an internal medicine department over a six-month period. The use rate of CPOE for HDO edition, prescription lines concordance between CPOE-edited HDO, exit prescriptions transcribed in the discharge summary (DS), and prescribing error rate in CPOE-edited HDO were all evaluated. RESULTS A total of 407 patients with HDO were included in the study. HDO were edited via CPOE system for 350 patients (86%), among which 124 (35%) were identically transcribed, 217 (62%) had discrepancies, and nine (3%) were not transcribed in the discharge summary (DS). Prescription errors were analysed using the total of 2,854 drugs prescribed on HDO. Although hospital pharmacists had signalled discrepancies and provided recommendations to the prescribers via alerting pharmaceutical interventions in CPOE 67 prescription errors (error rate of 2.3%) were found. Errors included 53 cases of refractory period disrespected, four cases of drug interactions, three cases of drug redundancies, and two cases of excessive dosage. CONCLUSION This study highlights that most HDO were edited via the CPOE system. Together with pharmacist's interventions, the CPOE system contributed to reducing the prescription error rate in HDO. However, discrepancies in the recording process to DS were frequent, calling for reinforcement of error prevention strategies upon the integration of a CPOE system in the hospital's Electronic Health Records.

1005,35124762,"The protected antimicrobial process in a University Teaching Hospital: a qualitative interview study exploring the knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of healthcare professionals.  Background The protected or restricted supply of certain antimicrobials such as linezolid, caspofungin, aztreonam, in the acute hospital setting is an important element of Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) programmes to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. This process involves submitting an application for use to be reviewed typically by a Consultant Microbiologist, Infectious Disease Consultant or Antimicrobial Pharmacist. Aim To investigate healthcare professionals' knowledge, experiences, and attitudes towards the protected/restricted antimicrobials process in order to identify possible methods of optimisation and improvement. Method Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in the protected/restricted antimicrobial prescribing, dispensing and administration process were conducted in September-October 2019 in a 350-bed voluntary, general, acute hospital in Ireland. Interviews were analysed by the Framework method and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Results Interviews were conducted with 8 Doctors, 4 Pharmacists and 3 Nurses. TDF domains identified included: 'Knowledge'; 'Social/professional role and identity'; 'Social influences'; 'Memory, attention and decision processes'; 'Beliefs about consequences'; 'Environmental contexts and resources'. The relationship between prescribers and the AMS Team was reported as a facilitator of the process, whereas the inconsistency of the filing and versions of forms on the wards were seen as challenges. Conclusion The results of this study have shown that the existing protected/restricted antimicrobial process is a multi-disciplinary effort with barriers that require attention in order to make future improvements.

1006,35125189,"Use of journal clubs and book clubs in pharmacy education: A scoping review. BACKGROUND Journal clubs and book clubs are educational activities used in health sciences education to teach evidence-based decision-making, critical thinking, and appraisal skills, and build trainee understanding about important professional issues. The main objective of this scoping review was to identify and synthesize all research studies on journal or book clubs for pharmacy learners. A secondary objective was to identify gaps in the literature where future research would be beneficial to pharmacy educators and learners. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was run across five databases. Studies were screened using a two stage, blinded, independent screening process. RESULTS Forty-two studies met all inclusion criteria; 86% reported on journal clubs and 14% on book clubs. Of the journal club studies, 50% were in didactic courses, 33% in experiential education, and 17% were co-curricular initiatives. Of the six book club studies, 67% were within didactic courses and 33% were co-curricular initiatives, including the only interprofessional education study. Most journal clubs were used to teach evidence-based practice, drug literature evaluation, or biostatistics. Book clubs were more focused on soft skills or topics students were less likely to encounter in the core curriculum. IMPLICATIONS Future research on journal clubs and book clubs in pharmacy education should continue to assess student learning outcomes and abilities. Specifically, future studies should move beyond evaluating student perceptions of journal clubs to investigate effectiveness for topics other than drug literature evaluation or evidence-based practice, and the impact of journal clubs and book clubs on interprofessional knowledge, communication, and team dynamics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1007,35125190,"Learner attitudes towards a virtual microbiology simulation for pharmacy student education. INTRODUCTION Simulation for education has become popular, but much literature on this modality fails to critically examine the learner's experience, focusing instead on learning outcomes. Learner attitudes should be scrutinised and monitored to appraise a technology-enhanced learning experience as student perceived educational benefits of technology-enhanced learning is reported to be more important than the intrinsic characteristics of any particular medium or tool. This study sought to evaluate pharmacy students' attitudes toward a virtual microbiology simulation. METHODS The virtual microbiology simulation (VUMIE) was compared with a traditional wet laboratory (lab) in a second-year integrated pharmacotherapeutics course for bachelor of pharmacy students. Data were collected using surveys deployed at baseline (pre-intervention), post-intervention (VUMIE or wet lab), and endpoint (post-interventions). Statistical and qualitative thematic analyses were performed. RESULTS Learners found the simulation valuable, and outcomes suggest that it is possible for technology-enhanced learning activities to replace face-to-face instruction to some extent, which may be useful given the current challenges with in-person education resulting from COVID-19. More students reported a specific preference for the wet lab rather than VUMIE. CONCLUSIONS: Although technology-enhanced simulation can produce a similar learning experience to a traditional wet lab, this evidence is not sufficient to completely replace the traditional lab experience for clinical courses of study. Technology-enhanced simulation could be considered for just-in-time training before exposure to traditional lab activities, for specific skill acquisition using deliberate practice, and perhaps for standardised assessment for clinical microbiology education.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Stigmatizing attitudes of pharmacists can contribute to poor outcomes in individuals with mental illness. Direct contact with patients during pharmacy experiential education helps establish positive attitudes toward people with mental illness yet may not be available to all students. The use of film in pharmacy education has the potential to facilitate learning and improve attitudes. METHODS We evaluated students' perceptions regarding the impact of an elective course for pharmacy students which incorporated feature films about mental illnesses. Students completed surveys addressing their perceptions of each film's role in facilitation of learning, attitudes about mental illness, and comfort level for interacting with patients with mental illness. RESULTS A total of 125 students completed a course featuring 17 films over the four-year study period. The films with the highest weighted positive rankings were Temple Grandin, Helen, As Good As It Gets, Born on the Fourth of July, Iris, A Beautiful Mind, and Silver Linings Playbook. Less favored films included One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Prozac Nation, and My Own Private Idaho. CONCLUSIONS Direct contact with patients may best prepare future pharmacists to serve the needs of people with mental illness. This study suggests that students perceive feature films used in an elective course may have a positive impact on facilitating learning and improving attitudes of pharmacy students toward individuals with mental illness.

1009,35125194,"Exploring the relationship between stress and student leadership among student pharmacists. INTRODUCTION Previous studies show student pharmacists have a lower health-related quality of life than undergraduate students and are among the most stressed of the health profession students. The long-term effects of chronic stress on healthcare providers can lead to reduced productivity, increased turnover, and medical errors. The goal of this research was to gather information from students who participate in organizational leadership positions regarding their opinions of the benefits of the leadership positions and feelings about stress, burnout, and quality of life. METHODS Student pharmacists holding leadership positions were asked to complete an electronic survey. Survey questions were based on behavioral assessment instruments. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data and yes/no question responses. The Spearman Rho test was used to look for associations when comparing variables. RESULTS Sixty-four students completed the survey. There was a significant association between both self-reported lower quality of sleep and reduced time dedicated to leisure activities with holding concurrent positions (p = 0.021, p = 0.028, respectively). No significant relationship was found between the number of leadership positions held concurrently, satisfaction gained from those positions, professional year in pharmacy school, employment during didactic years, or self-perceived test taking performance. Student pharmacists reported taking on leadership positions in student organizations for a variety of reasons, including desire to improve skills, make connections, improve the profession, and gain experience. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy faculty mentors may be able to utilize the results of this study to encourage student leaders and better understand the challenges that come with organization leadership positions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1010,35125195,"The pharmacist as entrepreneur: Whether, how, and when to educate? INTRODUCTION Policy and funding changes are transforming how community pharmacists deliver services, with a level of entrepreneurship required to fulfil their dual roles as retailers and health care professionals. This study explored pharmacists' own entrepreneurship skill development, their views on the need for entrepreneurship training, and how and when this should be delivered. METHODS Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 New Zealand practising community pharmacists and key pharmacy sector stakeholders known for having an entrepreneurial mindset. RESULTS Thematic analysis revealed five broad themes in relation to the study aim. Pharmacists had gained skills in entrepreneurship via training and education in a range of settings, including 'on the job'. While views were divided regarding the feasibility of training individuals to be entrepreneurs, most felt that some form of training was required to address shortfalls in the current workforce. There was support for this being delivered as part of the undergraduate pharmacy degree, although some felt that clinical learning should remain the core focus at this level. There were also mixed views regarding the timing of education in entrepreneurship. CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the literature addressing the pharmacists view of when and by whom education in entrepreneurship should be delivered. The divergence of opinion has implications for educational leaders, policymakers and practitioners. Findings highlight the important role of education and training in developing pharmacists with entrepreneurship skills. However, the format of this in terms of delivery, timing, appropriate training providers, and training content, needs to be better understood.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1011,35125196,"The impact of pharmacy candidates' understanding of psychiatry on personal mental health concerns and patient treatment. INTRODUCTION Psychiatry modules in pharmacy education have the potential to address mental health stigma and may help future pharmacists discuss mental health concerns by altering willingness to engage persons with mental illness to better help this patient population. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of a psychiatry module on pharmacy candidates' own utilization of mental health resources for themselves, as patients, and the ability to address mental illness during patient interactions. METHODS Forty-six participants completed a 22-item, anonymous questionnaire. Pre- and posttest data were collected to assess perceived impact on patient treatment and self-reflection from their own mental health and treatment. The survey also assessed doctor of pharmacy candidates' changes in comfort level of treating patients with mental illness, referring family or friends for mental health counseling, and personal willingness to obtain counseling with regards to mental health. RESULTS There were significant differences in pre- and posttest mean scores in participants' comfort level counseling patients with mental illness, comfort level in discussing mental health concerns with patients, and personal willingness to speak with a provider regarding personal mental health. A significant reduction was seen in candidates who personally sought counseling. There was no significant difference in inquiring about personal assistance with mental health concerns or involvement in extracurricular activities within pharmacy school. CONCLUSIONS A psychiatry module in pharmacy education may positively impact mental health stigma and the ability of pharmacy candidates to openly discuss mental illness as well as improve medication counseling skills for patients needing psychotropic medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1014,35125199,"Development of a combination didactic-experiential elective course within a college-based pharmacy call center. BACKGROUND Pharmacy graduates should be prepared to provide patient care in a variety of healthcare settings as members of an interprofessional collaborative team. College-based pharmacy call centers can serve as settings to promote interprofessional practice through didactic and experiential coursework. An elective course, Team-Based Medication Management Practices, was developed to provide student pharmacists the opportunity to learn about pharmacy-led services within value-based care models and to prepare them for interprofessional care by incorporating experiential activities within a college-based call center. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY A two-credit elective course was offered to third-year pharmacy students. The course was delivered through a combination of didactic lectures and experiential activities within a college-based pharmacy call center, with modules focused on medication adherence, medication therapy management, and transitions of care. A survey was administered to students at the end of the course to evaluate perceptions. FINDINGS Six students enrolled in the elective and completed the survey. Most students ""strongly agreed"" or ""agreed"" that they gained a better understanding of interprofessional care within value-based care models and pharmacy services that can be provided within a college-based call center while acquiring patient care skills. The role of telehealth in the delivery of pharmacist-led patient care services is likely to continue expanding as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and it will become increasingly important to train students to provide these services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1015,35125200,"Implementing and evaluating a course in professional ethics for an undergraduate pharmacy curriculum: A feasibility study. BACKGROUND Pharmacy practice today mandates ""patient-centered care"", thereby assigning higher levels of professional responsibility for pharmacists leading to ethical challenges. These challenges often involve ethical principles, institutional, personal, or other constraints that can pull practitioners in incompatible opposite directions, creating ""ethical dilemmas"" in many circumstances. Pharmacists are expected to handle challenges competently and in the best interest of patients. Literature underlines the positive impact of educational interventions focusing on ethical awareness and competence, and that ""gaps"" existed in pharmacy training/curricula for Jordanian pharmacists. The objective of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the utility of a tailored ethics education component in the pharmacy curriculum for students enrolled at a well-ranked Jordanian university. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Fifth-year pharmacy students attending summer school at a university in Jordan from July to September 2020 were invited to participate in an educational intervention (suite of didactic online lectures and skills-based workshops). This study was delivered in four parts, with a pretest administered immediately before and a posttest survey immediately after the educational intervention, the educational intervention (three phases), and focus-group discussions to elicit students' feedback. FINDINGS Findings indicated enhanced levels of confidence in students' decision-making. The development of students' moral reasoning and decision-making skills were also observed to be improved.

1016,35125293,"Evaluation of an educational strategy to improve medication reconciliation in ambulatory care. BACKGROUND Improper medication reconciliation can result in inaccurate medication lists. When medication lists are inaccurate, it can result in drug-drug interactions, dosing errors, and medication duplication. Interventions targeting medication reconciliation have had varying levels of success. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe the medication reconciliation educational program, its implementation in a health care system, pharmacist and clinic personnel perception of the program, and its impact on clinic personnel knowledge and practice. METHODS Guided by the Conceptual Model of Implementation Research, a partially mixed sequential dominant status evaluation of a pharmacist-led educational program on evidence-based practices for medication reconciliation implemented into all primary care clinic sites by examining implementation outcomes was conducted. The implementation outcomes measured include penetration, fidelity, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and adoption. Data were collected through program data and direct observations, pre- and postsurveys, and semistructured interviews of pharmacists and clinic personnel. RESULTS Of 46 primary care sites, 37 primary care sites (80%) implemented the pharmacist-delivered medication reconciliation education from April to June 2021 with representation from each of Geisinger's regions. Ten clinic sites (27%) completed the medication reconciliation educational program as originally designed, with the remainder adapting the program. A total of 296 clinic personnel completed the presurvey, and 178 completed the postsurvey. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between clinic personnel who completed the pre- versus postsurvey. All clinic personnel interviewed felt satisfied with the educational program and felt it was appropriate because it directly affected their job. Clinic personnel felt the educational program was acceptable and appropriate; two major concerns were discussed: a lack of patient knowledge about their medications and a lack of time to complete the medication reconciliation. The adherence rate to the elements of the medication reconciliation that were covered in the education program ranged from 0% to 95% in the 55 observations conducted. CONCLUSION An educational program for medication reconciliation was found to be acceptable and appropriate but was often adapted to fit site-specific needs. Additional barriers affected adoption of best practices and should be addressed in future studies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1017,35125906,"Cross-sectional study to evaluate burnout among pharmacy staff in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic. Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed healthcare workers, including pharmacists, at an increased risk of infection and has increased their workload, which could lead to burnout. Therefore, the present study aimed to measure the levels of burnout among hospital and community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify the risk factors associated with burnout. Methods In the present cross-sectional study, an online survey was distributed among community and hospital (inpatient, outpatient, clinical, and administration) pharmacists in Saudi Arabia. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory(CBI) survey was used to measure burnout levels. This 19-item survey covered three aspects: personal, work, and patient-related burnout. The survey included questions about socio-demographic factors and the major causes of psychological distress among pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inferential statistics were used for data analysis. Results A total of 502 pharmacists were included in the present study. Of these, 59.1% were categorized as having clinically relevant burnout levels(scores≥50).Univariate analysis revealed that the burnout level was significantly higher(p<0.05) among pharmacists who were younger, were females, had lesser years of experience, or worked in the community pharmacy. The main factors associated with high burnout levels among community pharmacists were younger age, lesser years of experience, male gender, non-Saudi nationality, and higher numbers of customers. In the COVID-19 part of the survey, burnout was found to be strongly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fears of getting infected or of a family member getting infected, fears of the pandemic lasting for too long, and increased working hours were factors contributing to increased burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic with unadjusted β of 8.336 and(95% CI 7.082-9.589, p value < 0.001). A lack of supportive work culture and sleeping disturbances were also found to be related to high burnout levels(p<0.001).

1018,35126195,"Burnout in the Pharmaceutical Activity: The Impact of COVID-19. Importance Pharmacists are among the healthcare professionals involved in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining essential services. In the context of restrictions and reorganization of human resources, as a result of policies recently applied to the health sector, following international guidelines, and given the scarcity of data on burnout in pharmaceutical activity, it was considered highly relevant to promote a nationwide survey aiming to collect more complete evidence on the burnout syndrome and to understand how pharmacists have viewed their work and the people they worked closely with. Objectives The study aimed to assess the occurrence of pharmacist burnout and determine outcomes for each of its dimensions; identify potentially associated characteristics; and determine profiles and critical limits. Design A cross-sectional observational study conducted by a multidisciplinary panel from the Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society (PPS). Professionals from community and hospital pharmacies who were at the forefront of the COVID-19 response were involved in (i) confirming the need and pertinence for conducting this research, (ii) identifying the main factors leading to pharmaceutical emotional distress (""burnout""), and (iii) disseminating the survey. The questionnaire was designed for digital voluntary, confidential, and anonymous participation and divided into four segments of data collection: (i) demographics, (ii) employment and workplace characterization, (iii) pandemic impact on labor activity, and (iv) burnout assessment (as described ahead). Setting An electronic survey was addressed to all PPS members, and an account was created solely to manage the questionnaire data for the research team.

1019,35126891,"Development of the first edition of African treatment guidelines for common bacterial infections and syndromes.  Standard treatment guidelines (STGs) are an important tool for ensuring high quality clinical care and prudent antimicrobial use (AMU) and stewardship (AMS). In 2018, African Union (AU) member state representatives recognized the lack of STGs as a barrier to AMS at national and facility levels. Previous research reported that only 17 of 55 (31%) member states had STGs that provided disease- or pathogen-specific antimicrobial treatment recommendations, excluding those that covered only treatment of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis). The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention convened expert panels to develop first edition antibiotic treatment guidelines for priority infectious diseases and clinical syndromes for pediatric and adult patient populations in Africa. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide healthcare workers with treatment guidance by harmonising existing national STGs, filling gaps where existing STGs are not available, and serving as a model for future guidelines. Two expert panels of 28 total clinicians, pharmacists, and other relevant stakeholders from 14 AU member states representing each continental region convened to develop consensus treatment recommendations for select priority bacterial infections and clinical syndromes. In developing recommendations, the panels considered treatment recommendations from existing STGs, drug availability, clinical experience, and available antimicrobial resistance data. The guidelines underwent an external review process where clinical stakeholders who did not serve on either panel were invited to submit feedback prior to their publication. The guidelines provide empiric antibiotic therapy guidelines - including drug selection, route of administration, formulation, dosage, and therapy duration - and principles of stewardship for 28 bacterial infections or clinical syndromes. The first edition guidelines for the treatment of common infectious diseases and clinical syndromes in Africa aims to improve clinical treatment and antimicrobial stewardship and will serve as a template for future regional guidelines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Smoking cessation is critical in secondary prevention after stroke and transient ischemic attack. Data regarding use of smoking-cessation interventions after stroke and transient ischemic attack are sparse. We examined the use of prescription smoking-cessation medications in these patients. This is a retrospective cohort study using 2013-2016 data from the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network, comprised of Medicare prescription claims data merged with electronic health record data for patients receiving care across five New York City health care institutions. Active smoking was ascertained based on a validated ICD-9-CM diagnosis code or the presence of an electronic health record active smoking indicator, reflecting clinician-entered data in the health record. The primary outcome was a claim for any prescription smoking-cessation medication (varenicline or bupropion) within 12 months of hospital discharge. We evaluated claims for any statin medication as a comparator because statins are a standard component of stroke secondary prevention. We identified 3,153 patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack who were active smokers at the time of their event. Among these patients, 3.1% (95% CI, 2.5-3.9) had a pharmacy claim for a prescription smoking-cessation medication at 6 months, and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.9-5.6) did at 12 months hospital discharge.

1021,35128316,"A multidisciplinary approach to prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2019-case report.  Patients with novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Currently there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 available; thus, for patients with severe ARDS, the respiratory condition needs to improve while on ECMO support. Here we present a multidisciplinary team approach to the care of a patient with COVID-related ARDS requiring three months of veno-venous (VV) ECMO which lead to recovery. A 35-year-old male was transferred to us with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection with a lactate 13.7 mmol/L and an arterial-blood gas oxygenation of 75 mmHg on maximum ventilator settings. He was placed on VV ECMO during which he developed pneumonia, bacteremia, and pneumothoraces; however, his other organ functions were preserved. During his time in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), multiple subspecialist teams participated in his care including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, nutritionists, case management, and social work. The VV ECMO was weaned off after 91 days of support, after which he had a prolonged hospital course due to inflammatory bowel disease, and aspiration pneumonia. CT scan performed six weeks prior to discharge showed mild improvement in diffuse airspace opacities superimposed on extensive chronic cystic changes. He was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility 68 days after ECMO removal. He was then seen in our outpatient pulmonary clinic one month and our Post-Intensive Care Syndrome clinic three months after discharge on two liters of nasal cannula oxygen. Pulmonary function testing done at this time demonstrated severe restrictive lung disease and severely reduced diffusion capacity. This case highlights the need for multidisciplinary collaboration among hospital teams to ensure success and patient survival in the setting of COVID ARDS. In those COVID ARDS patients with intact renal, metabolic, hematologic, and cardiovascular function, ECMO should be strongly considered.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and work on the mental health and wellbeing of pharmacists in Nigeria and investigate the risk of exhaustion, disengagement, burnout, and their associated factors. Methods This was an online cross-sectional study among pharmacists that involved the use of mental health and wellbeing questionnaire including a 16-item OLBI questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to determine the study distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, while independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare the mean values of two and three groups, respectively. Tukey posthoc test was used to compare various practice settings based on significant factors, while a two-sided Dunnett t-test was used to compare between groups for other significant factors. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 612 pharmacists invited to participate in the survey, 426 completed and submitted the questionnaire giving a response rate of 69.6%. The Cronbach's alpha for wellness and mental health survey instrument in our study population is 0.74, while the average Cronbach's alpha for a 16-item OLBI questionnaire is 0.62 in our study population. The high risk of exhaustion and disengagement were met by 75.6% and 77.2% of the respondents, respectively. Eighty-three respondents (19.5%) met thresholds for either high risk of exhaustion or disengagement, while 66.2% had both a high risk of exhaustion and disengagement (burnout). Significant proportions of respondents with undergraduate pharmacy degree as the highest qualification obtained (70.6%, p < 0.001), in the hospital practice setting (62.8%, p < 0.001), and in full-time employment type (68.1%, p = 0.004) had the higher risk of burnout compared to their counterparts. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and work significantly impacted the mental health and wellbeing of a considerable proportion of the respondents. Burnout affects the majority of pharmacists in Nigeria and is linked to undergraduate pharmacy degrees as the highest qualification obtained, hospital practice settings, and full-time employment. Thus, mitigating strategies from employees, government, and organizations are recommended to help improve working conditions and promote the well-being of pharmacists in Nigeria.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1023,35129031,"Budget impact and pharmacy costs with targeted use of oliceridine for postsurgical pain in patients at high risk of opioid-related adverse events. BACKGROUND Oliceridine, a new class of μ-opioid receptor agonist, may be associated with fewer opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs) due to its unique mechanism of action. Thus, it may provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional opioids such as morphine. PATIENTS AND METHODS Using a decision tree with a 24-hour time horizon, we calculated costs for medication and management of the three most common AEs (oxygen saturation <90%, vomiting, somnolence) following postoperative oliceridine or morphine in high-risk patients. Costs were enumerated as differences in cost of analgesics and resource utilization in the first 24 hours post-surgery. An economic model compared expected AEs and costs in a blended cohort where elderly/obese patients at higher risk for ORAEs received oliceridine while those presumed to be at lower risk received morphine with a cohort that received morphine alone. RESULTS In high-risk patients, use of oliceridine resulted in overall savings of $363,944 (in 1,000 patients). Implementing a targeted approach of oliceridine utilization in patients with high risk for ORAEs can save a typical hospital system $122,296 in total cost of care. CONCLUSION Use of oliceridine in postoperative care among patients at high risk provides a favorable health economic benefit compared to the use of morphine.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of drug-related emergency department (ED) visits and associated risk factors. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in the ED, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway. From April 2017 to May 2018, 402 patients allocated to the intervention group in a randomized controlled trial were included in this sub-study. During their ED visit, these patients received medication reconciliation and medication review conducted by study pharmacists, in addition to standard care. Retrospectively, an interdisciplinary team assessed the reconciled drug list and identified drug-related issues alongside demographics, final diagnosis, and laboratory tests for all patients to determine whether their ED visit was drug-related. The study population's median age was 67 years (IQR 27, range 19-96), and patients used a median of 4 regular drugs (IQR 6, range 0-19). In total, 79 (19.7%) patients had a drug-related ED visits, and identified risk factors were increasing age, increasing number of regular drugs and medical referral reason. Adverse effects (72.2%) and non-adherence (16.5%) were the most common causes of drug-related ED visits. Antithrombotic agents were most frequently involved in drug-related ED visits, while immunosuppressants had the highest relative frequency. Only 11.4% of the identified drug-related ED visits were documented by physicians during ED/hospital stay. In the investigated population, 19.7% had a drug-related ED visit, indicating that drug-related ED visits are a major concern. If not recognized and handled, this could be a threat against patient safety.

1025,35130448,"Non-prescription pharmacy syringes sales to people who inject drugs (PWID) in Khartoum, Sudan: policy, practice, and perceptions. BACKGROUND People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of contracting blood-borne infections. Many developed countries started a needle exchange program to provide PWID with sterile syringes. In Sudan, healthcare professionals are exposed to legal liability if they cooperate with people who use drugs; therefore, the accessibility to sterile syringes without prescription depends heavily on pharmacists' knowledge and attitude toward PWID. OBJECTIVES Assessing policy, practice, and perceptions of pharmacists toward selling sterile syringes to PWID in Khartoum, Sudan. METHODS A self-administered questionnaire was given to 157 pharmacists (57 male, 100 female). RESULTS Out of 157 participating pharmacists, 86.6% reported selling syringes without a medical prescription, 53.5% inquired about the reason for buying syringes, and 87.9% refused to sell the syringes to a PWID. 43.3% of participating pharmacists were uncertain about the presence of law to regulate selling syringes without prescriptions. Although 47.7% of the participants agreed that selling empty syringes without a medical prescription to PWID will reduce harm, 68.5% will not sell them to PWID without a medical prescription even if it is encouraged by law due to their religious or moral beliefs. CONCLUSION Pharmacists are the main providers of clean syringes for PWID in Khartoum, Sudan. With the majority of them reporting refusal to provide syringes to PWID, this may put PWID at higher risk of contracting blood-borne infections due syringe sharing. This is a challenge to overcome in planning for effective harm reduction programs in Khartoum.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1027,35130945,"HealthCare educational differences in pain management, adverse childhood experiences and their relationship to substance use disorder education. BACKGROUND In order to assist the State of Ohio in the United States in addressing the opioid epidemic, the Ohio Attorney General appointed experts in a variety of academic disciplines to the Scientific Committee on Opioid Prevention and Education (SCOPE). The focus of SCOPE is the application of scientific principles in the development of prevention and educational strategies for reducing substance use disorder (SUD). One area of focus for SCOPE was SUD education of healthcare professionals. The objective of the present was to identify the content and extent to which future healthcare professionals are trained in pain management, SUD, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). METHODS In December of 2019, a survey was distributed to 49 healthcare professional schools in Ohio that included the following disciplines: medicine, pharmacy, advanced practice registered nurse (APRN), physician assistant, dentistry, and optometry. The survey included four domains: initial screening of patients, training in SUD, training in care for patients at high risk for SUD, and education in evaluating patients for ACEs. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS Thirty one of the forty-nine schools completed the survey. Most disciplines indicated that some form of basic training in the principles of SUD were taught in their core curriculum. The training on ethical issues surrounding SUD were not as widely covered (range 0-62.5%). Medicine, APRN, physician assistant, and pharmacy schools had a ""moderate"" to ""great"" extent of pharmacologic therapy curriculum integration. Other pain management strategies were ""somewhat"" to ""moderately"" integrated. There were variations seen in training on risk of medication misuse based on various contributors to health. At least 67.7% of medicine, APRN, physician assistant, and pharmacy programs included motivational interviewing training. The extent to which schools integrated education regarding ACEs into their curriculum varied from 0 to 66.7%. CONCLUSIONS The study finding suggests a need for a unified, consistent, and expanded training requirement in the foundations of pain management, SUD, and ACEs in professional healthcare education.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean cumulative knowledge score increased from 55.2% to 81.5% and the mean cumulative confidence score improved from 34.2% to 81.8%. Free text responses garnered positive feedback from students stating the APPE allowed them to immerse themselves in all stages of the recovery process, increase confidence in presentation skills with patients, and solidified their passion for addiction medicine.Conclusion. A novel APPE in addiction medicine addressed a current gap in pharmacy education, earned positive evaluations from student pharmacists, increased student knowledge and confidence related to SUD, harm reduction, and co-occurring disorders, and supported the development of new interprofessional collaborations. United States colleges of pharmacy that do not yet offer APPEs in this clinical domain should consider this model.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1030,35132006,"Hyperglycemia Management Prior to Admission in an Urban Emergency Department. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients admitted with blood glucose (BG) level above 250 mg/dL to less than 20%. METHODS A work group comprised physicians, pharmacists, and endocrinologists collaborated to standardize management of ED hyperglycemia. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles included education, monitoring of patients with BG level above 200 mg/dL, and development of an ED-specific insulin protocol. RESULTS Following the initiative, 24.8% fewer patients were admitted with BG level above 250 mg/dL. The average admission BG level was reduced by 65.8 mg/dL, creating a significant shift toward improved average BG level. No difference was seen in hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, ED length of stay, hypoglycemia, or inhospital diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. CONCLUSION Implementation of a standardized hyperglycemia treatment protocol along with pharmacist interventions reduced average admission BG and the percentage of patients with BG level above 250 mg/dL on admission.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1031,35132050,"Knowledge, Confidence, and Perception Toward Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Among Physicians and Pharmacists in Kuwait. BACKGROUND Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) helps ensure an efficient and safe therapeutic outcome. This study assessed physicians' and pharmacists' knowledge, confidence, and perception regarding clinical pharmacokinetics (CPK) and TDM. METHODS A cross-sectional survey which employed a self-administered questionnaire was used. A stratified random sample of 322 physicians and pharmacists across three Kuwait public hospitals was surveyed. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were performed during data analysis. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with low levels of knowledge and confidence and negative perceptions among the subjects. RESULTS The response rate was 88%. Overall, the respondents' mean total knowledge score percentage was low (50.3%) with no significant difference between the physicians' and pharmacists' scores (P>0.5); 60.4% of the participants (95% CI: 54.9-65.6) felt confident when employing TDM in their practice. Most participants expressed positive perceptions (90.1%; 95% CI:86.3-92.9) toward TDM. There was high agreement internally that pharmacists require some knowledge of TDM, should be asked by physicians in general for recommendations on the appropriate use of TDM, and should be able to provide relevant information regarding the appropriate use of TDM. CONCLUSION Physicians and pharmacists in this study had high confidence in-and the positive perceptions of-TDM and its clinical implications. The present study's findings indicate an urgent need for professional education and training in CPK and TDM and its clinical implications through continuous professional development programs and its integration within the curricula of medical and pharmacy schools.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1032,35132528,"Barriers and motivators to national board certification as a certified anticoagulation care provider.  Professionals voice confusion between the distinctions of board certification and educational certificate courses, and note barriers and motivators in obtaining national anticoagulation board certification. To identify barriers vs. motivators in obtaining board certification and detail the differences in board certification and educational certificate courses, an IRB-approved electronic survey was sent to professionals completing the University of Southern Indiana (USI) Anticoagulation Therapy educational certificate course (n = 491) and existing Certified Anticoagulation Care Providers (CACP, n = 622). A total of 1049 surveys were delivered successfully, with a 26% response rate (USI = 62, CACP = 211.) Respondents identified as a nurse (n = 52, 19%), advanced practice nurse (n = 14, 5.1%), pharmacist (n = 206, 75.5%) or physician (n = 5, 1.8%). Overall, respondents indicated board certification via CACP has significant impact on patient/organizational outcomes (n = 118, 43.2%). Top motivators for board certification include personal accomplishment (n = 147, 53%) and professional growth (n = 139, 50.9%). Top barriers include lack of time to prepare (n = 102, 37.3%,) board certification exam cost (n = 95, 34.8%), and for CACP recertification, and requirement to recertify by examination (n = 74, 35.1%). Of board-certified respondents, 45.4% indicated they were not employed at an Anticoagulation Center of Excellence (ACE), 34.8% employed at an ACE and 16.8% were unsure of ACE status. Narrative comments were obtained and evaluated. Significant personal and professional barriers exist in completing, and subsequently maintaining, board certification in anticoagulation. This offers great insight for NCBAP to invoke changes to support clinicians and healthcare organizations in seeking and maintaining CACP credentialing, a component of ACE attainment.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1033,35132895,"Impact of Initial Therapy on Readmissions in Minority Versus White Populations With Heart Failure. BACKGROUND Minority populations are often underrepresented in landmark trials for the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Major trials shaping the guidelines sometimes include as few as 5% black patients. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF on hospital discharge for minority vs white populations and its impact on all-cause 30-day readmission rates to identify areas for larger future research studies and opportunities for pharmacist intervention. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with HFrEF patients discharged over a 3-month period. The primary objective was to compare all-cause 30-day readmissions in minority vs white patients with HFrEF who were discharged on initial GDMT. RESULTS 300 patients were included in this study, with 188 patients in the minority group and 112 patients in the white group. The minority group was predominantly African American (92%). The primary endpoint demonstrated significantly higher 30-day all-cause readmissions in minority patients compared to white patients who received initial GDMT (20.5 vs 7.7%, P = .0144), despite similar rates of GDMT therapy between groups. CONCLUSION Initial GDMT in minority patients may not reduce readmissions to the same extent seen in white patients. Special emphasis should be placed on evaluating minority patients with HFrEF for additional therapeutic interventions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1034,35135388,"Knowledge and Perception Regarding the Development and Acceptability of Male Contraceptives Among Pharmacists: A Mixed Sequential Method.  Community pharmacists play a crucial role in providing comprehensive patient education regarding contraception methods. This study aims to investigate Jordanian pharmacists' knowledge and perceptions toward male oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). A mixed-explanatory sequential method was divided into two phases. The first was a self-administered electronic survey that was distributed to community pharmacists/trainees in Jordan. The second phase was carried out through online semi-structured in-depth interviews targeting the maximum variation purposive sample of community pharmacists. A total of 158 (response rate 98%) questionnaires were included in the analysis. The majority of the participants were female (n = 118, 74.2%). In terms of knowledge, only 25% of participants acknowledged the presence of male OCPs and almost half were uncertain about the mechanism of action and the possible uses. The findings of the interviews confirmed a relatively negative perception toward male OCPs and the identified barriers to male OCPs were cultural norms, side effects, and poor compliance. It is argued that there is a negative perception toward male OCPs due to the majority of pharmacists not believing such products will be successful in Jordan. Once these pills are approved for their effectiveness and safety, men may need further education and encouragement to take an active role in family planning along with their partners.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1035,35135535,"Perception of community pharmacists about the work process of drug dispensing: a cross-sectional survey study. BACKGROUND Drug dispensing aims to promote rational medicine use. However, in many countries, the work processes are still not well defined. In this sense, the perception of pharmacists about dispensing practices presents an overview of how the service is being performed in the country and its main challenges. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the self-reported work process of Brazilian community pharmacists in relation to drug dispensing, challenges, and strategies for carrying out the service. METHOD A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May and July 2021, with community pharmacists from all regions of Brazil. Pharmacists were invited to answer a validated, self-administered questionnaire, implemented through Google Forms, containing 33 questions related to the steps of drug dispensing (questions and counseling) and the main challenges and strategies to perform the service. The data were exported to Microsoft Office Excel and SPSS®. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between responses and demographic information, with a significance level of less than 5% (p < 0.05). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (number: 4.295.171). RESULTS A total of 625 community pharmacists responded to the survey. Most pharmacists reported always or frequently performing 17 (54%) of the 31 steps described in the instrument. The steps that pharmacists reported performing more frequently were forming the medication name (n = 569, 91.04%), verifying the completeness and adequacy of the prescription according to current legislation (n = 567, 90.72%) and providing counseling on dosage (n = 549, 87.84%). Documentation was the main step in which pharmacists reported never or rarely performing (n = 424, 67.84%). The results showed that there was a significant influence of the variables of public education institution, age, and postgraduate education on the frequency of dispensing steps (F(3, 621) = 14.884, p < 0.001; R2ajdusted = 0,063). CONCLUSION This study showed that most pharmacists reported always or frequently asking most of the questions and performing counseling contained in the instrument during drug dispensing. These results can contribute to an understanding of current dispensing practices and generate insights for developing strategies to qualify the service.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1036,35135583,"How do changes in motivation to prevent pregnancy influence contraceptive continuation? Results from a longitudinal study with women who receive family planning services from Community Pharmacists and Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors in Nigeria. BACKGROUND Studies have shown that motivation to avoid pregnancy is associated with contraceptive use and continuation. These motivations can change, however, even within a short period of time. This paper uses longitudinal data to look at women's motivation to avoid pregnancy at two time points, and how changes in motivation influence contraceptive continuation. METHODS Data for this analysis came from an evaluation of the IntegratE project which seeks to expand access to family planning (FP) in Nigeria through community pharmacies and drug shops. 491 women were interviewed within 10 days after receiving a FP service from these sources and again approximately 9 months later. The dependent variable was contraceptive continuation at the follow-up interview. A categorical independent variable was used to represent changes in motivation to avoid pregnancy from enrollment to the follow-up interview. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between changes in motivation and contraceptive continuation. RESULTS 89% of women continued using contraception approximately 9 months after the enrollment interview. Women who remained highly motivated to avoid pregnancy were significantly more likely to continue using contraception compared to women who became more motivated (AOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.0-6.0). Women who became less motivated were 64% less likely to continue using contraception compared to who became more motivated (AOR 0.36 95% CI 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSION FP providers, including private sector pharmacists and drug shop owners, should continuously check-in with women about their motivations around pregnancy to support continuation among those who wish to avoid pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND Disease-related malnutrition is common in patients with chronic diseases and has detrimental effects, therefore, skills in nutrition care are essential core competencies for paediatric digestive medicine. The aim of this survey, conducted as part of a global survey of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (PGHN) training in Europe, was to assess nutrition care-related infrastructure, staff, and patient volumes in European PGHN training centres. METHODS Standardized questionnaires related to clinical nutrition (CN) care were completed by representatives of European PGHN training centres between June 2016 and December 2019. RESULTS One hundred training centres from 17 European countries, Turkey, and Israel participated in the survey. Dedicated CN clinics exist in 66% of the centres, with fulltime and part-time CN specialists in 66% and 42%, respectively. Home tube feeding (HTF) and home parenteral nutrition (HPN) programmes are in place in 95% and 77% of centres, respectively. Twenty-four percent of centres do not have a dedicated dietitian and 55% do not have a dedicated pharmacist attached to the training centre. Even the largest centres with >5000 outpatients reported that 25% and 50%, respectively do not have a dedicated dietitian or pharmacist. Low patient numbers on HTF and HPN of <5 annually are reported by 13% and 43% of centres, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The survey shows clear differences and deficits in Clinical Nutrition training infrastructure, including staff and patient volumes, in European PGHN training centres, leading to large differences and limitations in training opportunities in Clinical Nutrition.

1039,35136476,"Exploring reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers in Ethiopia. Introduction the World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health. The purpose of this study was to explore factors contributing to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers, their perspectives regarding vaccine uptake by the public and their recommendations to improve vaccine uptake in Ethiopia. Methods a phenomenological qualitative study was conducted among purposively selected healthcare providers working in the Ministry of Health (MoH), regulatory authority, public and private hospitals and health centres who hesitated to take the COVID-19 vaccine in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in June 2021. A total of twenty in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured open-ended interview guide. Participants included nurses, physicians, pharmacists, health officers, Medical Laboratory technologists and midwives. A qualitative content analysis approach was chosen to analyse the data. Results all the participants agreed (n=20) that lack of consistent information and inadequate evidence about COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy and quality were the main reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. History of perceived and confirmed COVID-19 infection history, misinformation, religious views, unknown short and long-term effects of the vaccine and undefined length of time of vaccine´s protection were also other reasons mentioned by the participants. Conclusion healthcare providers were hesitant toward COVID-19 vaccine mainly due to lack of clear evidence regarding the vaccine´s short and long-term safety, efficacy and quality profiles. Hence, the long-term safety and efficacy of the vaccine should be extensively studied and evidence dissemination and communication should be clear and transparent.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1040,35136913,"Detecting drug diversion in health-system data using machine learning and advanced analytics. PURPOSE The theft of drugs from healthcare facilities, also known as drug diversion, occurs frequently but is often undetected. This paper describes a research study to develop and test novel drug diversion detection methods. Improved diversion detection and reduction in diversion improves patient safety, limits harm to the person diverting, reduces the public health impact of substance use disorder, and mitigates significant liability risk to pharmacists and their organizations. METHODS Ten acute care inpatient hospitals across 4 independent health systems extracted 2 datasets from various health information technology systems. Both datasets were consolidated, normalized, classified, and sampled to provide a harmonious dataset for analysis. Supervised machine learning methods were iteratively used on the initial sample dataset to train algorithms to classify medication movement transactions as involving a low or high risk of diversion. Thereafter, the resulting machine learning model classified the risk of diversion in a historical dataset capturing 8 to 24 months of history that included 27.9 million medication movement transactions by 19,037 nursing, 1,047 pharmacy, and 712 anesthesia clinicians and that included 22 known, blinded diversion cases to measure when the model would have detected the diversion compared to when the diversion was actually detected by existing methods. RESULTS The machine learning model had 95.9% specificity and 96.6% sensitivity in detecting transactions involving a high risk of diversion using the initial sample dataset. In subsequent testing using the much larger historical dataset, the analytics detected known diversion cases (n = 22) in blinded data faster than existing detection methods (a mean of 160 days and a median of 74 days faster; range, 7-579 days faster). CONCLUSION The study showed that (1) consolidated datasets and (2) supervised machine learning can detect known diversion cases faster than existing detection methods. Users of the technology also noted improved investigation efficiency.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1041,35136920,"Impact of a pharmacist-led telehealth oral chemotherapy clinic. PURPOSE Oral oncolytics come with significant concerns of noncompliance due to complex regimens, adverse effects, and high overall costs. The Geisinger Oral Chemotherapy Clinic is a fully telephone-based medication therapy disease management (MTDM) program designed to integrate pharmacists as advanced practitioners in hematology/oncology clinics for comanagement of oral chemotherapy. SUMMARY To date, Geisinger has 11 oncology clinics and 3 full-time pharmacists designated to the management of oral chemotherapy. Pharmacists receive referrals for comanagement of patients starting oral oncolytics. Under a collaborative practice agreement, they can order laboratory tests as well as supportive care medications and refills. Pharmacists review planned therapies, perform medication reconciliations, and provide medication counseling. Once treatment has been initiated, pharmacists contact patients for laboratory and toxicity assessments. The clinic incorporates the use of customized smart data elements within the electronic medical record to collect data regarding pharmacist interventions and time allocations in the clinic. As of March 31, 2021, the clinic was actively following approximately 1,100 patients, resulting in an average of 80 to 90 encounters per day for new referrals, chemotherapy education, and laboratory and toxicity assessments. Approximately 2,113 patients were followed from December 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021, with 46,929 interventions documented. CONCLUSION By obtaining provider buy-in for pharmacy services, acquiring enough personnel resources to meet the needs of the growing patient population and respective therapies, and proper utilization of technology, the program has thrived, allowing for increased provider and patient satisfaction. Future goals include expanding collection of pharmacist intervention metrics and analysis of patient perceptions of services provided by the clinic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1042,35136936,"Pharmacists' impact on quality and financial metrics utilizing virtual care platforms during the coronavirus pandemic. PURPOSE Because of rising concern about coronavirus disease 2019 transmission, there has been a large shift from face-to-face, in-office visits to a virtual care model. The purpose of this article is to explain how Ascension Florida Gulf Coast was able to maximize the utility of ambulatory care pharmacists (ACPs) in the primary care setting during the pandemic and to provide guidance for creating a sustainable billing and practice model in the event of another global health crisis. SUMMARY By employing telehealth services, our ACPs were able to continue to co-manage chronic disease states for documented diagnoses while still maintaining health-system revenue in the midst of a global health crisis. Utilizing various virtual platforms, ACPs were able to accommodate the needs of our patients while addressing concerns related to the compatibility and user friendliness of the platforms for our diverse patient population. ACPs used traditional incident-to evaluation and management services current procedural terminology billing codes with a virtual visit modifier for billing and tracking purposes. CONCLUSION Utilizing various virtual care platforms, our ACPs completed 447 patient encounters within the first 7 months of the pandemic. During this time, our ACPs addressed various population health metrics, specifically for patients diagnosed with diabetes without an active claim for a cholesterol-lowering medication, in addition to performing chronic disease management. Our ACPs had a 23% success rate for statin initiation in patients reviewed and contacted. By adopting virtual care options, our ACPs were able to effectively co-manage and educate patients while improving quality metrics and generating $50,662.24 in billable encounters for the health system during a global health crisis.

1043,35136945,"Real-world evaluation of insulin requirements after GLP1 agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and titration. PURPOSE To describe insulin adjustments made following initiation of glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist (GLP1a) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy in patients within a primary care setting. METHODS This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study conducted at an academic health system. Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiated on a GLP1a or SGLT2i while on insulin and managed by an ambulatory care pharmacist were included. The primary endpoint was the percent change in total daily insulin dose at specified time points (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months) after agent initiation. The secondary endpoints included a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of less than 8%, change from baseline HbA1c, and safety profiles of GLP1a therapy and SGLT2i therapy. RESULTS Of the 150 patients included, 123 were initiated on a GLP1a and 27 on an SGLT2i. After 6 months, GLP1a initiation had resulted in a mean 23.5% decrease (P < 0.001) in insulin dosage and SGLT2i resulted in a mean 0.2% increase (P = 0.20). Insulin dosage reduction with GLP1a use was significantly different between baseline and each time point (P < 0.001). About 72% of patients initiated on a GLP1a and 59% of those initiated on an SGLT2i achieved an HbA1c value of less than 8%. The mean absolute change from baseline in HbA1c concentration was -1.7% with GLP1a use and -1.5% with SGLT2i use (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with baseline values). Hypoglycemia occurred in 21% of patients on a GLP1a and 11% of those on an SGLT2i. CONCLUSION After GLP1a initiation, the mean total daily insulin dose decreased by 23.5%; after SGLT2i initiation, insulin requirements increased by a mean of 0.2%. These results will help guide insulin adjustments after initiation of these medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1044,35138252,"Integrating and Disseminating Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Screening and Dispensing for Black Men Who Have Sex With Men in Atlanta, Georgia: Protocol for Community Pharmacies. BACKGROUND Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) suffer from alarmingly high rates of HIV in the United States. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 99% among men who have sex with men, yet profound racial disparities in the uptake of PrEP persist. Low PrEP uptake in BMSM is driven by poor access to PrEP, including inconvenient locations of PrEP-prescribing physicians, distrust of physicians, and stigma, which limit communication about PrEP and its side effects. Previous work indicates that offering HIV prevention services in pharmacies located in low-income, underserved neighborhoods is feasible and can reduce stigma because pharmacies offer a host of less stigmatized health services (eg, vaccinations). We present a protocol for a pharmacy PrEP model that seeks to address challenges and barriers to pharmacy-based PrEP specifically for BMSM. OBJECTIVE We aim to develop a sustainable pharmacy PrEP delivery model for BMSM that can be implemented to increase PrEP access in low-income, underserved neighborhoods. METHODS This study design is a pilot intervention to test a pharmacy PrEP delivery model among pharmacy staff and BMSM. We will examine the PrEP delivery model's feasibility, acceptability, and safety and gather early evidence of its impact and cost with respect to PrEP uptake. A mixed-methods approach will be performed, including three study phases: (1) a completed formative phase with qualitative interviews from key stakeholders; (2) a completed transitional pilot phase to assess customer eligibility and willingness to receive PrEP in pharmacies during COVID-19; and (3) a planned pilot intervention phase which will test the delivery model in 2 Atlanta pharmacies in low-income, underserved neighborhoods. RESULTS Data from the formative phase showed strong support of pharmacy-based PrEP delivery among BMSM, pharmacists, and pharmacy staff. Important factors were identified to facilitate the implementation of PrEP screening and dissemination in pharmacies. During the transitional pilot phase, we identified 81 individuals who would have been eligible for the pilot phase. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacies have proven to be a feasible source for offering PrEP for White men who have sex with men but have failed to reach the most at-risk, vulnerable population (ie, BMSM). Increasing PrEP access and uptake will reduce HIV incidence and racial inequities in HIV. Translational studies are required to build further evidence and scale pharmacy-based PrEP services specifically for populations that are disconnected from HIV prevention resources.

1045,35138704,"[Drug-related health damage].  Gurwitz and colleagues showed that a complex intervention, aimed at a reduction of drug-related adverse events and medication errors immediately after hospital discharge, did not result in a significant outcome difference between the intervention and control groups. We feel that the intervention lacked standardization, that a better outcome might have been achieved by intervening prior to hospital discharge, that more details about the nature of observed medication errors and acceptance of the intervenor recommendations should have been reported. Also, the number of unpreventable adverse drug events was higher in the intervention (n = 37) than in the control group (n = 27), suggesting a Hawthorne effect. The small number of adverse drug events detected overall points to a low sensitivity of the detection method used. We recommend that future studies be designed differently, including a stronger focus on physician-pharmacist collaboration, patient participation and improved communication between the hospital and general practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1046,35139035,"Healthcare workers' perception of gender and work roles during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods study. OBJECTIVES A high functioning healthcare workforce is a key priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine how work and mental health for healthcare workers changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a universal healthcare system, stratified by gender factors. DESIGN A mixed-methods study was employed. Phase 1 was an anonymous, internet-based survey (7 May-15 July 2020). Phase 2 was semistructured interviews offered to all respondents upon survey completion to describe how experiences may have differed by gender identity, roles and relations. SETTING National universal healthcare system (Canada). PARTICIPANTS 2058 Canadian healthcare worker survey respondents (87% women, 11% men, 1% transgender or Two-Spirit), including 783 health professionals, 673 allied health professionals, 557 health support staff. Of the 63 unique healthcare worker types reported, registered nurses (11.5%), physicians (9.9%) and pharmacists (4.5%) were most common. Forty-six healthcare workers were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Reported pandemic-induced changes to occupational leadership roles and responsibilities, household and caregiving responsibilities, and anxiety levels by gender identity. RESULTS Men (19.8%) were more likely to hold pandemic leadership roles compared with women (13.4%). Women (57.5%) were more likely to report increased domestic responsibilities than men (45%). Women and those with dependents under the age of 10 years reported the greatest levels of anxiety during the pandemic. Interviews with healthcare workers further revealed a perceived imbalance in leadership opportunities based on gender identity, a lack of workplace supports disproportionately affecting women and an increase in domestic responsibilities influenced by gender roles. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic response has important gendered effects on the healthcare workforce. Healthcare workers are central to effective pandemic control, highlighting an urgent need for a gender-transformative pandemic response strategy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1047,35139107,"Development of a computerized intervention to improve health literacy in older Hispanics with type 2 diabetes using a pharmacist supervised comprehensive medication management. OBJECTIVE The primary objective was to develop a computerized culturally adapted health literacy intervention for older Hispanics with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Secondary objectives were to assess the usability and acceptability of the intervention by older Hispanics with T2D and clinical pharmacists providing comprehensive medication management (CMM). MATERIALS AND METHODS The study occurred in three phases. During phase I, an integration approach (i.e., quantitative assessments, qualitative interviews) was used to develop the intervention and ensure cultural suitability. In phase II, the intervention was translated to Spanish and modified based on data obtained in phase I. During phase III, the intervention was tested for usability/acceptability. RESULTS Thirty participants (25 older Hispanics with T2D, 5 clinical pharmacists) were included in the study. Five major themes emerged from qualitative interviews and were included in the intervention: 1) financial considerations, 2) polypharmacy, 3) social/family support, 4) access to medication/information, and 5) loneliness/sadness. Participants felt the computerized intervention developed was easy to use, culturally appropriate, and relevant to their needs. Pharmacists agreed the computerized intervention streamlined patient counseling, offered a tailored approach when conducting CMM, and could save them time. CONCLUSION The ability to offer individualized patient counseling based on information gathered from the computerized intervention allows for precision counseling. Future studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of the developed computerized intervention on adherence and health outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1049,35139838,"Intervention by a clinical pharmacist carried out at discharge of elderly patients admitted to the internal medicine department: influence on readmissions and costs. BACKGROUND Patient education on pharmacological treatment could reduce readmissions. Our objective was to carry out a pharmacist intervention focused on providing information about high-risk medications to chronic patients and to analyse its influence on readmissions and costs. METHODS A single-centre study with an intervention group and a retrospective control group was conducted. The intervention was carried out in all polymedicated patients ≥ 65 years who were admitted to internal medicine and signed the informed consent between June 2017 and February 2018. Patients discharged to nursing homes or long-term hospitals were excluded. The control group were all the patients who were admitted during the same months of 2014 who met the same inclusion criteria. The patients were classified according to the HOSPITAL score as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of potentially avoidable readmission. Outcome measures were 30-day readmission and cost data. To analyse the effect of the intervention on readmission, a logistic regression was performed. RESULTS The study included 589 patients (286 intervention group; 303 control group). The readmission rate decreased from 20.13% to 16.43% in the intervention group [OR = 0.760 95% CI (0.495-1.166); p = 0.209)]. The incremental cost for the intervention to prevent one readmission was €3,091.19, and the net cost saving was €1,301.26. In the intermediate- and high-risk groups, readmissions were reduced 10.91% and 10.00%, and the net cost savings were €3,3143.15 and €3,248.71, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist intervention achieved savings in the number of readmissions, and the net cost savings were greater in patients with intermediate and high risks of potentially avoidable readmission according to the HOSPITAL score.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Geriatric,,,,Inpatient,
1050,35140146,"Person-centred care provided by a multidisciplinary primary care team to improve therapeutic adequacy in polymedicated elderly patients (PCMR): randomised controlled trial protocol. INTRODUCTION The increase in elderly population has led to an associated increase in multiple pathologies, frailty, polypharmacy, healthcare costs, decreased quality of life and mortality. We designed an intervention based on person-centred care model. This article outlines a study protocol, which aims to explore the effects of the intervention to improve therapeutic adequacy in polymedicated elderly patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An open, randomised, multicentre, controlled clinical trial. The study population includes polymedicated (≥8 prescription medications) patients ≥75 years old. In the intervention group, the multidisciplinary team (primary care pharmacist, family doctor and nurse) will meet to carry out multidimensional reviews (frailty, clinical complexity, morbidity and therapeutic adequacy) of the study subjects. If changes are proposed to the treatment plan, a clinical interview will be conducted with the patient to agree on changes in accordance with their preferences. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 and 12 months. In the control group, where the usual clinical practice will be followed, the necessary data will be collected to compare the results.The key variables are the variation in the mean number of incidents (potentially inappropriate prescription) per patient, the number of medications, the number of changes implemented to the treatment plan and the variation in the number of hospital admissions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IDIAPJGol and by the University of Barcelona's Bioethics Commission. The results are expected to be published in peer reviewed open-access journals, and as part of a doctoral thesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT04188470. Pre-results.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1052,35141723,"A Continuing Education Activity Durably Addressed Knowledge Gaps Related to Penicillin Allergies Among Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians.  Background: Penicillin allergy is one of the most frequent self-reported allergies; however, only about 10% of reported allergies are accurate. Objectives: Through the creation of a continuing pharmacy education (CPE) activity, we sought to assess knowledge gaps and comfort levels in the management of penicillin allergies. Methods: A 1-hour enduring-content CPE activity was offered as an interactive course from September 20, 2019, to September 20, 2020. Participants completed 3 surveys (pre-survey, post-survey, and follow-up survey). Participants were pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who completed, at a minimum, the activity and both pre- and post-surveys. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants scoring >80% on knowledge-based questions on the post-survey compared with the pre-survey. Secondary outcomes included pre-post comparisons on knowledge-based questions, participants' self-report of an allergy, and comfort levels dispensing cephalosporins in a patient with a self-reported penicillin allergy. Results: A total of 389 participants completed the CPE activity, with 176 included for analysis. Significantly more participants scored >80% on knowledge-based questions on the post-survey compared with the pre-survey (71.6% vs 22.7%, P < .001). There was no significant difference between the percentage of participants scoring >80% on the post-survey and the follow-up survey (71.6% vs 65%, P = .119). The majority of participants (74%) felt comfortable dispensing a cephalosporin in a patient with a penicillin allergy on the pre-survey, with similar percentages on the post- and follow-up surveys (77% and 90%, respectively). Conclusion: A targeted continuing education program improved overall knowledge, which was sustained for up to 2 months.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: A reduction of 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly decreases the risk of major cardiovascular disease events. Pharmacists' management of blood pressure may assist with this reduction. Objective: Assess the impact of pharmacist management of hypertension via a collaborative practice agreement with physicians in an ambulatory care clinic. Methods: The first phase of this study was a retrospective chart review of physician/nurse hypertension visits from October 2019 to August 2020. The second prospective phase consisted of pharmacist managed hypertension visits from December 2020 to January 2021. The primary outcome was the change in SBP from the beginning to the end of the study period in the prospective group. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving their blood pressure goal and the proportion of patients adherent to all antihypertensive medications at their follow-up visits in both groups. This study was institutional review board approved. Results: Forty-seven patients were included and analyzed (24 in the retrospective group and 23 in the prospective group). Patients in the prospective group had an average SBP lowering of 10.83 mm Hg (P = .0035). Thirteen patients (56.5%) met their blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg in the prospective group, compared to 5 patients (20.8%) in the retrospective group (P = .012).

1054,35141726,"Media Generation and Pharmacy Regulatory Authority Awareness.  Background: Professional regulatory authorities play a critical role in protecting public interest. Yet, there is a growing view that trust in regulatory authorities may be on the decline. Objective: Awareness has been identified as important for maintaining trust. However, research that examines public awareness and trust in pharmacy regulatory authorities (PRAs) is lacking. This research explores public awareness and trust of PRAs and presents recommendations to enhance PRA communication strategies. Methods: An online survey was conducted with the Nova Scotia (Canada) public in 2020. Adopting classifications from the Communications literature, 3 media generations were explored: newspaper, television, and the Internet. The χ2 test of independence and Kruskal-Wallis H test were adopted to explore differences between the generations. Results: Six hundred sixty-two usable surveys were obtained. Over 80% of those surveyed were aware of the existence of the PRA. Those who had heard of the PRA were most aware of its operational responsibilities and less aware of its governance. The Internet Generation was more aware that the PRA includes members of the public in its decision making than expected and showed increased trust toward the PRA versus the other media generations. Conclusion: The findings should help inform PRA communication plans and set baselines to assess whether such plans enhance awareness. Future studies should explore additional aspects of PRA awareness and trust, perform comparisons across pharmacy jurisdictions, and develop and test models of the relationship between PRA awareness and various dimensions of institutional trust.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1055,35142014,"Perceptions of patients and healthcare providers on patient education to improve oral anticoagulant management. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Education of patients is thought to be key to high-quality oral anticoagulant (OAC) medication management. Theoretically, improving patients' knowledge should improve their self-management skills and adherence. The study's objective was to explore the opinions of healthcare providers and patients on the desired content and format of patient education on OACs, in addition to perceived barriers to high-quality patient education. METHODS We applied qualitative descriptive methods in a focus group study on OAC management. Five focus group discussions were conducted in two health regions in Southwestern Ontario from 2017 to 2018 with 19 patients, 7 caregivers and 16 healthcare providers (physicians, nurses and pharmacists). During the focus groups, participants discussed their experiences with OAC education and made suggestions about the content and format for patient education on OACs. Transcripts were analysed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS We identified the five themes of patient education on OAC management: content of OAC education (rationale, risk and appropriate drug administration methods), the best times for providing OAC education (time of OACs initiation along with continuing education), preferred education delivery strategies (case management targeted patient information summaries from authoritative sources such as Thrombosis Canada and video education), patient and community pharmacist engagement in OAC education, and perceived barriers to optimal patient education (patients depending too much on their healthcare providers for advice, the limited time patients spend with healthcare providers, gaps in clear communication between providers and the lack of a nationally or provincially coordinated OAC management programme). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that patients, caregivers and healthcare providers support the need for education on OACs, including for patients taking DOACs. Specific important content and proper education format are needed. The optimal combination of content, format, duration, timing and sources for OAC education requires further research.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1056,35144864,"Using the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process to address social determinants of health in patients with diabetes.  Owing to the accessibility of pharmacists and frequency of their patient encounters, pharmacists may be in the unique position to help recognize the impact that social determinants of health (SDOH) have on a patient's health. The American Pharmacists Association wants to provide practical tools and resources for pharmacists to assess and mitigate SDOH with their patients. Through the use of a diabetes patient case and the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP), this article will highlight a few of the numerous items available to provide culturally and linguistically tailored disease management and health literate and numerate communication and to improve food security. Using tools and resources to address SDOH in the context of the PPCP allows pharmacists to develop an even more patient- and person-centered care plan with the goal of achieving optimal patient outcomes and reducing health disparities.

1057,35145044,"Improvement in Medication Adherence after Pharmacist Intervention Is Associated with Favorable Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis. Background/Aims Although pharmacist intervention for patients with chronic diseases has been shown to improve medication adherence, few studies have evaluated its effects on the objective clinical outcomes. We investigated the impact of pharmacist intervention on medication adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods Patients with UC and low medication adherence were divided into two groups, based on pharmacist intervention. Their medication possession ratio and nonadherence rate for 6 months before and after the baseline were investigated. The partial Mayo score, flare-up incidence, and factors influencing flare-up events for 1 year after the baseline were analyzed. Results Of 99 patients, 33 and 66 were included in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The nonadherence rate significantly declined in the intervention group 6 months after the baseline (60.6% before vs 30.3% after; p=0.013). The groups showed a significant difference regarding time-related partial Mayo scores (p=0.002). Intervention was significantly negatively correlated with time and the partial Mayo score (r2=0.035, p=0.013). A significant difference was observed in the flare-up incidence (33.3% in the intervention group vs 54.6% in the control group; p=0.046). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that pharmacist intervention (adjusted odds ratio, 0.370; 95% confidence interval, 0.145 to 0.945; p=0.038) independently reduced the flareup risk. Conclusions Pharmacist intervention significantly decreased the nonadherence rate, improved the partial Mayo score, and reduced the flare-up incidence compared with the control group in a cohort of UC patients identified to have low medication adherence.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
1058,35145341,"Utilization of drug information resources among community pharmacists in Jordan: A cross-sectional study. Background Pharmacists are considered to be important sources of drug information (DI) for patients and other healthcare providers. This study aims to examine the characteristics of DI utilization for practicing pharmacists in Jordan and identify the main barriers that impede their ability to utilize them. Method A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between the 27th of November 2020 and 18th of January 2021. Our questionnaire was constructed to explore pharmacists' utilization patterns of DI resources, the types of DI resources they use and barriers impeding them. Results A total of 1875 pharmacists participated in this study. Only one-fifth of the participating pharmacists reported that they referred to DI databases. The most commonly reported databases/websites were Drugs.com, Jordan FDA, and Medscape. The most commonly reported paper-based resources were Drugs in Jordan, Step up pharmacy, and British Pharmacopeia. The most commonly used mobile applications were Drugs.com, Medscape and Lexicomp. 44% of the pharmacists reported that they use DI resources fewer than five times per week and more than half of them (60.7%, n = 1138) reported that the day-shift was the shift that allowed them more time to use DI resources. Lack of time was the most common barrier (53.2%) that restricted the ability of pharmacists to use DI resources. Conclusion Using electronic resources is still deficient and far from optimum and interventions to improve the pharmacists' utilization of electronic drug databases are required. Universities and various pharmaceutical bodies are advised to train pharmacists on using DI databases.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1059,35145346,"Characteristics of the ideal clinical pharmacy residency candidate: A survey of residency program directors and preceptors in Saudi Arabia. Objective Residency positions are highly competitive. Pharmacy students who are familiar with the ideal qualities of residency candidates and the expectations of residency programs may be more likely to obtain one of these coveted positions. This study identifies the characteristics that residency program directors (RPDs) and preceptors use to define an ideal residency candidate. Methods This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study that surveyed pharmacy RPDs and preceptors across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The questionnaires are comprised of two sections: demographic information and characteristics of the residency candidates. Over a five-month period (May 1, 2020 - September 30, 2020), the survey was sent electronically to the participants. Results Of the 78 surveys returned, 68 surveys were included (RPDs: 36, Preceptors: 32) and 12 surveys (15.17%) were excluded due to incompleteness. Number of RPDs responded to the survey represents (65%) of the total RPDs in Saudi Arabia. The mean response scores from the results of the Likert scale [strongly agree (1) - strongly disagree (5)] - suggest that a candidate's performance during the interview (mean score = 1.5), their professional appearance (1.5), an alignment between a candidate's interests and the program focus (1.6), and previous hospital experience (1.8) mattered most. While being from the same region (3.4), having an advanced degree (2.8) and the cumulative Grade Point Average (2.7) mattered the least. We find that previous hospital experience (29%), familiarity with the program (16%), research experience (15%), Saudi Commission for Health Specialists aggregate score (10%), and letters of recommendation (4%) are considered the top five factors. Conclusion Residency candidates should focus on training in clinical settings. Offering mock interviews and Saudi Pharmacist Licensure Examination practice tests and involving pharmacy students in clinical research may increase their chance in securing a residency position.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1060,35145559,"Exploration of the Mechanism of Lianhua Qingwen in Treating Influenza Virus Pneumonia and New Coronavirus Pneumonia with the Concept of ""Different Diseases with the Same Treatment"" Based on Network Pharmacology.  The 31 main components of Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) were obtained through a literature and database search; the components included glycyrrhizic acid, emodin, chlorogenic acid, isophoroside A, forsythia, menthol, luteolin, quercetin, and rutin. Sixty-eight common targets for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and influenza virus pneumonia (IVP) were also obtained. A ""component-target-disease"" network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.2.1 software, and 20 key targets, such as cyclooxygenase2 (COX2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), mitogen-activated protein kinase14 (Mapk14), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), were screened from the network. The David database was used to perform a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment. Results showed that the key targets of LHQW in the treatment of NCP and IVP mainly involved biological processes, such as immune system process intervention, cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion, toxic metabolism, cytokine activity, and regulation of the synthesis process. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that 115 signalling pathways were related to the treatment of LHQW. Amongst them, IL-17, T cell receptor, Th17 cell differentiation, TNF, toll-like receptor, MAPK, apoptosis, and seven other signalling pathways were closely related to the occurrence and development of NCP and IVP. Molecular docking showed that each component had different degrees of binding with six targets, namely, 3C-like protease (3CL), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), COX2, hemagglutinin (HA), IL-6, and neuraminidase (NA). Rutin, isoforsythiaside A, hesperidin and isochlorogenic acid B were the best components for docking with the six core targets. The first five components with the best docking results were isoforsythiaside, hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid B, forsythin E, and quercetin. In conclusion, LHQW has many components, targets, and pathways. The findings of this work can provide an important theoretical basis for determining the mechanism of LHQW in treating NCP and IVP.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1061,35145831,"Idiopathic Symptoms Resolved by Pharmacogenomics-Enriched Comprehensive Medication Management: A Case Report.  Clinical manifestations of biological aging can be remarkably similar to the side effects of frequently used medications. Fatigue, muscle pain, and confusion are common and often not shared as part of proper geriatric patient history. When patients report them, a root cause is usually confounding. These symptoms not only negatively impact health and wellness outcomes, patient quality of life, and increase costs to the healthcare system, but also may be a limitation on provider best practices. The patient, a 71-year-old female of European descent, enrolled in pharmacogenomics-enriched comprehensive medication management (PGx+CMM) program through her retirement benefit. At the time of testing, she was approximately 18 months post cerebrovascular accident and was being observed by her primary care provider for common chronic conditions. Of interest, she had been manifesting unreported clinical symptoms of fatigue, hypotension, and myalgia. Addressing these patient concerns and specifically focusing on an individual's goals, fears, and basic needs, rather than concentrating merely on the absence of disease, is the crux of personalized medicine and programs that address the notion of healthy aging. The patient's therapeutic regimen was adjusted based on PGx+CMM pharmacist review, use of a clinical decision support system (CDSS), and communication of recommendations to the prescribing physician. The patient saw rapid improvements in symptoms, suggesting they were caused by medication side effects. Her blood pressure and cholesterol levels remained controlled while noticeable side effects were eliminated. This case study demonstrates the positive impacts of personalized medicine and shows how pharmacists can be empowered with a CDSS to positively impact healthcare.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1062,35146001,"Investigating the Usability, Efficacy and Accuracy of a Medication Entering Software System for a Healthcare Robot.  Purpose: This research aimed to evaluate medication software for a healthcare robot. Study I compared two software versions (RoboGen and RoboGen2) for system usability, speed and accuracy of medication entry; Study II evaluated system usability and community pharmacists' views of RoboGen2. Methods: Study I had a within-subjects experimental design and recruited 40 Health Sciences students to enter different, comparable sets of prescriptions into the two systems, in randomized order, within a limit of 15 min. Screen activity was recorded to observe prescription errors. Study II had a cross-sectional observational design and recruited 20 community pharmacists using convenience sampling. Pharmacists entered three prescriptions using RoboGen2. Participants in both studies completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) following each task. Study I participants completed a questionnaire on system preference, and Study II participants a semi-structured interview. Results: Study I participants preferred Robogen2 (p < 0.001) due to its sleek and modern layout, good flow, ease of use, and intuitive design. SUS scores [t (40) = -3.40, p = 0.002] and speed of medication entry favored Robogen2 (t = 3.65, p < 0.001). No significance was found in accuracy (t = 1.12, p = 0.27). In study 2, pharmacists rated the usability of RoboGen2 below average. Themes from interviews were navigation and streamlining the system, ease of use, and integration with pharmacy software systems. Conclusion: Adding safety features and better aesthetics can improve the usability and safety of a medication prescription system. Streamlining workflow and pre-populating data can increase speed of prescription entry without compromising patient safety. However, a better approach is integration with pre-existing pharmacy systems to reduce workload while incorporating safety features built into existing dispensing systems.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibiotic use is often the target of interventions in health care organizations that aim to decrease healthcare-associated infections (HAI) such as Clostridioides difficile (CDI); this is particularly important for fluoroquinolones (FQ), which are frequently used in critical care settings. In this study, using a multiple case study research approach, we conduct an in-depth analysis of an intervention aimed at limiting ICU prescriber access to FQ in two ICUs of two hospitals. The data collection and analysis were guided by a human factors engineering approach based on the SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) model and evidence-based implementation principles. Our results show some differences in the implementation of the FQ intervention between the two ICUs, such as level and method of FQ restriction, and training and communication with physicians and pharmacists. In both ICUs, several organizational learning mechanisms helped to quickly identify problems with the intervention and ensure that changes were made in a just-in-time manner (e.g. just-in-time training, removal of FQ in order set for pneumonia).

A total of 42 articles were eligible and were included in the review. These studies included a total of 4326 COVID-19 patients. The 30-day mortality was found to be associated with increased cardiac troponin and myocardial infarction could be a systemic reaction rather than the direct action of COVID-19. Patients with myocardial injury were significantly older and with co-morbid conditions. Studies also found a correlation of higher concentrations of cardiac enzymes with disease severity and increased in-hospital mortality.

Background Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is a key factor increasing antimicrobial resistance, a major global public health problem including in South Africa. Key drivers include antibiotics being dispensed without a prescription. Objectives To determine the accessibility of antibiotics without a prescription in community pharmacies in urban areas in South Africa and determine whether counselling was provided when antibiotics were dispensed. Patients and methods Prospective, observational study, employing simulated patients (SPs), presenting with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), undertaken to establish whether antibiotics can be obtained without a valid prescription in South Africa. This pilot study was conducted in privately owned (n = 20) and corporate (franchised, n = 14) community pharmacies in three regions in Gauteng Province. Results Antibiotics were sold in privately owned pharmacies without a prescription in 80% (16/20) of cases while no antibiotics were dispensed in corporate (franchised) pharmacies. Of the 16 pharmacies selling antibiotics without a prescription, pharmacist assistants were involved in 37.5% (n = 6) and counselling was not provided to 19% of SPs. Ciprofloxacin (42.9%) and metronidazole (28.6%) were the most common antibiotics dispensed. No antibiotics were dispensed for URTIs, only UTIs. Conclusions Dispensing antibiotics without prescriptions can be common among privately owned pharmacies in urban areas in South Africa. Corporate pharmacies, which probably have a greater income, appear to follow current legislation banning such activities. To limit selling with no prescription, community pharmacists and assistants especially in urban areas should be educated on appropriate patient care and legal requirements, with dispensing electronically monitored.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Voriconazole is a widely used antifungal agent in immunocompromised patients, but its utility is limited by its variable exposure and narrow therapeutic index. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been used to characterize voriconazole PK and derive individualized dosing regimens. However, determinants of temporal within-patient variability of voriconazole PK were not well established. We aimed to characterize temporal variability of voriconazole PK within individuals and identify predictive clinical factors. This study was conducted as a part of a single-institution, phase I study of intravenous voriconazole in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (NCT02227797). We analyzed voriconazole PK study data collected at week 1 and again at week 2 after the start of voriconazole therapy in 59 pediatric patients undergoing HCT (age <21 years). Population PK analysis using nonlinear mixed effect modeling was performed to analyze temporal within-individual variability of voriconazole PK by incorporating a between-occasion variability term in the model. A 2-compartment linear elimination model incorporating body weight and cytochrome P450 2C19 phenotype described the data. The ratio of individual voriconazole clearance between weeks 1 and 2 ranged from 0.11 to 3.3 (-9.1 to +3.3-fold change). Incorporation of covariate effects by serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels decreased between-occasion variability of clearance as compared to the model without them (coefficient of variation, 41.2% and 59.5%, respectively) and improved the model fit (P < .05).

OBJECTIVE To present process evaluation results from the Bridge-it Study, a pragmatic cluster randomised cross-over trial to improve effective contraception uptake through provision of the progestogen only pill (POP) plus sexual and reproductive health (SRH) clinic rapid-access to women presenting to community pharmacies for emergency contraception (EC). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A multimethod process evaluation was conducted to assess intervention implementation, mechanisms of change and contextual factors. Data were gathered from screening logs (n=599), observations of pharmacist training, analysis of data from 4-month follow-up questionnaires (n=406), monitoring of contemporaneous events and qualitative interviews with 22 pharmacists, 5 SRH clinical staff and 36 study participants in three participating UK sites in Lothian, Tayside and London. RESULTS The intervention was largely delivered as intended and was acceptable. Pharmacists', SRH clinical staff and participants' accounts highlighted that providing a supply of POP with EC from the pharmacy as routine practice may have positive impacts on contraceptive practices in the short term, and potentially longer term. Key mechanisms of change included ease of access, increased awareness of contraception and services, and greater motivation and perceptions of self-efficacy. Few participants took up the offer to attend an SRH service (rapid-access component), and existing barriers within the SRH context were apparent (eg, lack of staff). Participant accounts highlight persistent barriers to accessing and using routine effective contraception remain. CONCLUSIONS Implementation appeared to be acceptable and feasible, highlighting the potential for provision of POP within EC consultations as routine practice in community pharmacies. However, lack of engagement with the rapid access component of the intervention and existing barriers within the SRH context suggest that signposting to SRH services may be sufficient. Wider implementation should consider ways to address key implementation challenges to increase effectiveness and sustainability, and to overcome persistent barriers to accessing and using effective contraception.

OBJECTIVES To describe a pharmacist-led campaign aimed at reducing the proportion of people with HIV with ongoing chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and delineating barriers to HCV care in this patient population. METHODS An electronic report and retrospective chart review were used to identify patients who remained with HCV infections after a previous treatment initiative. A clinical pharmacist and pharmacy resident approached the remaining HCV patients during their routine visits for HIV care to offer and coordinate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. The primary end-point was to compare the prevalence of chronic HCV before and after the intervention period. Barriers to care were also evaluated, with logistic regression performed to identify predictors of sustained virologic response (SVR) attainment. RESULTS Forty-six patients were included in the analysis (4.2% of clinic population), with HCV prevalence falling to 0.6% (six patients) by the end of the study (p < 0.0001). The HCV care cascade in the cohort was as follows: 70% agreed to and received DAA therapy, 63% initiated therapy, and 50% achieved SVR. The top barriers to care at baseline included recreational drug use (67%), poor engagement in care (61%), and mental health disorders (28%). Poor engagement in care and active recreational drug use were associated with decreased odds of achieving SVR in bivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS A coordinated effort can make strides towards reducing the overall burden of HCV in this challenging population. The HCV care cascade remains tied to the HIV continuum of care, with poor engagement in care remaining an important rate-limiting step impeding micro-elimination.",0,0,1,1,1,Reviewer 1 did not see that this was a pharmacist intervention study.,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Ambulatory,

1072,35151024,"Exploring perspectives on changing opioid prescribing practices: A qualitative study of community stakeholders in the HEALing Communities Study. BACKGROUND Community-based perspectives are needed to more broadly inform policy-makers, public health practitioners, prescribers, and pharmacists about community-led and broader efforts to reduce opioid overprescribing, and ultimately reduce prescription opioid use disorder, overdoses and fatalities. The aim of this study is to explore community-based perspectives on efforts to change opioid prescribing practices in their communities. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 388 community stakeholders across four states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio) from November 2019 to January 2020 about community approaches and goals of community-led responses to the opioid crisis. Data analysis combined deductive and inductive approaches to identify themes and sub-themes related to improving opioid prescribing practices. RESULTS Three major themes and different subthemes were characterized: (1) acknowledging progress (i.e., healthcare providers being part of the solution, provider education, and prescription drug monitoring programs); (2) emergent challenges (i.e., physician nonadherence with safer opioid prescribing guidelines, difficulty identifying appropriate use of opioids, and concerns about accelerating the progression from opioid misuse to drug abuse); and (3) opportunities for change (i.e., educating patients about safer use and proper disposal of opioids, expanding prescriber and pharmacist education, changing unrealistic expectations around eliminating pain, expanding and increasing insurance coverage for alternative treatment options). CONCLUSIONS Community stakeholders appeared to support specific opportunities to reduce prescription opioid misuse and improve safer prescribing. The opportunities included culture change around pain expectations, awareness of safe disposal, additional provider education, and increased coverage and acceptability of non-opioid treatments.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1073,35151310,"A qualitative dual-site analysis of the pharmacist discharge care (PHARM-DC) intervention using the CFIR framework. INTRODUCTION Older adults face several challenges when transitioning from acute hospitals to community-based care. The PHARMacist Discharge Care (PHARM-DC) intervention is a pharmacist-led Transitions of Care (TOC) program intended to reduce 30-day hospital readmissions and emergency department visits at two large hospitals. This study used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework to evaluate pharmacist perceptions of the PHARM-DC intervention. METHODS Intervention pharmacists and pharmacy administrators were purposively recruited by study team members located within each participating institution. Study team members located within each institution coordinated with two study authors unaffiliated with the institutions implementing the intervention to conduct interviews and focus groups remotely via telecommunication software. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, with transcriptions imported into NVivo for qualitative analysis. Qualitative analysis was performed using an iterative process to identify ""a priori"" constructs based on CFIR domains (intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the individuals involved, and the process of implementation) and to create overarching themes as identified during coding. RESULTS In total, ten semi-structured interviews and one focus group were completed across both hospitals. At Site A, six interviews were conducted with intervention pharmacists and pharmacists in administrative roles. Also at Site A, one focus group comprised of five intervention pharmacists was conducted. At Site B, interviews were conducted with four intervention pharmacists and pharmacists in administrative roles. Three overarching themes were identified: PHARM-DC and Institutional Context, Importance of PHARM-DC Adaptability, and Recommendations for PHARM-DC Improvement and Sustainability. Increasing pharmacist support for technical tasks and navigating pharmacist-patient language barriers were important to intervention implementation and delivery. Identifying cost-savings and quantifying outcomes as a result of the intervention were particularly important when considering how to sustain and expand the PHARM-DC intervention. CONCLUSION The PHARM-DC intervention can successfully be implemented at two institutions with considerable variations in TOC initiatives, resources, and staffing. Future implementation of PHARM-DC interventions should consider the themes identified, including an examination of institution-specific contextual factors such as the roles that pharmacy technicians may play in TOC interventions, the importance of intervention adaptability to account for patient needs and institutional resources, and pharmacist recommendations for intervention improvement and sustainability.

1074,35151315,"Predictors of loss due to pharmaceutical fraud: evidence from the U.S. BACKGROUND Globally and in the U.S. in particular, pharmaceutical fraud account for a large number out of all crimes in health care, which result into severe costs to the society. The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacists (Fraud, waste, and abuse in prescription drug benefits. 2019. Posted May 20. https://www.amcp.org/policy-advocacy/policy-advocacy-focus-areas/where-we-stand-position-statements/fraud-waste-and-abuse-prescription-drug-benefits .) estimate that pharmacy fraud is 1% of costs, therefore estimating that pharmacy fraud costs at $3.5 billion, given that pharmacy costs are $358 billion (Statista. Prescription drug expenditure in the United States from 1960 to 2020. 2021. https://www.statista.com/statistics/184914/prescription-drug-expenditures-in-the-us-since-1960/ ). AIM This exploratory study aims to demonstrate a fraudster's profile as well as to estimate average consequences in terms of costs and identify the loss predictors' hierarchy in the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from the Corporate Prosecution Registry and mixed-effects models are utilized for this purpose. The dataset covers years 2001-2020 and 75 cases, falling into one of the following broad sub-categories: misbranding, counterfeit, off-label use of drugs/deceptive marketing; violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. RESULTS The main factors positively associated with loss due to pharmaceutical fraud are: (i) duration of , and (ii) the scheme and scheme being executed at a U.S. public company. Surprisingly, presence of collusion negatively and significantly effects the cost. Potential factors include: (a) principal perpetrator being a white American and/or male, and (b) number of employees at individual and organizational level respectively. CONCLUSION This study empirically justifies considering loss, due to pharmaceutical fraud, from a multi-level perspective. Identified profiles of a typical fraudster helped to elaborate on specific practical recommendations aimed at pharmaceutical fraud prevention in the U.S.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3 discussants for this JCL Roundtable are National Lipid Association leaders representing essential areas on the team - Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, Advanced Practice Provider, and Clinical Pharmacist. The team approach has been shown more effective than traditional sole provider management for controlling chronic asymptomatic conditions like hypercholesterolemia. Teams also fit better as health care transitions away from fee-for-service into value-based reimbursement. It's worth noting that medicine and even surgery were never entirely solo endeavors. Here we discuss a more expansive team model, which began in the U.S. more than 2 decades ago in the Veterans Administration and certain managed care organizations such as Kaiser Permanente. These health care organizations place themselves at risk, comprising both normative and financial risk, for maintaining their patients' health. Academic medical centers and private health care groups increasingly are adopting the at-risk model and medical teams. Electronic health records facilitate the transition. Team members include not only licensed professionals like our discussants, but also medical assistants, front desk staff, and schedulers. All share decision making and responsibility. Ideally the patient becomes the central member, not merely the focal point, of the team.

1076,35151583,"Impact of pharmacist outreach on glucagon prescribing. BACKGROUND Hypoglycemia is a major limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes. As a method of treating hypoglycemia, the American Diabetes Association recommends glucagon to be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of clinically impactful hypoglycemia. Glucagon Emergency Kits have been shown to reduce emergency department visits and overall health care costs. Despite these known benefits, glucagon continues to be underprescribed. Previous pharmacist-led interventions embedded in a single clinic have been shown to positively affect the rate of glucagon prescribing in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare the rate of glucagon prescribing between quality improvement remote pharmacist outreach to multiple primary care and endocrinology specialty clinics and the control group in 1 month following a pharmacist-led provider outreach. METHODS This was a single-center, 2-arm study with a simple randomization design. RESULTS On pharmacist outreach, 61 of 109 patients (56.0%) in the outreach group were prescribed a glucagon product within 1 month of their primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinology appointment compared with 1 of 113 (0.9%) of patients in the control group (P < 0.001). Glucagon prescribing occurred in 25 of 35 black patients (71.4%) compared with 36 of 73 white patients (49.3%) in the outreach group. Glucagon prescribing was associated with race (P = 0.03; chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist-led provider outreach before a PCP or endocrinology appointment has a positive and statistically significant impact on glucagon prescribing rates.

In this context the health institutions are looking for improving prevention and so realize how well-placed pharmacists were. For their competences as well as the trust patients are giving, they are serious actors in the implementation of prevention. METHODS We sought to understand which place pharmacists take in prevention policies. Thus, we have proceeded with an analysis of bibliography of the past ten years about articles registered in Medline talking about pharmacist's places in French prevention. RESULTS We have selected 47 articles classified according to San Marco's 3 levels of prevention: universal, oriented or targeted prevention. The pharmacist is involved in universal prevention, cancer screening or the proper use of antibiotics. In targeted prevention, they are specifically interested in the proper use of medicines and their correct prescription to patients. Finally, for targeted prevention, they offer patients therapeutic education adapted to their needs. CONCLUSIONS We can highlight that pharmacists improve consequently the patient's quality of life. They also enhance connections between health care professionals. Thanks to pharmacists, patients can find easy access and reliable health advice and government, trustworthy support for prevention.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This review aimed to critically evaluate the impact of pharmacist involvement in managing pain in cancer patients. Databases (including MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL) were searched with a broad search strategy for studies involving pharmacists and cancer pain management until February 10, 2021. The quality of studies and evidence were assessed using standardised tools and GRADE, respectively. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. Sixty-four studies were included. Common interventions delivered by the pharmacists were medication review, patient education, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) detection and management, pharmacological recommendations (in dosing and pharmacotherapy choice), and pain assessment. A pooled analysis of three randomised control trials showed a significant reduction in pain intensity with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.35 [95% confidence intervals (CI): -0.55, -0.16]. Pooled analyses from non-randomised studies of interventions also showed significant results in reducing ADRs with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.79) and improvement in quality of life with SMD of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.29, 1.32).

1079,35152426,"Predictors of prior unsuccessful pharmacy abortion attempts among women presenting for abortion in government certified clinics in Nepal. OBJECTIVE Although abortion in Nepal is broadly legal and free of charge, many women seek abortion care outside the legal system, including from pharmacies. We evaluated the prevalence of, and factors associated with, prior unsuccessful abortion attempts among women presenting to 14 randomly-selected government approved abortion health facilities across Nepal. METHODS Eligible participants were recruited in 2019 by trained research staff from certified abortion facilities. Participants (n=1,160) completed research staff-administered baseline surveys. We used multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with having attempted pharmacy abortion prior to coming to the health facility. RESULTS Almost one in seven (14%) of women had tried to end their pregnancy before presenting to a participating clinic, often (9%) using medication obtained from a pharmacy. Women who lived farther from the clinic (aOR 1.28 per log hours travel time, 95% CI 1.10-1.49) and who reported financial difficulty in accessing the clinic (19% vs. 10%, aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.20-3.70) had increased odds of having tried to access abortion through a pharmacy.

BACKGROUND Anticoagulation clinics faced an unprecedented challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic to safely manage patients on warfarin therapy. METHODS A London teaching hospital trust received INR point-of-care (POC) testing devices from its clinical commissioning group. The Trust distributed the devices to patients who were cognitively and physically able to self-test and evaluated clinical outcomes and patient experience. FINDINGS A significant improvement in warfarin control (mean time in therapeutic range (TTR) before POC 52%, standard deviation (SD) 24.8, vs mean after 60.7%, SD 19.7; P>0.009) and a 39% reduction in missed appointments were seen in self-testing patients. Positive patient satisfaction and lifestyle outcomes were identified through a telephone survey. A minority of patients struggled with the technique, leading to frustration. Some patients used many test strips through unsuccessful and additional tests. CONCLUSION POC testing in a carefully selected group of patients on warfarin therapy resulted in positive clinical and patient satisfaction outcomes.

BACKGROUND In many countries, pharmacists' scope of practice enables the delivery of professional pharmacy services related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Studies exploring practices and perspectives regarding a wide range of SRH professional pharmacy services and the extent to which pharmacists are involved in prescribing or administering injections are limited. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to explore SRH professional pharmacy services provided by pharmacists, evaluate pharmacists' self-reported confidence in providing SRH education and determine preferences for additional training. METHODS A cross-sectional Web-based survey was administered to pharmacists working in community pharmacies in Alberta, Canada. The survey was sent via e-mail and was open for 8 weeks between June and August 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Most of the 303 participants were female (66%) and received their first pharmacy degree in Canada (69%). Approximately two-thirds had additional prescribing authorization (APA), and 97% had injections authorization; 90% and 94% of participants reported administering injectable contraceptives and human papillomavirus vaccine, respectively, and more than 95% renewed prescriptions for oral contraceptives. Of the participants with APA, approximately 40% reported providing initial prescribing services for contraceptive products. Overall, participants reported confidence in providing SRH education for most topics. Most selected topics for additional training were related to sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections; sexual health concerns of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning; and abortion medications.

Background Contemporary information regarding fever and neutropenia (FN) management, including approaches to antibacterial prophylaxis, empiric therapy, and de-escalation across US cancer centers, is lacking. Methods This was a self-administered, electronic, cross-sectional survey of antimicrobial stewardship physicians and pharmacists at US cancer centers. The survey ascertained institutional practices and individual attitudes on FN management in high-risk cancer patients. A 5-point Likert scale assessed individual attitudes. Results Providers from 31 of 86 hospitals (36%) responded, and FN management guidelines existed in most (29/31, 94%) hospitals. Antibacterial prophylaxis was recommended in 27/31 (87%) hospitals, with levofloxacin as the preferred agent (23/27, 85%). Cefepime was the most recommended agent for empiric FN treatment (26/29, 90%). Most institutional guidelines (26/29, 90%) recommended against routine addition of empiric gram-positive agents except for specific scenarios. Eighteen of 29 (62%) hospitals explicitly provided guidance on de-escalation of empiric, systemic antibacterial therapy; however, timing of de-escalation was variable according to clinical scenario. Among 34 individual respondents, a majority agreed with use of antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk patients (25, 74%). Interestingly, only 10 (29%) respondents indicated agreement with the statement that benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh potential harms. Conclusion Most US cancer centers surveyed had institutional FN management guidelines. Antibiotic de-escalation guidance was lacking in nearly 40% of centers, with heterogeneity in approaches when recommendations existed.

1084,35156030,"Survey of infectious diseases providers reveals variability in duration of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of Gram-negative bloodstream infections. Background Trials supporting shorter durations of antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bloodstream infections (GN-BSI) have recently been published. However, adoption of these findings into practice is unclear given limited eligibility criteria and relatively large non-inferiority margins of these studies. To better understand contemporary management of GN-BSI, we conducted an international survey of infectious diseases (ID) specialists. Methods We developed and disseminated an online survey to assess practice patterns involving treatment duration of GN-BSI, including providers from 28 countries. χ2 tests, t-tests and multivariable linear regression with generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with treatment duration. Results In total, 277 ID specialists completed the survey (64% physicians, 31% pharmacists). The median reported duration of antibiotics was 7 days (IQR, 7-10 days) for all GN-BSI sources. Thirty percent of providers typically recommend durations that differ by ≥7 days depending on the source of GN-BSI, and 71% treat ≥10 days for at least one source. In an adjusted model, factors associated with increased duration included intra-abdominal (+1.01 days, 95% CI 0.57-1.45 days; P < 0.0001), vascular catheter (+0.74 days; 0.33-1.15 days; P = 0.0004), and respiratory (+0.76 days; 0.38-1.14 days; P < 0.0001) sources of GN-BSI relative to urinary sources. Providers that transition patients to oral therapy report shorter durations than those who treat with full IV therapy (-0.60 days; -1.12 to -0.09 days; P = 0.02).

PURPOSE To describe and compare self-reported medication adherence assessed with the 5-item version of Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) and pharmacy refill adherence based on data from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (SPDR) among persons with ischemic stroke, and to investigate independent predictors associated with respective assessments. METHODS A study questionnaire was sent to persons with ischemic stroke registered in the Swedish Stroke Register between Dec 2011 and March 2012, and who lived at home 3 months after discharge. The primary outcome was dichotomized to adherent/non-adherent based on MARS-5 and SPDR and analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Adherence according to MARS-5 was defined as score 23 or higher (out of 25). Adherence according to SPDR was defined as at least one filled statin prescription recorded in SPDR in each 6-month interval during 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS Of 420 participants, 367 (87%) and 329 (78%) were adherent according to MARS-5 and SPDR, respectively, and 294 (70%) participants were adherent according to both assessments. A significant association was shown between medication adherence according to the two assessments (p = 0.020).

We describe the rationale for each recommendation and the potential ways that an expanded CARE Act could reduce the risks associated with transitions in care for aging patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1088,35156937,"Accessibility of Low-cost Insulin From Illegitimate Internet Pharmacies: Cross-sectional Study. BACKGROUND There is much public debate regarding the high cost of insulin. With 1-in-4 patients in the United States with type 1 diabetes reporting difficulties affording insulin, there is concern that some of these patients might look for cost savings on the internet, unaware that 96% of internet pharmacies are illegitimate. Patients who purchase insulin from illegitimate internet pharmacies remove themselves from traditional health care systems that ensure safe, quality-assured, and effective medication use. OBJECTIVE This study aims to determine the accessibility of Humalog and NovoLog insulin from internet pharmacies and characterize how these sites approached patient safety, and priced as well as marketed their products. METHODS From September to December 2019, we queried the phrases buy insulin online, buy Humalog online, and buy NovoLog online in common search engines. The first 100 search results from Google and Bing, and the first 50 search results from Yahoo! and DuckDuckGo were screened. Websites were included if they claimed to sell Humalog or NovoLog insulin, were active, free access, in the English language, and had a unique URL. The legitimacy of websites was classified using LegitScript. Safety and marketing characteristics were compared across the legitimacy of internet pharmacies. Internet pharmacy prices were compared with the prices offered through brick-and-mortar pharmacies using GoodRx. RESULTS We found that 59% (n=29) of the 49 internet pharmacies in our analysis were illegitimate, whereas only 14% (n=7) were legitimate and 27% (n=13) were unclassified. Across illegitimate internet pharmacies, Humalog and NovoLog insulin were 2 to 5 times cheaper as compared with both legitimate internet pharmacies and brick-and-mortar stores. Risks associated with the use of illegitimate internet pharmacies by American consumers were evident: 57% (8/14) did not require a prescription, 43% (6/14) did not display medication information or warnings, and only 21% (3/14) offered access to purported pharmacists. This included 9 rogue internet pharmacies that sold Humalog and NovoLog insulin within the United States, where 11% (1/9) required a prescription, 11% (1/9) placed quantity limits per purchase, and none offered pharmacist services. Rogue internet pharmacies often offered bulk discounts (11/18, 61%), assured privacy (14/18, 78%), and promoted other products alongside insulin (13/18, 72%). The marketing language of illegitimate internet pharmacies appealed more to quality, safety, and customer service as compared with legitimate sites. CONCLUSIONS The ease of access to low-cost insulin through illegitimate internet pharmacies calls for urgent attention. Illegitimate internet pharmacies place patients at risk of poor-quality medications and subpar pharmacy services, resulting in adverse events and poor diabetes control. A multifaceted approach is needed to close illegitimate internet pharmacies through legal and regulatory measures, develop better search engine filters, raise public awareness of the dangers of illegitimate internet pharmacies, and address the high costs of insulin.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS Majority of the subjects had knowledge and awareness about breast cancer, its risk factors, diagnostic parameters and possible treatment options, but they did not have knowledge regarding the procedures of breast self-examination.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1091,35158260,"Emergency medicine pharmacist interventions reducing exposure to costs (EMPIRE-C). INTRODUCTION Emergency Medicine (EM) pharmacists are considered essential healthcare providers in the Emergency Department (ED). Limited data are available representing the types of interventions performed by ED pharmacists, especially in community-based health systems. METHODS Retrospective, multi-centered, observational review of documented EM clinical pharmacist interventions into the electronic medical record (EMR) across five separate EDs between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. Interventions were separated into three categories: ED Intervention, ED Outpatient Culture Review, and ED Discharge Antimicrobial Review. Interventions with supporting literature related to cost avoidance were also analyzed. RESULTS A total of 23,794 interventions were logged by the EM pharmacy team between the three categories. Of those, 9181 were cost avoidance interventions resulting in $5,350,755.63 in total cost avoidance, or $582.81 per intervention. CONCLUSION EM pharmacists practicing in community settings have a substantial impact on patients as evidenced by the large quantity and variety of interventions logged which also results in significant cost avoidance to the healthcare system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1092,35158928,"Assessment of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in Outpatients Taking Oral Anticancer Drugs Included in the Real-Life Oncoral Program.  Background In previous studies, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been shown to improve survival in cancer patients. The aim of the present study was to assess symptoms potentially related to adverse events experienced by cancer outpatients treated by oral anticancer agents (OAAs) using PROs. Methods Between September 2018 and May 2019, outpatients starting OAAs were included in a 12-week follow-up to assess 15 symptoms listed in the National Cancer Institute PRO Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, using a 5-point scale of severity or frequency. Patients were requested to alert a referral nurse or pharmacist when they self-assessed high-level (level 3 or 4) symptoms. Results 407 questionnaires were completed by 63 patients in which 2333 symptoms were reported. Almost three-quarters (74.6%) reported at least one high-level symptom. The symptoms that were most commonly experienced were fatigue (>9 in 10 patients; 13.2% of symptoms declared), various psychological disorders (>9 in 10 patients; 28.6% of symptoms declared) and general pain (>8 in 10 patients; 9.4% of symptoms declared). Conclusion PROs are appropriate to detect potential adverse events in cancer outpatients treated by OAAs. This study is the first step for integrating the patient's perspective in a digital e-health device in routine oncology care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1093,35160018,"Sustained Improvements in Antimicrobial Therapy and Clinical Outcomes following a Pharmacist-Led Antimicrobial Stewardship Intervention: Uncontrolled Before-After Study.  Our antimicrobial pharmacist-led intervention included: (a) a structured review of antibiotic prescriptions; (b) educating prescribers on antimicrobial therapy; (c) monthly reporting of department-level rates of blood sampling for culture. Daily review began in May 2018 and was discontinued after 10 months; however, the other interventions were conducted throughout the study period. This study aimed to evaluate the sustained impact of pharmacist's interventions on antimicrobial therapy and clinical outcomes between the baseline (May-December 2017), intervention (May-December 2018), and post-intervention (May-December 2019) periods. The rate of blood culture collections before starting antipseudomonal agent therapy was significantly increased from the baseline to post-intervention periods (71% vs. 85%, p < 0.001). Antipseudomonal agent therapy was more frequently de-escalated in the post-intervention period than in the baseline period (73% vs. 54%, p = 0.038). Total use of antipseudomonal agents was reduced from the baseline to intervention periods and persisted during the post-intervention period (50.5 vs. 41.8 and 42.6 DDD per 1000 patient-days, p = 0.016 and p = 0.022, respectively). During the study period, there were significant reductions in the incidence of hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile infection (1.12, 0.54, and 0.51 per 10,000 patient-days, respectively, p = 0.031) and 30-day mortality with bacteremia (19%, 18%, and 12%, respectively, p = 0.005).

1094,35160166,"Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve the Anticholinergic Prescribing Practice in Older Adults: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND Pharmacotherapy in older adults is one of the most challenging aspects of patient care. Older people are prone to drug-related problems such as adverse effects, ineffectiveness, underdosage, overdosage, and drug interactions. Anticholinergic medications are associated with poor outcomes in older patients, and there is no specific intervention strategy for reducing drug burden from anticholinergic activity medications. Little is known about the effectiveness of current interventions that may likely improve the anticholinergic prescribing practice in older adults. AIMS This review seeks to document all types of interventions aiming to reduce anticholinergic prescribing among older adults and assess the current evidence and quality of existing single and combined interventions. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from January 1990 to August 2021. Only studies that examined the effect of interventions in older people focused on improving compliance with anticholinergic prescribing guidelines with quantifiable data were included. The primary outcome of interest was to find the effectiveness of interventions that enhance the anticholinergic prescribing practice in older adults. RESULTS We screened 3168 records and ended up in 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria. We found only single-component interventions to reduce anticholinergic prescribing errors in older people. Pharmacists implemented interventions without collaboration in nearly half of the studies (n = 11). Medication review (43%) and education provision (26%) to healthcare practitioners were the most common interventions. Sixteen studies (70%) reported significant reductions in anticholinergic prescribing errors, whereas seven studies (30%) showed no significant effect. CONCLUSION This systematic review suggests that healthcare practitioner-oriented interventions have the potential to reduce the occurrence of anticholinergic prescribing errors in older people. Interventions were primarily effective in reducing the burden of anticholinergic medications and assisting with deprescribing anticholinergic medications in older adults.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Geriatric,,,,Other,
1095,35160314,"Assessment of Patient Knowledge, Awareness, and Adherence in Heart Failure in a Real-Life Setting: Insights from Data Acquired in Pharmacies. BACKGROUND Patient knowledge is crucial for managing and/or monitoring patients with heart failure (HF). However, ""real-life"" evidence of knowledge level and awareness in HF is yet to be explored. We assessed unselected HF patients' knowledge and awareness in a pharmacy setting. METHODS One hundred eight HF patients (mean age [SD], 70 (12) years, 61% men) were studied in pharmacies in the north-east region of France in 2019. All patients were interviewed by their pharmacist to quantify their knowledge in HF, self-assessment of symptoms of congestion, as well as their adherence to HF treatment and guideline-recommended lifestyle. RESULTS Overall, 40% of patients had not consulted their cardiologist in the past 6 months, and 89% never underwent an HF education program. Regarding HF knowledge, nearly half were unsure whether they had HF (43.5%). Only half of the patients knew how to self-assess HF symptoms (57.4%), while a quarter (25%) were unsure of the purpose of HF medications. CONCLUSIONS In patients with HF assessed in their pharmacies, a majority lacked fundamental knowledge regarding HF, such as self-assessment of congestion, possibly due to a minimal proportion of patients undergoing an HF education program. These results suggest that interventions led by pharmacies may help improve HF education coverage in patients who may have poor access to specialized care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1096,35162213,"Self-Medication Perceptions and Practice of Medical and Pharmacy Students in Serbia. BACKGROUND Attitudes towards conventional and complementary medicine among future healthcare professionals can impact their future pharmacotherapy practice. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predisposing factors related to self-medication among medical and pharmacy students. METHODS This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, on first- and final-year students of medicine and pharmacy. The multivariate Poisson regression model with robust variance was used to identify the main predictors of self-medication. RESULTS The overall self-medication prevalence in the past year was 81.3%. Independent risk factors for self-medication identified in the regression analysis were the final study year, housing condition, i.e., living in a leased apartment or in a student dormitory in comparison to living with parents, and cigarette consumption. The conventional drugs were the most frequently used, mostly for the symptoms of cold and pain. Final-year students had more confidence in conventional medicines than in herbal drugs and were more aware of the risks of their concomitant use. CONCLUSION Self-medication is highly prevalent among students of medical sciences, especially among final-year students. Increased medical knowledge led to the higher awareness of the drug interaction risks.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1097,35162358,"Application of Novel Pharmacists' Risk in Pharmacotherapy (PHARIPH) Scale for Identification of Factors Affecting the Safety of Hospital Pharmacotherapy-An Observational Pilot Study. BACKGROUND The widespread occurrence of medication errors (MEs) has become a global problem because it poses a serious threat to the health and lives of patients, can prevent the achievement of treatment goals, undermines patient trust in the health care system, and increases treatment costs. The purpose of this study was to develop an appropriate tool to identify key risk factors that hospital pharmacists believe threaten pharmacotherapy safety in the hospital. METHODS A diagnostic survey method using the authors' PHARIPH (Pharmacists' Risk in Pharmacotherapy) scale and authorial questions was used to identify risks that may result in patient pharmacotherapy errors at the hospital pharmacist level. A total of 125 Polish hospital pharmacists participated in the study. RESULTS The original authors' created PHARIPH scale was characterized by a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.958. According to the surveyed pharmacists, the greatest threat to pharmacotherapy safety was misreading of a doctor's order (similar drug nomenclature) and preparing a wrong drug (similar drug packaging, similar drug nomenclature). Female pharmacists compared to male pharmacists attributed significantly higher importance to such risk factors such as pharmacist's ignorance of a list of drug substitutes (p = 0.047, risk 8), preparation from an expired/withdrawn drug (p = 0.002, risk 14), preparation from a drug stored in inappropriate conditions (p = 0.05, risk 15), preparation of drugs ordered in hospital and PODs (patients' own drugs) without checking for possible drug duplication (p = 0.011, risk 17) and their potential effect on patient safety. CONCLUSIONS The PHARIPH scale could be applied as a novel tool for identification of pharmacotherapy risks.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1098,35162670,"Extended Prescribing Roles for Pharmacists in Poland-A Survey Study. BACKGROUND In recent years, a systematic increase in the role and powers of pharmacists has been observed. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that this is a professional group that is extremely necessary for the smooth functioning of the health care system. One of the important powers of pharmacists is the possibility of issuing prescriptions for both patients in the pharmacy and for themselves and their family members. Polish pharmacists obtained extended entitlements in this field in March 2020. Due to the extension of pharmacists' prescribing rights in Poland, it was decided in this study to determine the current practice of pharmaceutical prescribing, and pharmacists' views on their new duties. METHODS The study used the method of a questionnaire, which was distributed to all pharmacists actively working in Poland. During the study, 309 completed questionnaires were obtained that gathered information about prescriptions written by pharmacists, as well as their opinions related to this entitlement. The results of the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Out of all authorized pharmacists, 75.62% use the new, extended authorization to issue pharmaceutical prescriptions. About half of them believe their prescriptions should be refundable. Only 11.52% of respondents do not use the entitlement to issue prescriptions for themselves or their family members. In addition, it was noticed that those who write such prescriptions most often use the fully paid version. CONCLUSIONS Polish pharmacists use the new entitlements willingly but carefully. The legal provisions governing electronic prescription should be clearer. In addition, the idea of continued prescription should be developed as this is the most common reason that pharmacists issue prescriptions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1099,35162889,"Assessment of Pharmacists' Willingness to Conduct Medication Use Reviews in Poland. INTRODUCTION Pharmacists play an important role in healthcare. Their functions are evolving and, in many countries, they actively participate in interdisciplinary patient treatment. One of the most common services provided by pharmacists as part of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies involves medication reviews. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the readiness of pharmacists to conduct medication reviews in community pharmacies. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study comprises 493 pharmacists from community pharmacies in Poland. A questionnaire (developed for the purposes of this study) was used. It consisted of eight questions regarding readiness to conduct medication reviews, along with personal data. RESULTS A total of 63.9% of the pharmacists were ready to conduct medication reviews, and 23.1% already had experience in this area. Participants were of the opinion that this service should be funded by the Ministry of Health or a third-party public payer, and overall was valued by the participants at PLN 169.04 (SD = 280.77) net per patient. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists in Poland have expressed their readiness to conduct medical reviews.

1100,35163437,"Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Promotes Cell Proliferation by Downregulation of G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 17 Expression via PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 Signaling in SK-N-SH Cells.  Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) not only regulates neuronal function and development but also is neuroprotective in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. G-protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) expression in brain tissue serves as an indicator of brain damage. As whether IGF-1 regulates GPR17 expression remains unknown, the aim of this study is to investigate how IGF-1 regulates GPR17 expression in vitro. Human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were used. Lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed to mediate the silencing of FoxO1, while adenoviral vectors were used for its overexpression. Verification of the relevant signaling cascade was performed using a FoxO1 inhibitor (AS1842856), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002), and a GPR17 antagonist (cangrelor). Cell proliferation was analyzed using EdU staining; immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression and subcellular localization of FoxO1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the binding of FoxO1 to the GPR17 promoter in SK-N-SH cells. The expression of FoxO1, GPR17, and protein kinase B (also known as Akt) mRNA and protein as well as the levels of FoxO1 and Akt phosphorylation were investigated in this study. IGF-1 was found to downregulate FoxO1 and GPR17 expression in SK-N-SH cells while promoting cell viability and proliferation. Inhibition of FoxO1 and antagonism of GPR17 were found to play a role similar to that of IGF-1. Silencing of FoxO1 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA resulted in the downregulation of FoxO1 and GPR17 expression. The overexpression of FoxO1 via adenoviral vectors resulted in the upregulation of FoxO1 and GPR17 expression. Blocking of PI3K signaling by LY294002 inhibited the effect of IGF-1 on GPR17 suppression. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that IGF-1 promotes FoxO1 nuclear export and reduces FoxO1 binding to the GPR17 promoter in SK-N-SH cells. Here, we conclude that IGF-1 enhances cell viability and proliferation in SK-N-SH cells via the promotion of FoxO1 nuclear export and reduction of FoxO1 binding to the GPR17 promoter via PI3K/Akt signaling. Our findings suggest that the enhancement of IGF-1 signaling to antagonize GPR17 serves as a potential therapeutic strategy in the management of acute ischemic stroke.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1101,35164607,"Evaluation of a Pharmacist-Developed, Nurse-Driven Protocol for Management of Parenteral Anticancer Therapy Infusion Reactions in an Ambulatory Infusion Center. PURPOSE Intravenous anticancer therapy can be associated with hypersensitivity- and/or infusion-related reactions (IRRs) which may result in life-threatening symptoms. As part of a quality improvement project, oncology pharmacists developed and implemented a nurse-driven, symptom-based IRR protocol. The objective of the evaluation was to evaluate IRR treatment failure after implementation of a symptom-based protocol in an ambulatory infusion center. Secondary objectives included determining the most common anticancer agents requiring IRR treatment, documentation of ED visits or hospital admissions within 72 h of treatment, documentation of mortality due to an IRR, and evaluating whether there were multiple documented IRRs to the same medication. METHODS A total of 456 patients, who received an infusion of anticancer therapy at Grady Health System (GHS) between February 2014 and March 2018, were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were included if they received a protocol-specific medication for infusion reaction management of a parenterally administered anticancer agent. The primary outcome was the rate of treatment failure within 72 h of treatment for an IRR. RESULTS Seventy-eight patients experiencing 108 IRRs were included in the analysis. Five percent of IRRs consisted of rigors only, 57% of IRRs were mild/moderate severity, 31% of IRRs were severe/anaphylactic severity and 7% of IRRs were rigors in addition to a mild/moderate/severe reaction. Of the 108 IRRs, treatment failure within 72 h was observed in eight reactions; six were evaluated in the emergency department and two required a hospital admission. Overall, 93% of reactions resolved in the infusion center and patients were discharged home; there were no patient deaths. The most common offending agents were paclitaxel and oxaliplatin. CONCLUSION Following implementation of a novel pharmacist-developed, symptom-based nurse-driven protocol, infusion reaction treatment failure occurred in 7% of IRRs evaluated. Although the failure rate was low, additional nurse education and improved access to protocol-directed medications may optimize use of the protocol.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1102,35164988,"Healthcare professional and professional stakeholders' perspectives on vaccine mandates in Switzerland: A mixed-methods study. BACKGROUND There currently are no mandatory vaccines in Switzerland. However, Swiss federal legislation allows for vaccination mandates in settings where the risk of transmission to vulnerable groups is high, such as healthcare professionals (HCPs) working with vulnerable patients. Since HCPs are trusted information sources, a priority population for COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially subjected to mandates, we investigated HCP perspectives on mandates. METHODS A national online survey was administered to HCPs (October 2020-March 2021), including vaccine mandates questions concerning patients (measles) and HCPs (influenza). We qualitatively investigated HCP mandate perspectives through: (1) 34 interviews with HCPs, HCP professional society representatives, and health authorities; (2) a focus group discussion (FGD) with complementary medicine (CM) and biomedical physicians, and Swiss Federal Vaccination Commission members. RESULTS 1933 participants (496 physicians, 226 pharmacists, 607 nurses, 604 midwives) responded to the survey. Quantitative results show all professional groups preferred shared parent-HCP measles vaccine decisions (65%, 54%, 50%, 48%, respectively; p for trend < 0.001). Midwives (87%) and nurses (70%) preferred individual influenza vaccination decisions for HCPs, while physicians (49%) and pharmacists (44%) preferred shared employee-employer decisions (p for trend < 0.001). Physicians (p < .001) and pharmacists (p < .01) with CM training favored individual influenza vaccination decisions. Qualitative results show general HCP opposition to vaccine mandates, mainly because participants argued how other approaches, such as HCP training and better information, could encourage uptake. Arguments against COVID-19 mandates included insufficiently documented long-term safety/efficacy data. From participants' perspectives, mandated vaccination should be used as a last resort. Some participants expressed fear that with mandates, notably for influenza and COVID-19, some HCPs might leave their jobs. HCPs were unsure what vaccine mandates would concretely look like in practice, particularly regarding sanctions for non-compliance and enforcement. CONCLUSION In Switzerland, HCPs generally were opposed to vaccination mandates. Clarity and guidance are needed from health authorities to better inform discussions around vaccine mandates.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1103,35165042,"The influence of socialization agents on consumer responses to over-the-counter medicine advertising. BACKGROUND Despite the prevalence of over-the-counter medicine advertising (OTCA) in electronic and print media, scholarly focus has tended to concentrate on direct-to-consumer prescription medicine advertising (DTCA). OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms through which attitudes toward OTCA in general and OTCA prompted behaviors are formed based on a consumer socialization framework. METHODS An online survey was conducted as part of a larger medicine and pharmaceutical advertising project using the Qualtrics online panel. A total of 819 individuals who had taken a prescription medicine in the last six months participated in the survey and yielded 539 completed questionnaires (Completion rate: 65.8%). Of those, 304 responses from U.S. adults who had taken an OTC medicine and had seen an advertisement for OTC medicines in the past six months were analyzed to test the proposed model. A series of structural equation modeling analyses of the survey data was performed. RESULTS The study results showed that consumers' use of mass media and professional interpersonal channels directly influenced attitudes toward OTCA and OTCA prompted behaviors. On the other hand, consumers' use of non-professional interpersonal channels indirectly influenced OTCA outcomes through their use of mass media and professional interpersonal channels. Younger respondents were more likely to obtain OTC medicine information from non-professional interpersonal and mass media sources whereas older respondents were more likely to obtain OTC medicine information from physicians and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS Application of the consumer socialization framework in the context of OTCA provides expanded understanding of the mechanisms through which responses to OTCA are formed. The findings of this study provide implications for pharmaceutical marketers, health professionals, and consumers of OTC medicines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1105,35165546,"Testing the Water: Osteoporosis Management in Primary Care. INTRODUCTION Osteoporosis is a common bone condition in the United Kingdom (UK). The risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures increases with age, and with the ageing population in the UK, the incidence is growing. It is imperative that General Practitioners (GPs) correctly diagnose and manage their patients with osteoporosis. To improve the awareness, a treatment pathway was developed in secondary care to guide local GPs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients at a GP practice with a population of 14,000 have been appropriately identified, coded as osteoporosis, treated, and have followed the recommended treatment pathway. METHODS This retrospective study identified three patient groups through a search of the practice IT system, using the words 'osteoporosis', 'fragility fracture', 'Quality and Outcomes Framework', and names of all medications that are used to treat osteoporosis. Group 1 consisted of patients currently on the practice osteoporosis register. Group 2 consisted of patients with a coding of 'osteoporosis' or 'fragility fracture', but not currently on osteoporosis treatment. Group 3 consisted of patients currently on osteoporosis treatment with no coding for 'osteoporosis' or 'fragility fracture'. RESULTS In Group 1, 62% were found to be following the local treatment pathway in the first cycle of the study, and 70% in the second cycle. In Group 2, 45% were found to be following the local treatment pathway in the first cycle of the study, and 43% in the second cycle. In Group 3, 86% were found to be following the local treatment pathway in the first cycle of the study, and 96% in the second cycle. The completed study cycle shows an improvement of adherence of the pathway, from 75% in the first cycle to 81% in the second cycle. The first cycle of the study was presented at the GP practice meeting, which improved the awareness of the treatment pathway. CONCLUSION This study illustrates that there is a need for improvement in the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in primary care. This can be achieved by improving awareness through continuing medical education about following the appropriate pathway to enhance the management of osteoporosis. Resources need to be allocated for prioritising osteoporosis care to prevent falls and fragility fractures, which have devastating effects on individual patients and the healthcare system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1106,35166143,"Exploring the factors and barriers of healthcare professionals in tertiary care hospitals towards pharmacovigilance: a multicenter study from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. BACKGROUND Spontaneous Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting is a cornerstone for a successful pharmacovigilance program as under-reporting of ADRs remains a major issue around the globe. The current study aimed to assess the knowledge attitude and practices of health care professionals regarding pharmacovigilance along with barriers and factors to encourage ADR reporting at tertiary care hospitals of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. METHODS A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted, using the convenience sampling method to collect the data from doctors, nurses, and pharmacists working in seven tertiary care hospitals from seven districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, between July 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS During the study, a total of 830 questionnaires were distributed, out of which 669 were returned (response rate 80.6%). Overall, Healthcare professionals exhibited poor knowledge (79.5%) about ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance however, 73.5% of pharmacists were more knowledgeable as compared to 18.7% doctors and 13.8% nurses (p < 0.001). Moreover, poor reporting practices were displayed by 95.6% doctors, 94.4% nurses 94.4% and 75.5% pharmacists (p < 0.001). However, the majority of healthcare professionals showed an overall positive attitude (94%) towards ADR reporting. The most frequently cited barriers were unavailability of reporting forms (92.5%), absence of a professional environment to discuss ADRs (82.5%), and lack of training (81.8%) whereas, most common factors to encourage ADR reporting were obligatory reporting (85.9%) and provision of ADR management guidelines and training (84.3%). A significant relation was found between the healthcare professionals and their professional status with the overall knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores (p < 0.001) whereas a medium, positive correlation was found between the knowledge and practice of pharmacovigilance and ADR reporting by the healthcare professionals (r = 0.321, n = 669, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION There is an overall lack of knowledge and poor reporting practices among health care professionals on ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance. Hence the study suggests that strategies should be devised by all the stakeholders to properly educate and train the healthcare professionals in this area to enhance overall patient safety and safe use of medicines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1107,35166780,"Development of a Metric to Detect and Decrease Low-Value Prescribing in Older Adults. Importance Metrics that detect low-value care in common forms of health care data, such as administrative claims or electronic health records, primarily focus on tests and procedures but not on medications, representing a major gap in the ability to systematically measure low-value prescribing. Objective To develop a scalable and broadly applicable metric that contains a set of quality indicators (EVOLV-Rx) for use in health care data to detect and reduce low-value prescribing among older adults and that is informed by diverse stakeholders' perspectives. Design, Setting, and Participants This qualitative study used an online modified-Delphi method to convene an expert panel of 15 physicians and pharmacists. This panel, comprising clinicians, health system leaders, and researchers, was tasked with rating and discussing candidate low-value prescribing practices that were derived from medication safety criteria; peer-reviewed literature; and qualitative studies of patient, caregiver, and physician perspectives. The RAND ExpertLens online platform was used to conduct the activities of the panel. The panelists were engaged for 3 rounds between January 1 and March 31, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures Panelists used a 9-point Likert scale to rate and then discuss the scientific validity and clinical usefulness of the criteria to detect low-value prescribing practices. Candidate low-value prescribing practices were rated as follows: 1 to 3, indicating low validity or usefulness; 3.5 to 6, uncertain validity or usefulness; and 6.5 to 9, high validity or usefulness. Agreement among panelists and the degree of scientific validity and clinical usefulness were assessed using the RAND/UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Appropriateness Method. Results Of the 527 low-value prescribing recommendations identified, 27 discrete candidate low-value prescribing practices were considered for inclusion in EVOLV-Rx. After round 1, 18 candidate practices were rated by the panel as having high scientific validity and clinical usefulness (scores of ≥6.5). After round 2 panel deliberations, the criteria to detect 19 candidate practices were revised. After round 3, 18 candidate practices met the inclusion criteria, receiving final median scores of 6.5 or higher for both scientific validity and clinical usefulness. Of those practices that were not included in the final version of EVOLV-Rx, 3 received high scientific validity (scores ≥6.5) but uncertain clinical usefulness (scores <6.5) ratings, whereas 6 received uncertain scientific validity rating (scores <6.5). Conclusions and Relevance This study culminated in the development of EVOLV-Rx and involved a panel of experts who identified the 18 most salient low-value prescribing practices in the care of older adults. Applying EVOLV-Rx may enhance the detection of low-value prescribing practices, reduce polypharmacy, and enable older adults to receive high-value care across the full spectrum of health services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND This review, commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), examined the effectiveness of the WHO 6-step hand hygiene (HH) technique in reducing microbial load on hands and covering hand surfaces, and compared its effectiveness to other techniques. METHODS Medline, CINAHL, ProQuest, Web of Science, Mednar, and Google Scholar were searched for primary studies, published in English (1978 - February 2021), evaluating the microbiological effectiveness or hand surface coverage of HH techniques in healthcare workers. Reviewers independently performed quality assessment using Cochrane tools. The protocol for the narrative review was registered (PROSPERO 2021: CRD42021236138). RESULTS Nine studies were included. Evidence demonstrated that the WHO technique reduced microbial load on hands. One study found the WHO technique more effective than the 3-step technique (P=0.02), while another found no difference between these two techniques (P=0.08). An adapted 3-step technique was more effective than the WHO technique in laboratory settings (P=0.021), but not in clinical practice (P=0.629). One study demonstrated that an adapted 6-step technique was more effective than the WHO technique (P=0.001). Evidence was heterogeneous in application time, product, and volume. All studies were high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS Eight studies found that the WHO 6-step technique reduced microbial load on healthcare workers' hands; but the studies were heterogeneous and further research is required to identify the most effective, yet feasible technique.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE This study aims to present AVICENNE as a real time medication-related clinical decision support (rt-CDS) applied to pharmaceutical analysis and its ability to detect Drug related problems (DRP) consecutively resolved by pharmacists. Basic procedures A Medication-related rt-CDS is created by integrating the software PharmaClass® (Keenturtle), 5 health data streams on the patient and Pharmaceutical algorithms (PA). PA are created by modeling the pharmaceutical experiment about DRP and the thread of their criticality. They are partially encoded as computerized rules in Pharmaclass® allowing alerts' issue. An observational prospective study is conducted during 9-months among 1000 beds in 2 health facilities. The first step is to identify alerts as DRP; their resolution follows with clear guidelines worked out for the pharmaceutical analysis. A basis on predictive positive values (PPV) of the PA is being built today helping to know the performance of DRP detection and resolution. Main findings 71 PA are encoded as rules into Pharmaclass®: 40 targeted serious adverse drug events. 1508 alerts are analyzed by pharmacists. Among them 921 DRPs were characterized and 540 pharmaceutical interventions transmitted of which 219 were accepted by prescribers. Three PPV are defined depending on software, pharmacist and patient. Principal conclusion Clinical pharmacy societies should host, share and update a national corpus of PA and exploit its educational interest.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1110,35168391,"Economic Impact of Ambulatory Clinical Pharmacists in an Advanced Heart Failure Clinic. BACKGROUND Clinical pharmacists play pivotal roles in multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) teams through the management of HF pharmacotherapy, but no study has examined the economic impact of HF ambulatory clinical pharmacists in an advanced HF clinic. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to evaluate the economic impact of HF ambulatory clinical pharmacist interventions in an advanced HF clinic using a cost-benefit analysis. METHODS This prospective observational study detailed HF ambulatory clinical pharmacist interventions over 6 months in an advanced HF clinic in a single-center tertiary teaching hospital. The economic impact of the interventions was estimated based on the indirect cost savings with pharmacist interventions and direct cost savings recommendations. A cost-benefit analysis was performed to assess the cost of delivering the interventions compared with the benefits generated by clinical pharmacists. Results were reported as a benefit-cost ratio and net benefits. RESULTS HF ambulatory clinical pharmacists made a total of 2,361 provider-accepted interventions over 6 months. Overall, the 3 most common intervention types were medication reconciliation (28.7%), dose change (20.8%), and addition of medication (12.3%). Anticoagulation (21.2%) was the most common intervened class of medication, followed by sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (12.3%) and angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (9.2%). The total net benefits were $55,553.24 over 6 months and the benefit-cost ratio was 1.55. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The addition of cardiology clinical pharmacists to an advanced HF clinic may be financially justified and cost-beneficial.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1111,35168554,"Perspectives of physicians and pharmacists on rational use of antibiotics in Turkey and among Turkish migrants in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands: a qualitative study. BACKGROUND Antimicrobial resistance may result from inappropriate use of antibiotics in health care. Turkey is one of the countries with the highest antibiotic consumption in the world. Considering the role of transnational ties between Turkish migrants and their social contacts in Turkey, the attitudes and behaviors relating to rational antibiotic use in Turkey can also affect the use of antibiotics by Turkish migrants residing abroad. This study explores physicians' and pharmacists' experiences and perspectives on rational antibiotic use among Turkish adults in Turkey and among Turkish migrants in Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands, three European countries with large populations of Turkish migrants. METHODS Following a qualitative study design using convenience and snowball sampling, in-depth interviews with 21 family physicians and 24 pharmacists were conducted in the aforementioned countries. We transcribed all interviews verbatim and performed content analysis separately in the countries, followed by translation, pooling and joint interpretation of the findings. RESULTS Physicians and pharmacists encountered irrational use of antibiotics among their patients in Turkey. Physicians interviewed in the three European countries explained that Turkish migrants differ from non-migrants with respect to their attitudes towards antibiotics, for example by more often expecting to be prescribed antibiotics. All physicians and pharmacists in the selected countries reported to inform their patients on how to use antibiotics upon prescription; however, Turkish migrants' poor language proficiency was considered as a substantial communication barrier by the physicians and pharmacists interviewed in the European countries. CONCLUSIONS The study illustrated some aspects of irrational antibiotic use among the population in Turkey and Turkish migrants in selected European countries. It emphasized the need for closer community participation, adequate information campaigns, as well as in-service training of health care providers in Turkey. The strategies and interventions on rational antibiotic use should also be supported and encouraged by health care providers, who need to reach out to people with various cultural backgrounds.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1112,35168802,"Pharmacists Act on Care Transitions in Stroke (PACT-Stroke): A Systems Approach. PURPOSE Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. Prompt secondary prevention decreases the risk for recurrence. Pharmacists have taken a more active role in poststroke care and are initiating prompt follow-up after hospital discharge. There are, however, limited descriptions providing insight on how to implement programs that address this need. The purpose of this article is to provide insights into the development of a pharmacist-driven transitions of care program for patients with stroke. METHODS This study was a single-center, retrospective assessment of patients contacted by a pharmacist. All data were analyzed descriptively. Our initial evaluation of the Pharmacists Act on Care Transitions in Stroke (PACT-Stroke) service was to quantify and categorize drug-related problems (DRPs), which included drug selection, drug form, dose selection, treatment duration, dispensing, drug use process, patient-related problems, and other. Patients were included if they were adults who experienced an ischemic stroke. Exclusion criteria for this service included pediatric patients, patients with hemorrhagic strokes, patients with transient ischemic attacks, patients >89 years of age, pregnant patients, and patients discharged to a rehabilitation facility immediately after stroke. FINDINGS A total of 27 patients were included in this analysis, with a total of 30 DRPs identified. After pharmacist intervention, roughly 83% of these DRPs were resolved. IMPLICATIONS Implementing secondary prevention measures for patients with stroke is crucial. A pharmacist-led transitions of care pilot program was implemented to address this high-risk patient population. This article serves as a framework for implementation at other institutions that aim to provide similar services and can potentially be applied to other high-risk groups.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions on the smoking cessation service provided by community pharmacists. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in May-July 2021, in electronic databases, which included PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Web of Science. Studies were included in this systematic review if they were original articles published in English language from 2010 to 2021 and evaluated the effect of any types of educational interventions intended to improve the ability of community pharmacists to provide smoking cessation services. RESULTS In total, 12 studies were included for this systematic review. The effectiveness of the educational interventions across the included studies was measured using a range of outcomes, which can be broadly categorized into 3 categories, namely changes in pharmacists' self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitude toward providing smoking cessation service, changes in pharmacists' smoking cessation practices, and changes in the effectiveness of community pharmacy based smoking cessation services. Included studies reported that educational interventions can improve pharmacists' self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitude toward smoking cessation, as well as pharmacists' smoking cessation practices. Though the evidence is limited, improvement in the effectiveness of community pharmacy based smoking cessation services has also been observed. CONCLUSION Any form educational interventions can positively impact improve community pharmacists' self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitude toward smoking cessation, as well as pharmacists' smoking cessation practices, but it is currently uncertain whether these outcomes are able to translate into higher effectiveness of the community pharmacy based smoking cessation services.",1,1,0,0,0,Reviewer 1 did not see that the study evaluated the impact of intervention on pharmacists and not on patients.,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To investigate Internet forum users' views and experiences of melatonin treatments for troubled sleep. DESIGN A thematic analysis of online disclosures about melatonin treatments was conducted. SETTING The largest Swedish Internet forum (Flashback.org). Key search terms were melatonin and circadin/cirkadin. RESULTS The search generated 2669 posts from 857 unique profiles in 174 different threads, posted between September 2004 and January 2021. The thematic analysis resulted in 4 themes: (1) being one's own pharmacist, (2) wanted and unwanted effects, (3) history of unmet needs, and (4) national guidelines and clinical practice in Sweden. CONCLUSIONS The current study suggests that experiences with melatonin treatments are diverse, and the views on exogenous melatonin polarized, albeit with a general consensus on the importance of individual factors when it comes to administration and efficacy. The study also suggests that there is an extensive off-label use of melatonin (eg, younger patients and longer treatment periods than indicated).

AIM To investigate the efficacy of a clinical pharmacist-led smartphone application (app) on medication adherence, insulin injection technique (IIT) and diabetes-related outcomes among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) receiving insulin therapy. METHOD In all, 124 women were randomly (1:1 ratio) assigned to receive app intervention plus usual care (intervention) or usual care (control), and were followed up till 12 weeks postpartum. Interventions centralized on medication adherence and IIT. Primary outcome was medication adherence assessed by the 5-item Medication Adherence Report Scale. Secondary outcomes included IIT, insulin requirement, prepartal and puerperal glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS A total of 119 patients completed the follow-up evaluation (58 intervention, 61 control). Significant more women with high medication adherence in the intervention group was observed (69.0% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.000). The other notable benefits (all p < 0.05) included patient percentage with appropriate IIT, lesser preprandial insulin dose, patient proportion with both qualified prepartal FPG and 2 hPG, and puerperal FPG or HbA1c, fewer hypoglycemia, and lower neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission rate. Cesarean delivery rate was higher among intervention cases (p < 0.05). Qualified prepartal glycemic control was related to high medication adherence and proper IIT. NICU admission was associated with complicated with gestational hypertension, deficient medication adherence and premature rupture of fetal membrane.

1119,35172202,"DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENT TO INVESTIGATE PREFERENCES FOR INCENTIVES TO PROMOTE ANTIMICROBIAL RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT. INTRODUCTION Without intervention, experts predict that antimicrobial resistance will rank amongst leading drivers of mortality in 2050. New drugs are desperately needed but given the lengthy development timelines for antimicrobial R&D, existing economic incentives fail to support a robust pipeline of new products. This study aims to elicit the preferences of stakeholders for adequate antimicrobial R&D incentive programs. METHOD A discrete choice experiment was conducted in which stakeholders (representatives from small or medium (SME) and large pharmaceutical companies, academics, clinicians and policy makers) were asked in 12 choice tasks to select their preferred incentive combinations among two hypothetical options, differing in five attributes: form of monetary incentive, total amount of monetary incentive, market exclusivity extensions, transferable exclusivity extensions vouchers and priority review vouchers. A subgroup analysis comprising only participants from the pharmaceutical industry was also conducted. RESULTS A total of 50 stakeholders (including 24 from the pharmaceutical industry) completed the survey in full. Participants preferred longer transferable exclusivity extensions and larger amounts of monetary rewards. The levels that were perceived as having the highest utility were $1 billion as total amount of incentives and transferable exclusivity extension for 18 months. The subgroup analysis provided similar findings. CONCLUSION This study suggests that survey participants viewed transferable exclusivity vouchers for 18-month term and higher ($1 billion) monetary rewards as the preferred incentives to promote antimicrobial R&D. Further work is needed to design specific incentives and ensure they are implemented effectively.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES The study underwent to evaluate the adverse events, the incidence of COVID-19 and the participant's attitude and perception towards the vaccine following Sputnik V administration through an active surveillance program. METHODS The prospective observational study was conducted four months in the Sputnik V vaccination center that enrolled 700 participants. Sociodemographic details, medical histories, COVID-19 incidences and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) of each sample were collected through face-to-face interviews and a telephonic feedback system. A self-prepared and validated questionnaire addressed their acceptances and perceptions towards the vaccination drive. RESULTS Our study reported 42.1% of AEFIs after the first dose and 9.1% after the second. Fever, pain at the injection site, body pain, headache and fatigue were predominant, while dizziness and diarrhoea were rare. However, AEFIs were not influenced by the presence of comorbidities (p > 0.05). On the other hand, there were limited post immunization (1.8%) COVID-19 patients and that too with minor severity (p < 0.01). Our participants were overall satisfied with the Sputnik V immunization. However, those presented with AEFIs on the consecutive three days depicted slightly declined gratification (p < 0.05).

BACKGROUND There is limited United Kingdom (UK) literature on general practice-based pharmacists' (PBPs') role evolution and few studies have explored general practitioners' (GPs') experiences on pharmacist integration into general practice. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate GPs' experiences with, views of, and attitudes towards PBPs in Northern Ireland (NI). METHODS A paper-based self-administered questionnaire comprising four sections was mailed in 2019 to 329 general practices across NI and was completed by one GP in every practice who had most contact with the PBP. Descriptive analyses were used and responses to open-ended questions were analysed thematically. RESULTS The response rate was 61.7% (203/329). There was at least one PBP per general practice. All GPs had face-to-face meetings with PBPs, with three-quarters (78.7%, n = 159) meeting with the PBP more than once a week. Approximately two-thirds of GPs (62.4%, n = 126) reported that PBPs were qualified as independent prescribers, and 76.2% of these (n = 96/126) indicated that prescribers were currently prescribing for patients. The majority of GPs reported that PBPs always/very often had the required clinical skills (83.6%, n = 162) and knowledge (87.0%, n = 167) to provide safe and effective care for patients. However, 31.1% (n = 61) stated that PBPs only sometimes had the confidence to make clinical decisions. The majority of GPs (> 85%) displayed largely positive attitudes towards collaboration with PBPs. Most GPs agreed/strongly agreed that PBPs will have a positive impact on patient outcomes (95.0%, n = 192) and can provide a better link between general practices and community pharmacists (96.1%, n = 194). However, 24.8% of GPs (n = 50) were unclear if the PBP role moved community pharmacists to the periphery of the primary care team. An evaluation of the free-text comments indicated that GPs were in favour of more PBP sessions and full-time posts. CONCLUSION Most GPs had positive views of, and attitudes towards, PBPs. The findings may have implications for future developments in order to extend integration of PBPs within general practice, including the enhancement of training in clinical skills and decision-making.

BACKGROUND Unresolved drug therapy-related problems (DTRPs) have economic and clinical consequences and are common causes of patients' morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the ability of community pharmacists to identify and resolve DTRPs and assessed the perceived barriers to DTRP identification and resolution. METHODS A cross-sectional study which employed the use of three simulated patients (SPs) visit to 36 selected community pharmacies in 11 local government areas in Ibadan, Nigeria. The SPs played the role of a patient with prescription for multiple ailments (23-year-old male), type 2 diabetes and hypertensive patient with medication packs (45-year-old male) and hypertensive patient with gastric ulcer with a prescription (37-year-old female). They re-enacted three rehearsed vignettes when they spoke with the pharmacists. A five-member panel of experts predetermined the DTRPs present in the vignettes (n = 11), actions to take to investigate the DTRPs (n = 9) and recommendations to resolve the DTRPs (n = 9). Pharmacists' perceived barriers to the identification and resolution of DTRPs were assessed with a self-administered questionnaire. The percentage ability to detect and resolve DTRPs was determined and classified as poor ability (≤30%), fair ability (> 30 - ≤50%), moderate ability (> 50 - ≤70%) and high ability (> 70%). RESULTS One hundred and eight visits were made by the three SPs to the pharmacies. In total, 4.42/11 (40.2%) DTRPs were identified, 3.50/9 (38.9%) actions were taken, and 3.94/9 (43.8%) recommendations were made to resolve the identified DTRPs. The percentage ability of the community pharmacists to detect and resolve DTRPs varied slightly from one vignette to another (vignette 1-49.3%, vignette 2-39.1%, vignette 3-38.8%). But overall, it was fair (40.9%). Pharmacists' perceived barriers to DTRP detection and resolution included lack of access to patient's/client's medical history and lack of software for DTRP detection. CONCLUSIONS The community pharmacists displayed fair ability in detecting and resolving DTRPs. Several barriers preventing the optimal performance of pharmacist in DTRP identification and resolution were identified including inaccessibility of patient's/client's medical history.

1124,35173616,"A Qualitative Analysis of the Culture of Antibiotic Use for Upper Respiratory Tract Infections Among Patients in Northwest Russia.  Introduction: Due to the globally persistent threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), the purpose of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the antibiotic (AB) practices, knowledge and attitudes among patients residing in five regions in the northwest part of Russia. Given the high prevalence, this study focused on ABs for Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI). Methods: The qualitative, semi-structured interviews followed a guide organized by major themes such as common symptoms, consultations with doctors and external influences in decision-making. Patient participants were recruited via convenience sampling. Fifty-five interviews were conducted among patients using ABs for URTIs purchased with or without prescription. Data was analyzed using a direct content analysis and validation rounds were conducted between interviewers and data analyzers. Results: Self-medication with ABs seemed a common practice across all five Russian regions; in some cases, patients tried to persuade pharmacists into selling them ABs without prescription. Factors, such as time spent going to the doctor, need of a sick leave or self-persuasion, influenced the decisions of whether or not to seek the doctor for symptoms of URTIs. Knowledge of ABs and AMR was generally low; however, some patients with seemingly good knowledge practiced self-medication from time to time. Family members and friends were often involved in decisions about how to handle symptoms of URTIs, especially among those patients using ABs without prescription. Few patients had noticed ABs awareness campaigns, and very few reported having learned something important from them. Conclusion: Despite enforced regulation of AB use in Russia, self-medication still exists. Knowledge is not always linked to appropriate use of AB, and the few campaigns conducted were not always noticed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed effects of pharmacist intervention on cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to July 2021. Meta-analyses of RCTs were eligible. Quality of evidence were assessed by GRADE approach. RESULTS From 9,308 publications, 149 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, and 24 studies with 85 unique meta-analyses that assessed effects of pharmacist intervention on cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, 71.7% (61/85) of unique meta-analyses showed significant impacts of pharmacist intervention. For the quality of evidence, 63.4% of meta-analyses had large heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) while 1.2%, 16.5%, 32.9% and 49.4% of meta-analyses were graded as high, moderate, low and very low quality based on GRADE approach, respectively. Among meta-analyses with moderate quality, pharmacist interventions significantly mitigated risk factors (including 6/3 mmHg reduction of blood pressure, increased the rate of lipid control, glucose control and smoking cessation (pooled OR 1.91 (1.55, 2.35), 3.11 (2.3, 4.3), and 2.3 (1.33, 3.97), respectively)) and improved medication adherence (pooled OR 1.67 (1.38, 2.02)). Furthermore, pharmacist interventions significantly reduced all-cause mortality (pooled OR 0.72 (0.58, 0.89)) and improved quality of life in patients suffering from chronic heart failure.

1126,35175184,"Acquired haemophilia A: Italian Consensus Recommendations on diagnosis, general management and treatment of bleeding. BACKGROUND Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder due to autoantibodies to coagulation factor VIII that may be secondary to autoimmune diseases, cancer, drugs, pregnancy, infections, or be idiopathic. Recurrent bleeding, often severe, mostly in muscles and soft tissues, and isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), in the absence of personal and family history of bleeding, are typical features that should raise the suspicion of AHA. Poor awareness of the disease results in diagnostic delays and inappropriate treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Italian Association of Haemophilia Centres (AICE) developed consensus recommendations in cooperation with the Italian Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (SISET). The document was shared with scientific societies of specialist physicians, laboratory professionals and pharmacists to spread knowledge about AHA and promote appropriate diagnosis/treatment. RESULTS Ready availability of the aPTT mixing test is crucial, although diagnostic confirmation and optimal management require prompt referral of patients to specialised centres with rapidly available diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. If immediate referral is unfeasible, treatment must be undertaken early, under guidance of specialised centres or based on shared protocols. Recommendations about diagnosis, general management and, in bleeding patients, haemostatic therapy using bypassing agents or replacement treatment, including the recently available recombinant porcine factor VIII, are provided, considering the different clinical settings and laboratory facilities. DISCUSSION This consensus document aims to improve the overall healthcare pathways for AHA, harmonise the management and therapeutic approaches to newly diagnosed patients and reduce the still relevant complications and mortality in this setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1127,35176759,"Evaluating hematology/oncology clinical pharmacist activities via self-reported work sampling. PURPOSE Hematology/oncology clinical pharmacists' work activities have been described in previous literature, but time spent on pharmacist tasks has not been well characterized. Random work sampling (WS) is a form of activity assessment to determine the proportion of time spent in various types of work. Based on results from previous WS evaluations at University of Utah and its Huntsman Cancer Hospital, activities were changed to maximize time dedicated to clinical activities and pharmacists' benefit to providers and patients in both inpatient and ambulatory care settings. Therefore, updated random WS evaluations were completed during spring 2019 and fall 2020. METHODS Personal digital assistant (PDA) devices were used to record hematology/oncology clinical pharmacists' onsite or remote location and work activity data. Data were collected 8 times per hour on weekdays, with a goal of 275 observations per pharmacist. Results were then classified as clinical, professional, or technical activities. RESULTS In 2019, 9,079 observations were recorded by 31 onsite pharmacists. In 2020, 28 pharmacists recorded 8,803 observations (5,524 during onsite work and 3,279 during remote work). The overall distribution of pharmacists' work activities remained stable between 2019 and 2020, with 89% of activities classified as clinical or professional. Pharmacists spent a smaller proportion of time on in-person communication in 2020, balanced by increases in chart review and text-based communication. Onsite pharmacists reported a larger proportion of clinical activities, while remote pharmacists reported a larger proportion of professional activities.

1128,35177374,"Evaluation of patient satisfaction and perceptions of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication administration service in a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, restrictions, and social distancing requirements for medical offices reduced scheduling availability and increased virtual televisits by providers. COVID-19 restrictions created a barrier to health care access for patients who are being administered long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in an already vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE To describe an LAI medication administration service at a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to evaluate patient satisfaction with the administration of LAIs by a pharmacist service in a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare the patient's perceptions of receiving LAIs in a community-based pharmacy with those in another setting previously used for medication administration. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Independent full-service community-based pharmacy. PRACTICE INNOVATION Implementation of an LAI administration service after an increase in provider referrals of patients to the community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. EVALUATION METHODS A 4-month prospective convenience sample study conducted to evaluate the LAI medication administration service. The survey containing 32 questions was adapted with permission from a previous survey administered in a large grocery store chain to a similar population. Survey results were reported using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Eleven patients completed the survey. A total of 82% of patients strongly agreed that they felt comfortable with receiving this service at the community-based pharmacy and were satisfied with the privacy during the service. Seventy-one percent of patients who received this service elsewhere strongly agreed the LAI medication administration service was more convenient than a similar service received elsewhere, yet only 18% of patients strongly agreed that the community-based pharmacy was near their work or home. CONCLUSION A medication administration service for LAIs was developed in a community-based pharmacy, and patients were satisfied with the service.

Nonadherence was defined as missing an injection by > 3 days for risperidone microspheres and > 7 days for paliperidone palmitate. Pre-LAIA and post-LAIA hospitalizations and rehospitalizations were assessed using a pre-post design with equivalent periods. Descriptive statistics were used for demographics and diagnoses. Nonparametric tests were used to analyze primary and secondary outcomes. Results The study included 97 veterans; 44 took risperidone microspheres and 53 received paliperidone palmitate. Participants' average mean (SD) age was 46 (13.8) years, 92% were male, and 94% were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Veterans administered risperidone microspheres had fewer mean (SD) post-LAIA hospitalizations (0.4 [1.0] vs 0.9 [1.5]; P = .02), were less likely to be rehospitalized (22.7% vs 47.2%; P = .013) and had a shorter mean (SD) treatment duration (41.6 [40.2] vs 58.2 [45.7] weeks; P = .04) compared with paliperidone palmitate. Conclusion Veterans receiving risperidone microspheres had fewer posttreatment psychiatric hospitalizations and were less likely to be rehospitalized.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction despite improved life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLWH), aging, comorbidities, and associated drug treatment increase the risk for drug therapy problems (DTPs). We assessed pharmacists´ identification and resolution of DTPs among PLWH. Methods a prospective study was conducted among PLWH aged ≥10 years (N=100) in a Nigerian HIV clinic. Trained pharmacists delivered a six-step intervention that included the establishment of patient-provider relationship, gathering and validation of patient´s data, identification of DTPs, intervention, outcome identification, and documentation. Descriptive statistics were used to examine data collected via a pharmaceutical care assessment tool. Results in all, 215 DTPs were identified and classified as unnecessary drug therapy [27.4% (n=59)], non-adherence [21.9% (n=47)], needs additional drug therapy [16.7% (n=36)], adverse drug reaction [(14.0% (n=30)], wrong drug [(10.7% (n=23)], and dosage variation [n=20 (9.3%)]. Within each DTP class, the most common cause was addiction/recreational drug use [39.0% (n=23)], drug product not available [63.8% (n=30)], untreated condition(s) [61.1% (n=22)], undesirable effects [66.7% (n=20)], condition refractory to drug [34.8% (n=8)], and drug interaction [45.0% (n=9)], respectively.

1133,35180236,"Study protocol: Effectiveness of patient centered pharmacist care in improving medication adherence, clinical parameters and quality of life among hemodialysis patients. BACKGROUND Patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) often have several chronic comorbidities, which necessitate the use of several medications and hence put them at high risk of polypharmacy. Medication-related problems (MRPs) among HD patients are a serious issue as they can increase morbidity and nonadherence with medications. To overcome this issue, a unique pharmacy practice model including medication review (MR) and motivational interviewing (MI) is needed to improve medication adherence, by reducing MRPs and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of MR and MI in improving medication adherence, quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who are on dialysis. METHOD AND DESIGN This pre-post study will be conducted prospectively among patients with ESRD who have been on dialysis at the Hemodialysis Unit, Hospital Kuala Lumpur and the Hemodialysis Affiliated Centers of the University Malaya Medical Centre, from August 2020 till August 2021. Medication adherence will be assessed using the General Medication Adherence Scale (GMAS), whilst patients' HRQOL will be assessed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 36 (KDQOL-36). Clinical parameters such as blood glucose level, calcium, phosphate, hemoglobin and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels will be obtained from medical records. A total of 70 patients will be recruited. DISCUSSION We hypothesize that the implementation of pharmacy-based MR and MI may expect an increase in medication adherence scores and increase in HRQOL scores from baseline as well as achieving the clinical lab parameters within the desired range. This would indicate a need for a pharmacist to be involved in the multidisciplinary team to achieve a positive impact on medication adherence among hemodialysis patients.

1134,35180273,"Assessing content and factors influencing responses to information requests in community pharmacies in Jordan: A simulated patients study. OBJECTIVES To assess the management of requests for information about a prescription only medicine (simvastatin for treatment of dyslipidemia) by pharmacy staff in community settings and explore the factors influencing the information content. METHODS A cross sectional study conducted using the stimulated patient (SP) method between November 2018 and May 2019. The SP conveyed the request at the beginning of the encounter in a standardized way based on predetermined plots and was instructed to ask the pharmacy staff directly if information was not discussed spontaneously. After the visit, the SP provided written feedback including information about the scenario and a copy of individualized feedback. The study was reported according to the checklist for reporting research using simulated patient methodology (CRiSP). Factors influencing information content with or without information demand were investigated. RESULTS A total of 55 visits were analyzed. The average content score for the information discussed spontaneously was 16.2% with the standard deviation (SD) equal to15.6. The score improved significantly after information was demanded by the SP; the average total information content score became 34.4% (SD = 16) with p < 0.001. The score of information discussed spontaneously was higher for male pharmacy staff, older age, more experience, and a Pharm D degree. When the SP prompted or demanded for information, older pharmacy staff with more experience and with a college degree scored higher. Independent pharmacies, longer visit durations, and less distraction were associated significantly with higher information scores Pharmacy staff aged 35-39 and those with 6-10 years of experience were significant contributors to spontaneous discussion of information with p values = 0.003 and 0.013, respectively. After the SP demanded information, pharmacy staff with less than 5 years of experience and greater confidence as well as longer visits were positively predicting higher information scores with p values of 0.049, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Information provided by community pharmacists responding to information requests about prescription only medications was found to be suboptimal. Patient requests for information were found to be a positive driver for better information content. Further research of mixed methodologies is required to clarify the factors and motivators enabling information exchange in community settings and to outline true training needs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1135,35180569,"Effect of pharmaceutical care program on depression among women with epilepsy: A randomized controlled trial (IPHIWWE study).  Depression is the most frequent comorbidity of epilepsy, and they are both complex chronic diseases that affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL), especially in women. Pharmaceutical care may contribute significantly to the improvement of HRQOL in women with epilepsy (WWE), with the involvement of the pharmacist in the healthcare team treatments could be optimized and negative outcomes related to medication reduced. This was a randomized controlled trial involving WWE over 18 years of age. The intervention group (IG) received a Pharmaceutical care program consisting of medication review follow-up according to Dáder's method, health education, aids for adherence to treatment, registration of seizures and possible triggers, and therapeutic drug monitoring of anticonvulsants. The control group (CG) received the usual care in the institution. The impact in depression was assessed by changes in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, which was applied both at the first and the last interviews, six months later. One hundred eighty-two WWE entered the study and 144 (79.1%) completed it. At the beginning of the study, 48.95% showed signs of depression, decreasing to 30.43% for the patients in the IG (p-value = 0.0238), while for the patients in the CG it remained at 47.30% (p-value = 0.8693). The Wilcoxon test for comparing the change (Δ) (before-after) in the CES-D scores, between groups, yielded a w = 3138.5, p-value = 0.01802 proving there were statistically significant differences. The study proved that the application of a Pharmaceutical Care program significantly decreases signs of depression in WWE.

1138,35180860,"Exploring the barriers and facilitators to non-medical prescribing experienced by pharmacists and physiotherapists, using focus groups. BACKGROUND Non-medical prescribing (NMP) was introduced into the United Kingdom to enhance patient care and improve access to medicines. Early research indicated that not all non-medical prescribers utilised their qualification. A systematic review described 15 factors influencing NMP implementation. Findings from a recent linked Delphi study with independent physiotherapist and pharmacist prescribers achieved consensus for 1 barrier and 28 facilitators. However, item ranking differed for pharmacist and physiotherapist groups, suggesting facilitators and barriers to NMP differ depending on profession. The aim of this study was to further explore the lived experiences of NMP by pharmacists and physiotherapists. METHOD Study design and analytical approach were guided by Interpretative Phenomenology Analysis principles. Focus groups (November and December 2020) used the 'Zoom®﻿' virtual platform with pharmacist and physiotherapist prescribers. Each focus group followed a topic guide, developed a priori based on the Delphi study results, and was audio recorded digitally. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis and data were visualised using a concept map and sunburst graph, and a table of illustrative quotes produced. Research trustworthiness was enhanced through critical discussion of the topic guide and study findings by the research group and by author reflexivity. The study is reported in line with COREQ guidelines. RESULTS Participants comprised three physiotherapists and seven pharmacists. Five themes were identified. The most frequently mentioned theme was 'Staff', and the subtheme 'Clinical team', describing the working relationship between participants and team members. The other themes were 'Self', 'Governance', 'Practical aspects' and 'Patient care'. Important inter-dependencies were described between themes and subthemes, for example between 'Governance' and 'Quality and Safety'. Differences were highlighted between the professions, some relating to the way each profession practises (for example decision making), others to the way the prescribing role had been established (for example administration support). CONCLUSIONS The key finding of collaborative working with the clinical team emphasises its impact on successful implementation of NMP. Themes may be inter-dependent, and inter-profession differences were identified. Specifically designed prescribing roles were beneficial for participants. For full NMP benefits to be realised all aspects of such roles must be fully scoped, before recruiting or training non-medical prescribers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Human physiology undergoes extensive changes in space potentially leading to alterations in the way a medication functions. Understanding the efficacy behind Pharmacological Countermeasures (PCMs) and deliverable pharmacy services is imperative for the future presence of humans in space. However, while the pharmacist plays an integral role for human health terrestrially, pharmacist input has been minimal for human health in the space sector. Here, we explore the pharmacist's potential role in larger medical teams for future missions. OBJECTIVE To explore pharmacy and space sector stakeholder perspectives regarding the pharmacist's role in the space sector. METHODS Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with pharmacy (n = 31) and human health-related space sector stakeholders (n = 26) across the globe from governmental, commercial, industry and academic sectors. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to identify stakeholders. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. RESULTS Three themes - medication management, medication-related research and medication and health information - were generated. The importance of medication optimisation within commercial and federal spaceflight participant medication regimens was cited as necessary for sustainable space exploration. Both groups advocated for pharmacists' involvement with in-situ medication manufacturing and medication-related research, particularly regarding space-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug profiling. Other essential roles included the pharmacist's role in providing medication information to spaceflight participants and other healthcare professionals on their health status and medication use risk in the context of space.

BACKGROUND To enable services to be provided at a distance during the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient pharmacy services in Australia underwent near-immediate reform by moving to telehealth, including telephone and video consults. OBJECTIVE To investigate how telehealth was used in a metropolitan outpatient pharmacy setting before and after the start of the COVID-19 restrictions and the various influences on the uptake of phone and video modalities. METHODS A multi-methods approach was used including: (1) quantifying administrative activity data between July 2019 to December 2020 and, (2) semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (n = 34). RESULTS Activity data: Between July 2019 to December 2020 16,377 outpatient pharmacy consults were provided. Of these, 13,543 (83%) were provided in-person, 2,608 (16%) by telephone and 226 (1.4%) by video consult. COVID-19 impacted how these services were provided with telephone activity more than four-times higher in April 2020 than March 2020 and slight increases in video consults. Pharmacists have heavily favoured using the telephone despite the recommendation that video consults be used as the primary mode of contact and that telephone only be used when a video consult was not possible. As soon as COVID-19 restrictions eased, clinicians gradually returned to in-person appointments, maintaining some use of telephone and very limited use of video consult. Semi-structured interviews: Whilst clinicians recognised the potential benefits of video consults, challenges to routine use included the additional administrative and planning work required pre-consult, perceptions that patients were unable to use the technology, and the belief that in-person care was 'better' and that the telephone was easier. CONCLUSION Organisational strategies that encouraged the use of video over telephone (e.g. through financial incentives) did not appear to influence clinicians' choice of care modality. Implementation studies are required to co-develop solutions to embed telehealth options into outpatient pharmacy settings that provide the best experience for both patients and clinicians.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1142,35184003,"A community-based tobacco cessation program for individuals experiencing homelessness. BACKGROUND Tobacco use is common among persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), and interventions are needed. We conducted a community-based, single-arm uncontrolled trial of a pharmacy-linked intervention for smoking cessation for PEH. METHODS The intervention took place between September 2019 and June 2021 in homeless shelters in San Francisco, CA. We trained shelter staff on how to provide brief cessation counseling, then tested a program among PEH in two shelters that included one-time pharmacist-delivered cessation counseling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for 3 months. We examined factors associated with cigarette consumption and quit attempts. RESULTS We trained 69 staff from 8 shelters and selected 2 of those shelters as pilot sites for the program. Of the 52 participants, 71% were male and 49% were Black. The majority of participants reported making a quit attempt (70%) and using NRT (84%). Having an encounter with staff in the past week was associated with a 40% reduction in weekly consumption (Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.57-0.67) and using medications in the past week was associated with a 23% reduction in weekly consumption (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75-0.81). Using medications in the past week increased the odds of a quit attempt 2.89 times compared to not using medications (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.89, 95% CI 1.45-5.77).

We included 782 interactions; these were found in an older, polymedicated patient population (mean age: 68 y, median of 5 other drugs). Ibuprofen (in 43.0% of cases) and low-dose aspirin (78.8%) were the most frequently involved NSAID and antithrombotic, respectively. Anticoagulants were involved in 16.1% of interaction cases. For 61% of cases, the interacting drugs were prescribed by the same physician. The pharmacist-physician discussion about how to manage the interaction mostly resulted in no change of pharmacotherapy (60.7%); most frequent reason given by physicians was that the NSAID was for short-term use only.

INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that occurs when backflow of the gastric contents into the esophagus results in troublesome symptoms. Though GERD has been extensively studied in Western populations, literature on the management of GERD in patients in Africa and Middle East (AME) is scarce. AREAS COVERED In this review, we provide an overview of the management of mild-to-moderate GERD in AME. Here we focus on the efficacy and safety of currently available treatments for GERD to help physicians and community pharmacists appropriately manage patients with mild-to-moderate GERD in the primary healthcare setting, detailing specific situations and patient scenarios that are relevant to the region, including management of GERD during Ramadan and post-bariatric surgery. EXPERT OPINION Under-appreciation of the burden of GERD in the region has resulted in a lack of consensus on management. Barriers that currently prevent the adoption of treatment guidelines in the primary healthcare setting may include lack of availability of local guidelines and referral systems, a paucity of region-specific research, and dogmatic adherence to traditional practice. By increasing awareness, strengthening knowledge, and by more effective utilization of resources, physicians and pharmacists could optimize GERD management strategies to better support patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Individuals with serious mental illnesses experience deaths related to smoking at a higher prevalence than individuals without a psychotic-spectrum disorders. Traditional smoking cessation programs are often not effective among individuals with chronic mental disorders. Little is known about how to implement a tobacco cessation treatment program for this at-risk population within a community health center. The current study used qualitative methods to examine the factors that may enhance or impede the delivery of a novel tobacco cessation treatment for smokers with a psychotic-spectrum disorder diagnosis in an integrated care community health center. METHODS Using a case study design, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with primary care providers, mental health providers, addiction counselors, case managers, intake specialists, schedulers, pharmacists, and administrative staff employed at the organization. Interviews were transcribed and themes were identified through a rich coding process. RESULTS We identified environmental factors, organizational factors, provider factors and patient factors which describe the potential factors that may enhance or impede the implementation of a smoking cessation program at the integrated care community health center. Most notably, we identified that community mental health centers looking to implement a smoking cessation program for individuals with chronic mental health disorders should ensure the incentives for providers to participate align with the program's objectives. Additionally, organizations should invest in educating providers to address stigma related to smoking cessation and nicotine use.

Background Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States (US), with 12 cancer causing strains. Vaccination rates in the southern US fall below the national average. Pharmacists provide an opportunity to improve vaccination rates. Objectives The objectives of this study were to 1) identify barriers and facilitators to providing the HPV vaccine and Vaccines for Children (VFC) program participation in pharmacies and clinics, and 2) assess pharmacy staff, clinic staff, and parent perceptions of 3 collaboration models to improve HPV vaccination. Methods A developmental formative evaluation was conducted with pharmacy staff, primary care clinic staff, and parents of adolescent children. Interview guides were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination and VFC participation were explored. Additionally, acceptability of 3 collaboration models were explored: 1) a shared-responsibility model in which a physician provides the first dose of HPV vaccine with the second provided in the pharmacy, 2) a pharmacy-based model in which a clinic refers patients to the pharmacy to receive both doses, and 3) an insourced model in which pharmacists schedule days to provide the vaccine in the collaborating clinic. Results Twenty-nine interviews were conducted between August 2019 and June 2020. Both pharmacy and clinic staff had positive views toward the HPV vaccine and vaccinations in general. Pharmacists and physicians reported parental awareness and education as a barrier to HPV vaccination. Counseling about HPV vaccine was reported as being more time-consuming because of the stigma associated with the vaccine. Parents were willing to have their children vaccinated for HPV in the pharmacy but desired their child's physician be involved in the immunization process. The shared-responsibility model was the most favored of the 3 collaboration models. Conclusion Perceptions of the HPV vaccine and vaccination in pharmacies were positive.

PURPOSE Numerous clinical scoring tools exist for a variety of patient populations and disease states, but few tools provide information specifically designed for use by critical care pharmacists. The medication regimen complexity intensive care unit (MRC-ICU) score was designed to provide high-level information about the complexity of critically ill patient's medication regimens for use by critical care pharmacists. To date, implementation of this score in the electronic medical record (EMR) has not been reported. SUMMARY Using an agile project management framework, the MRC-ICU score was rapidly implemented into an academic medical center's EMR. The score automatically calculates on all critically ill patients and is available for critical care pharmacists to triage patient review in their individual workflow. Reporting capabilities of the score also allow for granular complexity trending over time and between units, supplementing other objective measures of pharmacist workload. CONCLUSION The MRC-ICU score can be quickly implemented into the EMR for pharmacist use in real time.

INTRODUCTION Benefits and risks of preventive medication change over time for ageing patients and deprescribing of medication may be needed. Deprescribing of cardiovascular and antidiabetic drugs can be challenging and is not widely implemented in daily practice. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to identify barriers and enablers of deprescribing cardiometabolic medication as seen by healthcare providers (HCPs) of different disciplines, and to explore their views on their specific roles in the process of deprescribing. METHODS Three focus groups with five general practitioners, eight pharmacists, three nurse practitioners, two geriatricians, and two elder care physicians were conducted in three cities in The Netherlands. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Directed content analysis was performed on the basis of the Theoretical Domains Framework. Two researchers independently coded the data. RESULTS Most HCPs agreed that deprescribing of cardiometabolic medication is relevant but that barriers include lack of evidence and expertise, negative beliefs and fears, poor communication and collaboration between HCPs, and lack of resources. Having a guideline was considered an enabler for the process of deprescribing of cardiometabolic medication. Some HCPs feared the consequences of discontinuing cardiovascular or antidiabetic medication, while others were not motivated to deprescribe when the patients experienced no problems with their medication. HCPs of all disciplines stated that adequate patient communication and involving the patients and relatives in the decision making enables deprescribing. Barriers to deprescribing included the use of medication initiated by specialists, the poor exchange of information, and the amount of time it takes to deprescribe cardiometabolic medication. The HCPs were uncertain about each other's roles and responsibilities. A multidisciplinary approach including the pharmacist and nurse practitioner was seen as the best way to support the process of deprescribing and address barriers related to resources. CONCLUSION HCPs recognized the importance of deprescribing cardiometabolic medication as a medical decision that can only be made in close cooperation with the patient. To successfully accomplish the process of deprescribing they strongly recommended a multidisciplinary approach.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

CONSENSUS PANEL To develop consensus recommendations that ensure the best possible diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhoidal disease in Saudi Arabia, the consensus panel consisted of experts in surgery in Saudi Arabia who met from December 2017 to September 2018. CONSENSUS FINDINGS The discussions focused on the need: to set up a proctology society in Saudi Arabia to assess the prevalence of hemorrhoidal disease and to regulate the role of health-care professionals (HCPs) in the management of the disease; to initiate guidelines to ensure proper diagnosis (considering symptoms, medical history, and physical/clinical examination) and treatment (topical creams and suppositories should be limited as no strong evidence supports their efficacy); to educate patients on diet and lifestyle modifications using education materials and social media during and after the treatment (regular physical activity, drinking enough fluids, regular meal time with food rich in fibers, and regular bowel habit with non-straining defecation); to refer patients to a general/colorectal surgeon when needed; and to teach junior surgeons the best use of surgical techniques. CONCLUSION These recommendations can be a step forward toward a recognized guidance for all HCPs in Saudi Arabia for a better management of hemorrhoidal disease. They will be of a great value for general practitioners, family medicine doctors, junior surgeons, and pharmacists who are the gate keepers and first contact with patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1153,35188826,"Exploring the eHealth literacy and mobile health application utilisation amongst Malaysian pharmacy students. INTRODUCTION Pharmacy students should be eHealth literate by being skilful in searching, evaluating and applying online health information. Mobile health applications should be utilised when making clinical decisions to achieve optimal patient care with the ever-changing pharmacy practice. This study aims to explore the eHealth literacy and mobile health application utilisation amongst pharmacy undergraduates. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2021. An online survey, consisting of socio-demographic characteristics, Internet use, eHealth Literacy Scale and mobile health application utilisation, was distributed amongst pharmacy undergraduates in public and private universities in Malaysia. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS A total of 415 participants completed the survey (response rate    =    82.5%). The median eHealth Literacy Scale score (out of 40) was 31.0    ±    3.0 (interquartile range). More than one-third of participants (34.7%) were found to have low eHealth literacy. Many lacked confidence in making health decisions from online information (42.4%) and skills in distinguishing between high-quality and low-quality health resources (35.2%). Only 70.4% of the participants had mobile health applications installed on their smartphones and/or tablets. Some students felt that they were neither knowledgeable nor skilful enough to utilise mobile health applications (24.8%), whereas 23.9% were unaware of the mobile health applications available. CONCLUSION In summary, the eHealth literacy of Malaysian pharmacy students can be further enhanced by incorporating eHealth literacy-focused programmes into the curriculum. Moreover, pharmacy students' mobile health application utilisation can be improved through increased awareness and support from universities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1154,35188928,"Patient Safety Education in Entry to Practice Pharmacy Programs: A Systematic Review. OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize, summarize, and evaluate the quality of extant quantitative and qualitative literature related to patient safety in pharmacy education. This systematic review included literature that targeted the content, delivery, and outcomes of patient safety in addition to literature that explored the perspectives of pharmacy students and faculty on how patient safety is integrated within their curricula. METHODS A systematic review was conducted. Four electronic databases were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2019: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect. Selection was based on prespecified criteria and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Two independent reviewers selected articles, extracted data, and assessed articles' qualities using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by consulting a third reviewer. Descriptive synthesis of data was performed. RESULTS Twenty-five eligible articles were included. The majority of studies originated from United States (n = 15). Educational content involved principles of patient safety, and identification, disclosure, and management of medication errors. There was a lack of standardization on how patient safety is incorporated into the pharmacy curricula. Eleven articles (64%) were interprofessional in nature, delivered as a patient safety course (n = 6), through simulation (n = 3), as seminars (n = 1), or as part of student experiential learning (n = 1). Of the 7 articles discussing delivery of patient safety through courses or modules, 4 (57%) were offered as elective courses. Students' perceptions and attitudes significantly improved after all patient safety interventions, reflecting the importance of addressing patient safety in education to ensure optimum future practice. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review demonstrated how patient safety education was incorporated into pharmacy programs in terms of the content and methods of delivery. It was promising to see patient safety content being delivered interprofessionally and in experiential education. Students and faculty regarded implementing patient safety in education as an essential act to meet future work demands.

BACKGROUND The hematopoietic cellular therapy (HCT) pharmacist is an essential member of the multidisciplinary care team. Yet, standardized incorporation of a pharmacist at transplant centers remains challenging. Implementation science uses theory-driven and systematic approaches to integrate interventions into clinical practice. We describe our experience implementing an HCT pharmacist at our center and conducted a program evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of HCT pharmacist medication management services on allogeneic stem cell transplant patients utilizing the RE-AIM framework. STUDY DESIGN We implemented one full-time equivalent pharmacist to provide medication management services through a collaborative practice agreement (CPA) to the allogeneic transplant population at a medium-sized center in rural Pennsylvania over a two-year period. The HCT pharmacist documented all in-person and telephonic care encounters in the electronic medical record. A pharmacist intervention tool was developed to document identified medication related problems (MRPs) with corresponding interventions and magnitude of intervention. The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework was utilized to evaluate the impact of the HCT pharmacist. Summary statistics including frequency and percentages were presented for categorical variables in RE-AIM domain. RESULTS Over the 2-year period, the HCT pharmacist followed 40 allogeneic patients at our institution accounting for 1531 patient encounters. The average duration of follow-up was 299 days. The HCT pharmacist medication therapy services were able to reach all allogeneic transplants at our institute. The HCT pharmacist managed 388 medications and identified 2156 medication related problems for which the pharmacist provided 2959 interventions. Time in therapeutic range of immunosuppression was 74% when managed by the HCT pharmacist through a CPA. Of the 24 patients and 9 caregivers who completed the patient satisfaction survey, 25 (76%) were strongly satisfied with their care. Pharmacy services were gradually adopted and expanded to incorporate additional populations, including 121 autologous transplant and 272 hematology patient encounters. The role of the HCT pharmacist was justified with hospital administration and sustained as a designated pharmacist role at our center. CONCLUSION The implementation of an HCT pharmacist service can positively impact patient care. The RE-AIM framework provides a methodological approach for programmatic evaluation and generalizability.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1163,35190157,"Perceived stress, academic self-concept, and coping mechanisms among pharmacy students following a curricular revision. INTRODUCTION Pharmacy students experience high levels of perceived stress. Data regarding the impact of curricular revision on students' stress level are lacking. The primary objective of this study was to compare perceived stress, academic self-concept, and coping strategies between pharmacy students prior to and following a curricular revision. Secondary objectives included determining university resources used by students to deal with stress. METHODS Students in the first, second, and third years of the pharmacy curriculum were asked to complete a survey, including the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), Brief COPE, and Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS), and questions regarding use of university resources. Responses to the PSS-14, Brief COPE, and ASCS were compared to a student cohort prior to the curricular revision. RESULTS Perceived stress was reduced to a small, statistically significant degree following a curricular revision. In both cohorts, increased stress was statistically significantly correlated with decreased academic self-concept. Students reported increased use of self-distraction, along with decreased use of active coping, substance abuse, and planning, as coping strategies when compared to the previous cohort. Approximately half of the student cohort reported no use of university resources. The most commonly used resources were financial aid and mental health services.

1172,35190430,"PrEP distribution in pharmacies: a systematic review. INTRODUCTION Novel mechanisms of service delivery are needed to expand access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Providing PrEP directly through pharmacies could offer an additional option for reaching potential users. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of studies examining effectiveness, values and preferences of end users and health workers, and cost of PrEP initiation and continuation through pharmacies (pharmacy access). We searched PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and EMBASE through 2 December 2020. We also searched clinical trial registries and recent HIV conference abstracts. Standardised methods were used to search, screen and extract data from included studies. RESULTS No studies met the inclusion criteria for the effectiveness review, for either PrEP initiation or continuation. However, six 'case studies' presenting non-comparative data from PrEP pharmacy programmes demonstrated feasibility of this model in the USA. Eleven studies reported values and preferences of end users and health workers. In the USA, Kenya and South Africa, potential PrEP clients generally supported pharmacy access, although some preferred clinics. One study of PrEP pharmacy clients found all would 'definitely recommend' the programme. Six studies found pharmacists were generally supportive of offering PrEP; one study including doctors found more limited favour, while one study of diverse Kenyan stakeholders found broad support. Three studies reported cost data indicating client willingness to pay in the USA and Kenya and initial sustainability of a clinic financial model in the USA. CONCLUSION Provision of PrEP through pharmacies has been demonstrated to be feasible in the USA and acceptable to potential end users and stakeholders in multiple settings. Limited evidence on effectiveness and requirements for laboratory testing and assurance of high-quality services may limit enthusiasm for this approach. Further research is needed to determine if pharmacy access is a safe and effective way to help achieve global HIV prevention goals.

In 2014, 67% (347/521) of hospital pharmacists experienced shortages of antimicrobials compared with 77% (1032/1348) in 2018, 63% (1158/1837) in 2019 and 37% (539/1466) in 2020. More than 80% of hospital pharmacists managed antibiotic shortages through substitution in 2014 (284/336) and 2018 (786/946), while this percentage was 40% (63/158) and 42% (620/1466) in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Although 72% (870/1204) of hospital pharmacists received information on how to avoid inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, dispensing and administration, only 37% (450/1204) changed their views and 28% (338/1204) changed their practice in steering antimicrobial treatment. CONCLUSION Antibiotic shortages affect proper antimicrobial stewardship because of limited appropriate alternatives, taking into account patients' clinical condition and type of infection. While substitution remains a leading mitigating tool for antibiotic shortages, it carries numerous risks and the potential for antimicrobial resistance and suboptimal health outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1177,35190512,"Should Pharmacists Lead Medication Reconciliation in Critical Care? A One-Stem Interventional Study in an Egyptian Intensive Care Unit. OBJECTIVES The main objective was to compare physician-obtained medication histories to the practice of medication reconciliation undertaken by a pharmacist in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS A one-stem interventional study involving 500 adults 18 years and older admitted to the ICU (50 beds) of an Egyptian Joint Commission International-accredited reference hospital was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of ICU patients with missing medications in the cohorts of physician versus pharmacist-led medication reconciliation. The secondary outcome measure was the percentage of patients who had at least one clinical condition or adverse event (AE) that was left untreated during hospitalization of the 2 arms of patients after reconciliation. RESULTS A total of 500 patients received reconciliation. Medication discrepancies in the cohort of physician-led reconciliation were greater than that of the pharmacist (26.1% versus 2.6%, P = 0.001). The most common discrepancy was indication with no medication, which was found to be greater in the physician-led cohort of patients than that of the pharmacist cohort (25.2% versus 2.6%, P = 0.001). Untreated AEs in the former cohort were present in 9.1% of cases versus 1.5% in the pharmacist-led reconciliation cohort (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The present study revealed that pharmacist-led medication reconciliation in ICU has dramatically decreased medication discrepancies and AEs in adults with acute ICU admissions.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Critical care,,,,Inpatient,

1179,35191159,"Pharmacogenomic testing: perception of clinical utility, enablers and barriers to adoption in Australian hospitals. BACKGROUND Despite healthcare professionals' endorsing the clinical utility of pharmacogenomics testing, use in clinical practice is limited. AIMS Assess healthcare professionals' perceptions of pharmacogenomic testing and identify barriers to implementation. METHODS Health professionals (HCPs) involved in prescribing decisions at three hospitals in Sydney, Australia were invited to participate. The online survey assessed perceptions of pharmacogenomic testing, including (i) demographic and practice variables; (ii) use, knowledge and confidence; (iii) perceived benefits; (iv) barriers to implementation; (v) operational and/or system changes and personnel required to implement on site. RESULTS HCPs were predominantly medical practitioners (75/107) and pharmacists (25/107). HCPs perceived pharmacogenomic testing was beneficial to identify reasons for drug intolerance (85/95) and risk of side effects (86/95). Although testing was considered relevant to their practice (79/100), few HCPs (23/100) reported past or intended future (26/100) use. Few HCPs reported confidence in their ability to identify indications for pharmacogenomic testing (14/107), order tests (19/106) and communicate results with patients (16/107). Lack of clinical practice guidelines (62/79) and knowledge (54/77) were identified as major barriers to implementation of pharmacogenomics. Comprehensive reimbursement for testing and clinical practice guidelines, alongside models-of-care involving multidisciplinary teams and local clinical champions were suggested as strategies to facilitate implementation of pharmacogenomic testing into practice. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacogenomic testing was considered important to guide drug selection and dosing decisions. However, limited knowledge, low confidence and an absence of guidelines impedes the use of pharmacogenomic testing. Establishment of local resources including multidisciplinary models-of-care was suggested to facilitate implementation of pharmacogenomics. This article is protected by copyright.

1180,35191505,"Recent progress in three-dimensionally-printed dosage forms from a pharmacist perspective. OBJECTIVE Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing (3DP), has opened new frontiers in pharmaceutical applications. This review is aimed to summarise the recent development of 3D-printed dosage forms, from a pharmacists' perspective. METHODS Keywords including additive manufacturing, 3D printing and drug delivery were used for literature search in PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) and Web of Science, to identify articles published in the year 2020. RESULTS For each 3DP study, the active pharmaceutical ingredients, 3D printers and materials used for the printing were tabulated and discussed. 3DP has found its applications in various dosage forms for oral delivery, transdermal delivery, rectal delivery, vaginal delivery, implant and bone scaffolding. Several topics were discussed in detail, namely patient-specific dosing, customisable drug administration, multidrug approach, varying drug release, compounding pharmacy, regulatory progress and future perspectives. AM is expected to become a common tool in compounding pharmacies to make polypills and personalised medications. CONCLUSION 3DP is an enabling tool to fabricate dosage forms with intricate structure designs, tailored dosing, drug combinations and controlled release, all of which lend it to be highly conducive to personalisation, thereby revolutionising the future of pharmacy practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1182,35192781,"A qualitative insight into the perceptions and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists.  A qualitative exploration of pharmacists' perceptions regarding COVID-19 conspiracies and their willingness to get vaccinated. A semi-structured questionnaire guide was developed using ground theory to conduct in-depth interviews. A total of 36 participants gave consent for an audio-recorded interview. Results have shown that most of the respondents believed that SARS-CoV-2 is a natural virus, not man-made, that causes a disease just like other viruses and it is absurd to believe that the vaccine is being used by foreign powers for the implantation of microchips just to control humans. A general opinion thatwhich reflected from the in-depth interview is that the pharmaceutical companies may be hiding some important information on COVID-19 to promote the sale of their product. Some doubts on the reliability and trustworthiness on the COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy data were noticed among the respondents. Factors leading to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were adverse reaction, cost of COVID-19 vaccine, and limited data on safety and efficacy profile of COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health professionals is a major hindrance to our current fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this study are alarming, and the stakeholders must consider this ongoing vaccination campaign as an opportunity to formulate a mechanism to ensure high vaccination rate among general public and healthcare providers in Pakistan.KEY POINTSWhat was already known?According to World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is one of the ten major threats to global healthcare system and it is a major barrier to achieve herd immunity around the globe.Pakistan has begun vaccinating its people in a systematic phase-wise manner under which the healthcare workers and elderly people are prioritized for vaccination.Previous experience tells us that vaccine hesitancy is a major problem in Pakistan and it is better to understand perceptions of pharmacists about COVID-19 vaccine who are the primary source of information for most of general population.What this study adds:This study is first of its kind to explore vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists and the results of this study show that majority of the participants were willing to get COVID-19 vaccine and few of them have even got themselves vaccinated at the start of vaccination campaign.Many among the willing participants considered cost of vaccine, adverse reactions, limited data, safety, and efficacy as major hindrance to their decision to get vaccine.Few participants were found highly vaccine-hesitant because of their staunch belief in the prevalent myths and rumors about COVID-19 vaccine.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1183,35192802,"Free-time physical activity and pain perception: An analysis of daily records from Brazilian teachers.  The sensation of pain is frequent in teachers and its relationship with the practice of free-time physical activity still needs more scientific evidence. This study analyzed the association between free-time physical activity and pain symptoms experienced by teachers during the day and at bedtime. In this cross-sectional study, data were obtained through individual interviews and the fulfillment of an activity diary by teachers from a city located in southern Brazil. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and health variables. Among the 141 teachers included, pain perception was reported during the day by 66.7% and at bedtime by 66.0%. Analyses adjusted for sex, age, body mass index and time spent watching television indicated that practicing more than 240 minutes/week of free-time physical activity was associated with a lower likelihood of reported pain during the day (odds ratio, OR=0.18; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.06-0.54) and at bedtime (OR=0.28; 95% CI: 0.10-0.79) compared to practicing ≤60 minutes/week of free-time physical activity. These associations lost statistical significance after the additional adjustment for depressive symptoms. In summary, this study showed that teachers who practiced more than 240 minutes/week of physical activity in free-time were less likely to report pain during the day and at bedtime. Depressive symptoms had an important confounding effect on this association. A multidisciplinary approach can optimize preventive strategies for pain prevention and management through health education programs in the workplace.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1184,35193547,"Overall performance of a drug-drug interaction clinical decision support system: quantitative evaluation and end-user survey. BACKGROUND Clinical decision support systems are implemented in many hospitals to prevent medication errors and associated harm. They are however associated with a high burden of false positive alerts and alert fatigue. The aim of this study was to evaluate a drug-drug interaction (DDI) clinical decision support system in terms of its performance, uptake and user satisfaction and to identify barriers and opportunities for improvement. METHODS A quantitative evaluation and end-user survey were performed in a large teaching hospital. First, very severe DDI alerts generated between 2019 and 2021 were evaluated retrospectively. Data collection comprised alert burden, override rates, the number of alert overrides reviewed by pharmacists and the resulting pharmacist recommendations as well as their acceptance rate. Second, an e-survey was carried out among prescribers to assess satisfaction, usefulness and relevance of DDI alerts as well as reasons for overriding. RESULTS A total of 38,409 very severe DDI alerts were generated, of which 88.2% were overridden by the prescriber. In 3.2% of reviewed overrides, a recommendation by the pharmacist was provided, of which 79.2% was accepted. False positive alerts were caused by a too broad screening interval and lack of incorporation of patient-specific characteristics, such as QTc values. Co-prescribing of a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant and a low molecular weight heparin accounted for 49.8% of alerts, of which 92.2% were overridden. In 88 (1.1%) of these overridden alerts, concurrent therapy was still present. Despite the high override rate, the e-survey revealed that the DDI clinical decision support system was found useful by prescribers. CONCLUSIONS Identified barriers were the lack of DDI-specific screening intervals and inclusion of patient-specific characteristics, both leading to a high number of false positive alerts and risk for alert fatigue. Despite these barriers, the added value of the DDI clinical decision support system was recognized by prescribers. Hence, integration of DDI-specific screening intervals and patient-specific characteristics is warranted to improve the performance of the DDI software.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1185,35194175,"Pharmacogenetic interventions to improve outcomes in patients with multimorbidity or prescribed polypharmacy: a systematic review.  Conventional medicines optimisation interventions in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy are complex and yet limited; a more holistic and integrated approach to healthcare delivery is required. Pharmacogenetics has potential as a component of medicines optimisation. Studies involving multi-medicine pharmacogenetics in adults with multimorbidity or polypharmacy, reporting on outcomes derived from relevant core outcome sets, were included in this systematic review. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarise the data; meta-analysis was inappropriate due to study heterogeneity. Fifteen studies of diverse design and variable quality were included. A small, randomised study involving pharmacist-led medicines optimisation, including pharmacogenetics, suggests this approach could have significant benefits for patients and health systems. However, due to study design heterogeneity and the quality of the included studies, it is difficult to draw generalisable conclusions. Further pragmatic, robust pharmacogenetics studies in diverse, real-world patient populations, are required to establish the benefit of multi-medicine pharmacogenetic screening on patient outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This action research study aimed to develop, implement and evaluate the feasibility of an Islamic-based intervention program that included three main Islamic tenets and concept of family collaboration to promote comprehensive homebound care for Thai-Muslim older adults in southern Thailand. Using action research cycles, interviews with five dyads of healthcare recipients (Thai-Muslim older adults and their family primary caregivers) and with seven Thai-Muslim healthcare professionals (five clinical nurses, a physician and a pharmacist) were undertaken alongside participant observations. Inadequate knowledge, insufficient skills, low family involvement, poor negotiation skills, and the need for better integration of Islamic doctrines were identified. Satisfaction was expressed with the program components and activities, with a qualitative audit data revealed that family primary caregivers felt that they had gained more self-confidence, increased their caregiving knowledge and improved their skills. All stakeholders expressed a desire to further engage and maintain this collaborative program.

1188,35195483,"The impact of advanced age on anticoagulant therapy for acute venous thromboembolism. INTRODUCTION Management of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) has been completely changed after the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). VTE is common in the geriatric population, but the management of DOACs remains complex because of the lack of specific data in this polymedicated fragile population.  An exhaustive search of anticoagulants in the indication of VTE was performed on PubMed, including data from clinical trials, observational studies, real-world data, drug-drug interaction studies, as well as various guidelines from scientific societies. AREAS COVERED The present review aims to summarize our current knowledge on the era of DOACs in the management of VTE in the elderly. This involves learning the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drugs specific to geriatrics, the problem of drug-drug interactions, and the main randomized clinical trials validating the use of DOACs. EXPERT OPINION DOACs have become an essential part of the management of VTE in the elderly, both for their efficacy and safety. However, we are faced with a list of unmet needs, such as the relevance of DOACs in the very elderly, cancer patients, and those with renal impairment.

Cancer patients experience a rising monetary burden due to increased direct and in-direct costs associated with cancer treatment. This as a result has an adverse effect on the financial well-being of a cancer patient, also known as financial toxicity. Currently, there is a lack of literature surrounding the implementation of financial toxicity in post-graduate oncology residency training for pharmacists. The objective of this study was to describe the perceptions of PGY-2 oncology pharmacy residents and residency program directors on the incorporation of financial toxicity within their training programs and to assess self-perceptions of their level of abilities and experience managing financial toxicity for patients.A qualitative RedCap electronic survey was emailed in December 2020 to resident and directors of PGY-2 oncology programs in the United States.Out of 40 respondents, 64% of residency program directors were highly comfortable with the concept of financial toxicity, while 73% of pharmacy residents were uncomfortable with the concept of financial toxicity within their program. Furthermore, a majority of residents were either uncomfortable or highly uncomfortable managing financial toxicity for patients. In addition, the most commonly utilized method of incorporating the concept of financial toxicity in all programs was through specialty pharmacy and patient assistance programs (PAPs); residents also preferred these methods along with guest speakers to provide this training.Financial toxicity concepts should be considered as an educational standard and incorporated through unique methods of education. We suggest introducing the concept through guest speakers, followed by practical applications integrated in specialty pharmacies and PAPs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1190,35197075,"Investigating the knowledge, perception, and practice of healthcare practitioners toward rational use of compounded medications and its contribution to antimicrobial resistance: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Pharmaceutical compounding ensures access of individuals with specific requirements to individualized therapy. However, there is an inconsistency of compounded medication quality. Therefore, advancing the rational use of compounded medication is essential for patient safety and medication effectiveness. OBJECTIVE The presented study was aimed to investigate the healthcare practitioners' knowledge, perception, and practice of extemporaneous compounding and its contribution to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. METHOD A descriptive cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted. The study participants were 300 healthcare practitioners working in Jimma University Medical Center, hospital pharmacies, and community pharmacies in Jimma and Mettu Town, Southwest Ethiopia. RESULTS Most respondents were pharmacists (62.7%) and first-degree holders (48.3%). The majority of them had experience in administering (57.7%), preparing (38%), prescribing (21%), and repackaging and labeling (14%) compounded medications. Commonly they request compounded medications when prepackaged products (77.7%) and needed dosage regimens (72.3%) were not available in the market. However, most of them believed that compounded medications might lack quality (49%) and had poor patient compliance (40.7%). Moreover, they fear that inappropriate preparation processes (75%) and under-dose administration (59%) of compounded medication might contribute to the development and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

Objective To determine community pharmacists' experience with foreign language and American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation services. Design A survey was drafted to gather information about pharmacists' familiarity with ASL and foreign language interpreting services as well as the frequency with which pharmacists encountered patients who needed these services. Setting Independent and chain community pharmacies in Spokane County, Washington, USA. Participants Fifty-two community pharmacies were identified using a provider-credential search. Fifty-one pharmacists (98%) agreed to participate and completed the survey. Interventions Surveys were initially conducted in person, but after the COVID-19 pandemic began data collection was halted and restarted via phone in accordance with the Washington State University Office of Research Support and Operations. Results Four out of 51 pharmacists surveyed (7.84%) indicated that they were fluent in a language besides English. Pharmacists reported encountering patients who spoke Spanish (31%), Russian (31%), ASL (8%), Arabic (5%), Mandarin Chinese (5%), Vietnamese (5%), Marshallese (5%), and Ukrainian (2%). Some pharmacists (8%) reported not encountering patients who spoke other languages besides English. Most pharmacists (72.5%) indicated their company offered interpreting services for foreign languages, but less than half of pharmacists surveyed (43.1%) had experience using these services. Forty-five percent of pharmacists surveyed did not know whether their company offered an interpreting service for ASL, and only 23.5% indicated that they had experience using ASL interpreting services.

Objective To assess a community pharmacist-provided targeted medication review (TMR) intervention to reduce the number of falls risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) prescribed to older patients in a community pharmacy setting. Design A single-site, prospective, interventional pilot study with a historical control group. Setting A single independent community pharmacy in rural Western New York. Participants A convenience sample of subjects was recruited for the intervention group based on the following inclusion criteria: 65 years of age or older, at least one prescription filled at the pharmacy within the past 90 days from date of enrollment in study, enrolled in a local Medicare plan, and prescription for at least one prespecified FRID filled at the pharmacy within 90 days before date of enrollment in study. A control group was collected that had different Medicare Part D plans than the intervention group but otherwise met inclusion criteria and ensured that between all of the control-group patients we included at least one patient prescribed each of the FRID classes that were found in the intervention group. Thirty-six subjects completed the study intervention, and 63 controls were collected. This offset in numbers between groups resulted from intervention subjects taking multiple FRIDs and the control needing to take the same class of FRID, thus one intervention subject may have required multiple control subjects to parallel each FRID class. Intervention The intervention involved the community pharmacist assessing the patient's fall risk, then educating the patient on the risks of the FRID he or she was prescribed, and recommending to either replace or discontinue the FRID. The outcomes assessment occurred three months later, with the pharmacist repeating the falls-risk assessment and following up regarding the patient's agreed-upon action plan. Results The intervention group had 52 FRIDs identified while the control group had 89. The discontinuation rate of FRIDs at three months was significantly higher in the intervention group (7.7% versus 0%; P = 0.0172).

1197,35197658,"Medication Errors and Patient Safety: Evaluation of Physicians' Responses to Medication-Related Alert Overrides in Clinical Decision Support Systems. Background Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can enhance patient safety and reduce medication errors by giving physicians alerts while dispensing medications. Physicians inappropriately override these alerts for various reasons, which can possibly lead to medication errors and impact patient safety. Objective To assess the appropriateness of overridden major medication-related alerts, to investigate the reasons behind inappropriate overriding, and to evaluate if medication errors occur in inappropriately overridden alerts. Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted.. Quantitative: Retrospective observation to evaluate the appropriateness of major drug-dose related alert overrides. A simple random sample was taken from appropriate and inappropriate overrides and reviewed for medication errors. Qualitative: Semi-Structured Interviews were conducted with ten consultant physicians from various specialties. Interviews were transcribed and coded inductively then analyzed using Thematic Content Analysis. Results Out of 1087 alert overrides that were evaluated for appropriateness, 738 were inappropriately overridden (67.89%). In a sample of 283 inappropriate and 92 appropriate overrides; the resulted medication errors were 7 and 0, respectively. Qualitative analysis resulted in three emergent themes; Judgement, Experience & Guidelines, CDSS Issues & Limitations, Physician Behavior & Safety. Conclusion The majority of alerts were found to be inappropriately overridden. This can be attributed to physician reliance on their clinical knowledge and medication databases, having the pharmacists' checks, and alert fatigue. CDSS alerts can be improved by making them more prominent and suppressing or descaling unnecessary alerts. The drop-down justification list can be enhanced by adding free text options and relating recommended dosing to disease or specialty.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1198,35197854,"Buchu (Agathosma betulina and A. crenulata): Rightfully Forgotten or Underutilized?  Today, the term buchu refers to the two species in commerce, Agathosma betulina (P.J.Bergius) Pillans and Agathosma crenulata (L.) Pillans (Rutaceae). Its traditional use in urinary tract infections and related ailments made it a popular remedy, specifically in the US, in 19th century, but with the advent of antibiotics it became largely obsolete. Recent focus is on technological use and on the essential oil for use in the perfume and food-flavouring industry. A review of the scarce pharmacological research revealed moderate antimicrobial activity for a leaf extract but not the essential oil of both species in the MIC assay. In the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) assay the essential oil of both species revealed IC50 values of 50.37 ± 1.87 μg/ml and 59.15 ± 7.44 μg/ml, respectively. In another study 98% inhibitory activity was determined for 250 μg/ml of an ethanolic extract of A. betulina on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and a 25% inhibitory activity on COX-2. Analgesic activity of an ethanolic extract of A. betulina was shown in mice. Moderate antioxidant activity was determined for methanol:dichlormethane extracts of A. betulina and A. crenulata and an aqueous extract of A. betulina showed a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of 11.8 µM Trolox. Recent in vitro studies with a commercial aqueous extract of buchu revealed increased uptake of glucose added to 3T3-L1 cell line, significant inhibition of the respiratory burst of neutrophils and monocytes, reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules and inhibition of the release of IL-6 and TNF-α. In diabetic rats the ingestion of aqueous buchu extract completely normalized the glucose level and in rats receiving a high fat diet the consumption of aqueous buchu extract resulted in less weight gain and less intraperitoneal fat gain as well as reduction of elevated blood pressure to normal associated with cardioprotective effects. Limitations in the hitherto conducted research lie in the undisclosed composition of the buchu extracts used and the difficulty in extrapolating data from animal studies to humans. Health claims for buchu products need to be substantiated by randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies. Only then can they be promoted for their true therapeutic potential.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Devices most frequently requiring counselling were blood glucose monitors, blood pressure monitors, syringes, thermometers, nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, insulin, and weighing scales. The most frequently supplied devices reported were syringes, blood glucose monitors, insulin pens, blood pressure monitors, thermometers, nebulizers, and dry powder inhalers. Devices least frequently requiring counselling were implanted devices, respirometers, and stethoscopes. The least frequently supplied devices were respirometers, implanted devices, and heart rate monitors. Conclusion Medical devices reported to be commonly inquired by patients were most frequently requiring counseling, and most frequently supplied. Findings reflect the availability of devices in the market and pharmacists' response to the needs of their patients. Pharmacists should maintain adequate knowledge about the proper use of medical devices because this is a common patient inquiry.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1201,35198506,"Patients' Satisfaction with the Community Pharmacy Services in Iran. Objective This study aimed to measure patient satisfaction with community pharmacy in Isfahan, Iran, in 2019. Methods In this cross-sectional study (2019), we selected 104 pharmacies located in the second largest city of Iran (Isfahan) based on systematic random sampling and at least five clients at different times of a day who finished the process of obtaining medications from the pharmacies were randomly selected for a short and structured interview using the Persian version of the MacKeigan and Larson questionnaire for measuring patients' satisfaction with pharmacy services. Findings The reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed after distributing 520 among the patients (r = 0.958). No significant difference was observed between sex, marital status, housing status, and total satisfaction score based on the results. In addition, there was a significant difference between educational levels, location, job status, insurance status, real income, and total score of satisfaction (P < 0.05). Our results revealed acceptable satisfaction in some aspects, such as paying attention to pharmacists, the general condition of the pharmacy, and their technical competence. On the other hand, the patients were not satisfied enough in different aspects, for example, counseling, accessibility to their needed drugs, and expenses. Conclusion Patient satisfaction needs to be improved and enhanced in the case of counseling the patients on their medications, and drug accessibility and expenses remain the primary source of dissatisfaction in the studied population, which should be noted by the Iranian Food and Drug Organization and other related authorities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1203,35199580,"Anticipated efficiencies, real costs: Medicaid managed care organizations and the pharmacy benefit.  The Affordable Care Act led an additional 15 states to begin contracting with comprehensive, risk-based managed care organizations (MCOs) to administer pharmacy benefits for Medicaid beneficiaries between 2010 and 2017. Reasons for this shift included concerns about administering complex benefits for an influx of new beneficiaries, assumptions about the cost-saving potential of privately run managed care, and a desire for budget predictability. As drug prices increased during the past decade, the way that state pharmacy benefits were administered via MCOs affected the ability of states to meet the needs of their Medicaid beneficiaries. Here, we review the advantages and limitations of 2 strategies that give states more centralized control over management of the pharmacy benefit: excluding the pharmacy benefit from MCO contracts and aligning preferred drug lists across beneficiary types. We propose that centralizing utilization management tools, aligning incentives for managed care payers with the needs of patients and Medicaid programs, and the ability to implement formulary exclusions may enable states to achieve savings and better meet the needs of beneficiaries.

1204,35200055,"Pharmacists' Knowledge and Perceptions of Health Literacy. BACKGROUND Health literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions. A review of literature revealed few studies that examined pharmacist's knowledge of health literacy. METHODS The Pharmacist Professional Health Literacy Survey was distributed to a convenience sampling of community pharmacists in medically underserved counties of Southwest Georgia. RESULTS Of 75 pharmacists contacted, 39 completed the survey and were used in the evaluation. Most respondents reported no health literacy training and had never assessed health literacy with a validated questionnaire. More than half of the participants cited lack of knowledge about low health literacy as a major barrier to implementing health literacy screening for their patients. Time and cost were identified as major barriers to participating in health literacy training programs. CONCLUSION Most pharmacists from this area had little exposure to evaluating health literacy. Pharmacy education postgraduate programs and continuing education training programs around this topic will heighten health literacy knowledge for the pharmacy profession. There is a need for a quick, easy to use, and effective tool for pharmacists to recognize and assess health literacy in patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1205,35200057,"Early Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in Community Pharmacies-CRIFAFARMA Study. BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia to appear in clinical practice. People with AF have 5 times the risk of stroke compared to the general population. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the prevalence of AF in people over the age of 50 without known AF, who presented to a community pharmacy to check their cardiovascular risk factors, to identify risk factors associated with AF, and to assess the risk of stroke in people who screened positive for AF. METHODS A multicenter observational descriptive study of a screening program took place from May to December 2016. A blood pressure monitor (Microlife Watch BP Home) was used to screen for AF, and the CHA2DS2-VASc questionnaire was used to assess stroke risk. RESULTS The study included 452 adults over the age of 50. The CRIFAFARMA study detected a prevalence of AF of 9.1%. Risk factors for AF were: age of 75 years or older (P = .024), lack of physical activity (P = .043), diabetes (P < .001), dyslipidemia (P = .003), and history of cardiovascular disease (P = .003). Diabetes (OR 2.79, P = .005) and dyslipidemia (OR 2.16, P = .031) had a combined explanatory capacity in the multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age. 85% were at high risk of stroke according to the CHA2DS2-VASc scale.

This was a case of an 81-year-old female, an amputee, who presented at hospital with a fractured neck of femur after a fall in the nursing home. The patient was being treated for several complex chronic conditions for which 30 regular medicines were prescribed and 100 tablets were being taken per day. The patient was fluid limited to 1500 mL per day but the need to swallow such a high number of tablets meant that there was no fluid allowance available for any other drinks, not even a cup of tea. In the nursing home, the patient had multiple prescribers, not all from the one surgery. The pharmacist conducted a multifaceted review of the patient's medication and lifestyle factors. Working collaboratively with the wider health care team, the intervention was able to reduce the number of medications and improve the patient's quality of life through improving the effectiveness of other lifestyle factors. This case not only showcases pharmacist interventions but also the synergistic benefit of interprofessional working with patients with chronic and complex conditions.

Pharmacists must be able to navigate prescription drug coverages to help providers and patients reduce out-of-pocket costs. Traditionally, curricula on drug insurance benefits rely on lectures and lack a practicum that offers students hands-on experience with determining formulary and cost-sharing information. An activity for pharmacy students to update a free public website that summarizes formularies and copayment requirements across major insurers was piloted. Pharmacy students were trained to locate online formularies and identify a drug's coverage tier, step therapy, prior authorization, and cost-sharing during a 6-week experiential rotation. Students checked formularies from six insurance plans for 250-plus drugs across 15 health conditions. Graduates were surveyed (74% response rate) about the activities' impact on their learning and ability to navigate drug benefits. Respondents rated the training as helpful in learning whether a drug was covered (100%), or required step therapy or prior authorization (100%). The majority of graduates reported being able to look up formulary coverage (90%), step therapy or prior authorization (90%), and copayment requirements (65%).

1210,35202073,"Protocol for the Optimizing Naloxone Dispensing in Pharmacies (ONDP) Online Continuing Education Program: A Randomized Controlled Trial.  The number of opioid-related deaths in Canada has steadily increased since 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened this trend. Naloxone has been pivotal for reducing opioid-related harms and death, and pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring the supply of naloxone to Canadians through community pharmacies. However, naloxone dispensing by pharmacists is not optimal; in fact, in Ontario, only 50% of pharmacists offer naloxone, despite national guidelines that pharmacists should offer naloxone to everyone with an opioid prescription. When asked why pharmacists do not proactively offer naloxone, recent research has identified that pharmacists need continuing education to boost confidence and knowledge on how to start conversations with patients. The study involves a delayed start, double-blind randomized controlled trial, for Canadian licensed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. The goals of the program are to increase Canadian pharmacy professional's knowledge, confidence, and motivation to proactively offer naloxone, as well as to decrease stigma associated with naloxone. The program incorporates behaviour change techniques from the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The intervention program includes three modules that focus on improving pharmacists' communication skills by teaching them how to proactively offer naloxone, while the control group will complete a reading assignment on the naloxone consensus guidelines. The program will involve a process and outcome evaluation in addition to a contribution analysis. This program is important for breaking down previously identified barriers and knowledge gaps for why pharmacists currently do not proactively offer naloxone. This study will provide important new information about what behaviour change techniques are successful in improving confidence and motivation in the pharmacy profession and in an online environment.

Reflective practice is important in pharmacy education to support skill development for decision-making, critical thinking, problem-solving, and in continuing professional development and beyond. Despite the importance of reflective practice in higher education and professional practice, reflection assignments are not universally embraced by students. This project was initiated due to recent interest in the co-creation of pharmacy curriculum by students and faculty. The purpose of this project was to develop reflection assignments for pharmacy students. The principles of the analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation (ADDIE) instructional design framework guided the development of reflection assignment templates for three focus areas: personal development, professional development, and professional identity formation. Templates included background and definitions for these specific focus areas as well as objectives, instructions, guiding questions, assessment methods, and submission requirements. A previously tested assessment rubric was adopted for reflection assignments. Development involved target audience and expert reviews and a trial implementation was held in a year 3 patient care skills course.

1213,35202078,"Towards Better CARE for Superficial Fungal Infections: A Consultation Guide for the Community Pharmacy.  Superficial fungal infections (SFIs) are among the most common skin diseases worldwide and are common in many parts of Asia. Community pharmacists are well-placed to help identify and manage SFIs. However, effective management may be hindered by a suboptimal consultation process, attributed to the misalignment between consumers' and pharmacists' viewpoints. The Fungal CARE (Care, Assess, Recommend, Empower) guide, a patient-centered collaborative framework, was developed to improve pharmacist-led SFI consultations in community pharmacy. A survey on real-world consumer experiences with SFIs provided insights for aligning the Fungal CARE guide with consumer perspectives. To further optimize the guide, community pharmacists were surveyed on their current practice and challenges of managing SFIs, as well as views on the usefulness of the Fungal CARE guide. The pharmacists' survey indicated that respondents engaged with some but not all of consumers' top concerns with SFIs, such as emotional and social aspects. Pharmacists identified their greatest challenges as poor compliance with SFI treatment and limited confidence in identifying and/or managing SFIs. Encouragingly, when presented with the Fungal CARE guide, nearly all pharmacists agreed it would be helpful and would use it in practice. Implementing the Fungal CARE guide may help improve pharmacist-led consultations for SFIs and encourage better treatment outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

To graduate, pharmacy technician students write a project in their third year. They choose between six elective courses, and work with a subject related to their education and everyday practice at community or hospital pharmacies. In this article, we report the mapping of third-year project themes and provide an overview of the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have had on completing the projects. On the basis of all project titles, a list of themes was generated and described before all projects were allocated to one of the themes. Challenges experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated from an analytical workshop where supervisors discussed their experience with supervising students throughout the completion of the projects. In total, 140 projects were included and thematised into eight themes: advanced pharmacy services, digital patient support, organisation and collaboration, handling of medicine, automated dose dispensing, medication counselling in community pharmacy, hospital pharmacy, and others, covering all six elective courses. The COVID-19 pandemic affected students' possibilities to collect data from either physical interviews or observations. The challenges prompted both constructive and creative discussions between students and supervisors to find ways to complete the projects, and required flexibility from all those involved: students, supervisors, community pharmacies, and hospital pharmacies.

However, there is a research gap in the role of pharmacists as antimicrobial stewards in Malaysia. This study aimed to explore hospital pharmacists' perspectives on their roles in, and barriers and facilitators to the implementation of AMS strategies. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 hospital pharmacists involved in AMS activities from 13 public hospitals in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo software version 10.0 (QSR). A thematic analysis method was used to identify themes from the qualitative data until theme saturation was reached. Respondents perceived pharmacists as having important roles in the implementation of AMS strategies, in view of the multiple tasks they were entrusted with. They described their functions as antimicrobial advisors, antimicrobial guardians and liaison personnel. The lack of resources in terms of training, manpower and facilities, as well as attitudinal challenges, were some barriers identified by the respondents. Administrative support, commitment and perseverance were found to be facilitators to the role of pharmacists in AMS. In conclusion, pharmacists in public hospitals play important roles in AMS teams.

The scope of pharmacogenomics in improving health outcomes and the quality of health care is well-known. Implementation of such initiatives requires adequate knowledge, perception, and positive attitudes among pharmacists. A study was conducted on pharmacy students at King Saud University in Riyadh to analyze their attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions concerning pharmacogenomics to explore the feasibility of establishing full-time pharmacogenomics instruction and services. A cross-sectional study was carried out in one of the significant pharmacy schools of Saudi Arabia, using a simple questionnaire-based survey in pharmacy students pursuing Bpharm and PharmD courses to obtain preliminary information about pharmacogenomics among the surveyed population. The study's secondary objective was to determine the perceived belief about pharmacogenomics implementation in clinical practice. Out of the total of 552 participants, 41.8% correctly defined pharmacogenomics and 81.3% understood that genetic change could lead to adverse reactions. More than half of the participants agreed that the FDA recommends pharmacogenomics testing for certain drugs. The knowledge about a year of use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice was found to be very low; only 15.2% could correctly answer. Only 60% of students agreed on pharmacogenomics testing for selecting the therapy with the most negligible adverse effects. Due to the limited knowledge about and understanding of pharmacogenomics, there is a lack of interest among pharmacy students in implementing pharmacogenomics testing in clinical practice. Our study highlights the need for improving pharmacy students' knowledge about pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics so that the implementation of pharmacogenomics testing in clinical practice will become easier. There is a need to introduce an up-to-date curriculum for pharmacy courses other pharmacogenomics-based health education programs in Saudi Arabia.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1226,35206255,"The Influence of the Pharmacists' Training on the Quality and Comprehensiveness of Professional Advice Given in the Field of Inhalation Techniques in Community Pharmacies in Poland. BACKGROUND Following the example of other countries, it is very important to educate patients on the correct use of inhalers by properly trained healthcare professionals, including pharmacists. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to assess the quality and comprehensiveness of professional advice given by pharmacists on the use of inhalers, which was determined by the pharmacists' level of training. METHODS The study was conducted from June 2019 to March 2020. 150 pharmacists from Poznan and Warsaw (Poland) were involved. Before the study began, the professional education of 240 pharmacists was conducted in Warsaw to implement standard operating procedures. The study used the model of a mystery shopper. RESULTS The conversation with a trained pharmacist lasted on average 5.5 min, with an untrained one-3.0 min (p < 0.0001). Placebo inhalers were used more often by trained pharmacists during patients' education (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 10.3% of untrained pharmacists did not provide any education. Additionally, untrained employees' quality of advice was assessed on an average of 3.5 points, while trained ones-7.6 points (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS This study has shown that there is a need for professional training among pharmacists in Poland, which translates into better patient education in the field of inhalation techniques.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1227,35206894,"A Video-Based Reflective Design to Prepare First Year Pharmacy Students for Their First Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).  We explored the use of a video-based reflective design in preparing first-year pharmacy students for their Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in Victoria, Australia. This involved pre-workshop activities (a recording of themselves simulating the pharmacist responding to a simple primary care problem, written reflection, review of the OSCE video examples and pre-workshop survey); workshop activities (peer feedback on videos) and post-workshop activities (summative MCQ quiz and post-workshop survey). These activities took place three weeks before their OSCE. A mixed-method study design was employed with quantitative and qualitative analyses of the surveys and a focus group. A total of 137 students (77.4%) completed the pre- and post-workshop surveys, and ten students participated in the focus group. More student participants (54%) reported feeling prepared for the OSCE post-workshop than pre-workshop (13%). The majority (92%) agreed that filming, watching and reflecting on their video allowed them to learn and improve on their skills for the OSCE. The regression analysis found that video recording submissions and written reflections correlated positively with student OSCE performances, and the video-based reflective design learning experience was perceived to be beneficial in multiple ways. Thematic analysis of the focus group data revealed that students acquired metacognitive skills through the self-assessment of their video recordings, developed an awareness of their learning and were able to identify learning strategies to prepare for their first OSCE. Fostering students' feedback literacy could be considered in future educational designs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1228,35206900,"Pharmacy Student Perceptions of a Virtual Pharmacogenomics Activity.  Pharmacogenomics (PGx) utilizes a patient's genome to guide drug treatment and dosing. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) included PGx as a critical content area. Pharmacists are increasingly involved in providing this service, which necessitates training. Second-year pharmacy students at Samford University McWhorter School of Pharmacy have didactic training in the principles of PGx and managing drug therapy using PGx data. A clinical skills lab activity was developed to reinforce these principles and allow students to navigate resources to develop and communicate recommendations for drug therapy. The activity was initially planned as synchronous, but transitioned to asynchronous when students began remote learning in the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators sought students' perceptions of the PGx lab activity and the delivery of its content via a virtual format. This study gathered data from an anonymous, voluntary student survey through Samford University's course management system, Canvas, in the spring of 2020 soon after completion of the virtual PGx learning activity. The investigators' goal is to obtain the information and insights obtained from the students who participated in the PGx lab activity to provide guidance for the improvement of their PGx lab activity and for other schools of pharmacy to deliver a PGx lab activities using nontraditional teaching methodologies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1229,35206942,"Students' and Examiners' Experiences of Their First Virtual Pharmacy Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in Australia during the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are routinely used in healthcare education programs. Traditionally, students undertake OSCEs as face-to-face interactions to assess competency in soft skills. Due to physical distancing restrictions during COVID-19, alternative methods were required. This study utilized a mixed-method design (online survey and interviews) to evaluate second-year pharmacy students' and examiners' experiences of their first virtual OSCEs in Australia. A total of 196 students completed their first virtual OSCE in June 2020 of which 190 students completed the online survey. However, out of the 190 students, only 88% (n = 167) consented to the use of the data from their online survey. A further 10 students and 12 examiners were interviewed. Fifty-five students (33%) who participated in the online survey strongly agreed or agreed that they preferred the virtual experience to face-to-face OSCEs while 44% (n = 73) neither agreed nor disagreed. Only 20% (n = 33) felt more anxious with the virtual OSCEs. Additionally, thematic analysis found non-verbal communication as a barrier during the OSCE. Positive aspects about virtual OSCEs included flexibility, decreased levels of anxiety and relevance with emerging telehealth practice. The need for remote online delivery of assessments saw innovative ways of undertaking OSCEs and an opportunity to mimic telehealth. While students and examiners embraced the virtual OSCE process, face-to-face OSCEs were still considered important and irreplaceable. Future opportunities for OSCEs to be delivered both face-to-face and virtually should be considered.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1230,35207803,"Understanding the Risks and Benefits of a Patient Portal Configured for HIV Care: Patient and Healthcare Professional Perspectives. BACKGROUND Like other chronic viral illnesses, HIV infection necessitates consistent self-management and adherence to care and treatment, which in turn relies on optimal collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs), including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and clinical care coordinators. By providing people living with HIV (PLHIV) with access to their personal health information, educational material, and a communication channel with HCPs, a tailored patient portal could support their engagement in care. Our team intends to implement a patient portal in HIV-specialized clinics in Canada and France. We sought to understand the perceived risks and benefits among PLHIV and HCPs of patient portal use in HIV clinical care. METHODS This qualitative study recruited PLHIV and HIV-specialized HCPs, through maximum variation sampling and purposeful sampling, respectively. Semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs) were held separately with PLHIV and HCPs between August 2019 and January 2020. FGDs were recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 12 software, and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS A total of twenty-eight PLHIV participated in four FGDs, and thirty-one HCPs participated in six FGDs. PLHIV included eighteen men, nine women, and one person identifying as other; while, HCPs included ten men, twenty women, and one person identifying as other. A multi-disciplinary team of HCPs were included, involving physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and clinical coordinators. Participants identified five potential risks: (1) breach of confidentiality, (2) stress or uncertainty, (3) contribution to the digital divide, (4) dehumanization of care, and (5) increase in HCPs' workload. They also highlighted four main benefits of using a patient portal: (1) improvement in HIV self-management, (2) facilitation of patient visits, (3) responsiveness to patient preferences, and (4) fulfillment of current or evolving patient needs. CONCLUSION PLHIV and HCPs identified both risks and benefits of using a patient portal in HIV care. By engaging stakeholders and understanding their perspectives, the configuration of a patient portal can be optimized for end-users and concerns may be mitigated during its implementation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1231,35208544,"Impact of Hospitalization in an Endocrinology Department on Vaccination Coverage in People Living with Diabetes: A Real-Life Study.  Background and Objectives: Vaccination coverage is suboptimal in people living with diabetes. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of hospitalization on vaccination coverage and the variables associated with vaccination during hospital stay. Materials and Methods: This observational study was conducted from May 2019 to December 2019 in the Endocrinology-Nutrition-Diabetes Department of the University Hospital of Montpellier, France. This department encompasses three medical units, two of which have a full-time clinical pharmacist involved in the multidisciplinary management of patients. All adult diabetic patients who completed a questionnaire about vaccines were prospectively included by a clinical pharmacist and followed until department discharge. Coverage at the time of admission for the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap), pneumococcal, influenza, and herpes zoster vaccines was assessed from patient interviews and/or contact with the general practitioner and/or with the community pharmacist. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with a vaccination update during the hospital stay. Results: A total of 222 patients were included (mean age: 59.4 years, 68.5% type 2 diabetes). Vaccination coverage increased by 26.7% (47.3% to 59.9%), 188.0% (10.8% to 31.1%) and 8.9% (45.9% to 50.0%), respectively, for the Tdap, pneumococcal and influenza vaccines during hospital stay. Female sex, admission to a diabetes care unit with a full-time pharmacist, favorable feelings about vaccination, unknown immunization coverage for pneumococcal vaccines, and evaluation and recording of vaccine coverage at admission in the patient medical records were associated with at least one vaccination during hospital stay. Conclusions: Our real-life study highlights that hospitalization and multidisciplinary management (i.e., physician-pharmacist) may be key points in the diabetes care pathway to improve vaccination coverage, especially for patients with advanced diabetes and comorbidities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1232,35209830,"Event Monitoring and Evaluation by Community Pharmacists in Japan: A Pilot study on Fenofibrate and Pemafibrate. BACKGROUND The Japan Pharmaceutical Association has conducted drug event monitoring to detect drug-related events related to pemafibrate. A pilot study evaluating the association between drug use and detected events was performed in Japan, as there are few studies on the safety of pemafibrate in clinical settings. AIM We investigated the association between detected events and pemafibrate, utilizing pharmacy records maintained by community pharmacists. We identified the new-user cohort comprising a test and active comparison drug and collected baseline information. An active comparison group comprising new users was used to assess the events. METHOD A retrospective cohort study using questionnaires on baseline and event data was conducted by community pharmacists belonging to the Japan Pharmaceutical Association. The incidence of event and estimated hazard ratio were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model that was adjusted for confounding factors, such as age and sex. RESULTS A total of 1294 patients using pemafibrate and 508 patients using fenofibrate were identified as new drug users. The most reported events for suspected adverse reactions and add-on drugs were increased blood pressure and lipid-lowering drugs with pemafibrate use, and nasopharyngitis, pruritus, dizziness, and lipid-lowering drug with fenofibrate use. No significant differences were found for common events, except for an add-on of an anti-hypertensive for pemafibrate compared with fenofibrate. CONCLUSION Although further study is needed, this study by pharmacists can facilitate the safety assessment of newly marketed drugs, as few drug use investigations with a comparator are carried out by the Japanese authority for pharmaceutical companies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1233,35210962,"Retracted publications in pharmacy systematic reviews. Objective Systematic reviews and other evidence syntheses, the pinnacle of the evidence pyramid, embody comprehensiveness and rigor; however, retracted data are being incorporated into these publications. This study examines the use of retracted publications in the field of pharmacy, describes characteristics of retracted publications cited by systematic reviews, and discusses factors associated with citation likelihood. Methods Using data from Retraction Watch, we identified retracted publications in the pharmacy field. We identified all articles citing these retracted publications in Web of Science and Scopus and limited results to systematic reviews. We classified the retraction reason, determined whether the citation occurred before or after retraction, and analyzed factors associated with the likelihood of systematic reviews citing a retracted publication. Results Of 1,396 retracted publications, 283 were cited 1,096 times in systematic reviews. Most (65.0%) (712/1096) citations occurred before retraction. Citations were most often to items retracted due to data falsification or manipulation (39.2%), followed by items retracted due to ethical misconduct including plagiarism (30.4%), or concerns about or errors in data or methods (26.2%). Compared to those not cited in systematic reviews, cited items were significantly more likely to be retracted due to data falsification and manipulation, were published in high impact factor journals, and had longer delays between publication and retraction. Conclusions Further analysis of systematic reviews citing retracted publications is needed to determine the impact of flawed data.

1234,35210972,"Implementation of the cognitive apprenticeship model for enhancement of advanced searching skills in a pharmacy academia rotation. Background Pharmacy students are primarily taught literature searching skills didactically during their Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum. To effect change in the area of advanced literature searching skills, a pharmacy librarian joined with two Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) preceptors to design and implement a crash course on applied systematic searching skills for a cohort of four students. Case Presentation Through the cognitive apprenticeship model, a Systematic Searching Crash Course (SSCC) was implemented among a cohort of four academic APPE students. Students developed search strategies using controlled vocabulary and free text, translated their searches into multiple databases, and used citation management software to build libraries of evidence. Additionally, the cohort blindly peer reviewed each other's search strategies, wrote literature reviews, and finally conducted a search together without input from the pharmacy librarian. Conclusions Review of the pre-/post-course self-assessment taken by the cohort indicates the SSCC is a success in terms of improving student confidence in accessing and synthesizing primary literature. As the crash course is further refined and implemented, there may be more opportunity to embed the course into didactic curriculum and residency programs and to potentially reproduce it for other health science disciplines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: A successful antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is sustained through improving antimicrobial prescribing by changing prescribing behavior. This requires a better understanding of hospital stakeholders' views regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR), antimicrobial use and participation in ASP activities. Objectives: Identify perceptions and attitudes among physicians and pharmacists in a public hospital toward AMR, prescription and ASP. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 45 items was distributed to physicians and pharmacists in a 320-bed public hospital. All responses were formatted into the Likert scale. Results: A total of 78 respondents (73% response rate) completed the questionnaire. The majority of the respondents perceived AMR within hospital as less of a severe problem, and factors outside hospital were considered to be greater contributors to AMR.

1238,35213107,"Knowledge and attitude of medical students toward self-medication. BACKGROUND Self-medication is promoted in many countries for several reasons such as prevention of simple diseases and symptoms, provision of rapid treatment, simpler health system diseases, and reduction of doctor's examination fees in health funds. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge and attitude of self-medication among medical students in Tikrit University. SUBJECT AND MATERIAL A cross-sectional study was conducted at Tikrit University College of Medicine from December 15, 2017 to March 15, 2018. The sample consisted of 225 students, out of which 113 were males and 112 were females. Samples were selected in a stratified, random sampling design from all stages of the college. The data were collected using a questionnaire which was administered by interviewers and email. RESULTS About 81.3% of the medical students who enrolled in the study used self-medications. The frequency of self-medication among the clinical stages was higher than the basic stages. Headache (92%) was the common reason for self-medication practice among people, followed by fever (64%) and common cold (58.6%), according to the opinion of the medical students. Doctors' advice was the main source of information that the students (64%) depended on, followed by advice from pharmacists (47.5%). Most of the respondents had poor knowledge (72.8%), but more than half of the students had a positive attitude (67.25%) toward self-medication. CONCLUSION Countless understudies were distinguished to rehearse self-medicine, and a large portion of the respondents had helpless information; however, they had a great demeanor about self-prescription. Commonness of self-medication drug increments as year of study increments. This might be because of expanded review openness to illnesses and prescriptions. Hence, it is unequivocally suggested for raising the issue of direction to edify the understudies about the issues that might emerge from unseemly drug use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1239,35213293,"Study protocol for the Respond to Prevent Study: a multi-state randomized controlled trial to improve provision of naloxone, buprenorphine and nonprescription syringes in community pharmacies.  Access to the opioid antidote naloxone is a critical component of addressing the opioid crisis. Naloxone is a population-level prevention intervention associated with substantial reductions in overdose mortality and reduction of nonfatal overdose. Pharmacies' pivotal role in dispensing medications like buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder and selling nonprescription syringes places them at the crossroads of opioid access and risk mitigation methods like naloxone provision. Testing ways to optimize pharmacy-based naloxone provision will be key as the country expands the implementation of naloxone through the medical system. In the Respond to Prevent Study, we conducted a large, practical study of a pharmacy-focused intervention in a sample of Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts and New Hampshire community chain pharmacies to increase naloxone dispensing and improve opioid safety. The intervention integrated two evidence-based educational toolkits and streamlined materials to enhance the focus on naloxone policy, stigma reduction, and patient communications around naloxone, nonprescription syringes and buprenorphine access. The real-world study implemented a stepped wedge, clustered randomized trial design across 175 community chain pharmacies to evaluate the effectiveness of the Respond to Prevent intervention in increasing: (a) pharmacy based naloxone distribution rates, naloxone-related patient engagement, and pharmacist and technicians' attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy toward naloxone; and (b) pharmacy nonprescription syringe sales, and pharmacist and technicians' attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy toward dispensing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (secondary outcomes).

1240,35213469,"Pilot Findings of Pharmacogenomics in Perioperative Care: Initial Results From the First Phase of the ImPreSS Trial. BACKGROUND Pharmacogenomics, which offers a potential means by which to inform prescribing and avoid adverse drug reactions, has gained increasing consideration in other medical settings but has not been broadly evaluated during perioperative care. METHODS The Implementation of Pharmacogenomic Decision Support in Surgery (ImPreSS) Trial is a prospective, single-center study consisting of a prerandomization pilot and a subsequent randomized phase. We describe findings from the pilot period. Patients planning elective surgeries were genotyped with pharmacogenomic results, and decision support was made available to anesthesia providers in advance of surgery. Pharmacogenomic result access and prescribing records were analyzed. Surveys (Likert-scale) were administered to providers to understand utilization barriers. RESULTS Of eligible anesthesiology providers, 166 of 211 (79%) enrolled. A total of 71 patients underwent genotyping and surgery (median, 62 years; 55% female; average American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, 2.6; 58 inpatients and 13 ambulatories). No patients required postoperative intensive care or pain consultations. At least 1 provider accessed pharmacogenomic results before or during 41 of 71 surgeries (58%). Faculty were more likely to access results (78%) compared to house staff (41%; P = .003) and midlevel practitioners (15%) (P < .0001). Notably, all administered intraoperative medications had favorable genomic results with the exception of succinylcholine administration to 1 patient with genomically increased risk for prolonged apnea (without adverse outcome). Considering composite prescribing in preoperative, recovery, throughout hospitalization, and at discharge, each patient was prescribed a median of 35 (range 15-83) total medications, 7 (range 1-22) of which had annotated pharmacogenomic results. Of 2371 prescribing events, 5 genomically high-risk medications were administered (all tramadol or omeprazole; with 2 of 5 pharmacogenomic results accessed), and 100 genomically cautionary mediations were administered (hydralazine, oxycodone, and pantoprazole; 61% rate of accessing results). Providers reported that although results were generally easy to access and understand, the most common reason for not considering results was because remembering to access pharmacogenomic information was not yet a part of their normal clinical workflow. CONCLUSIONS Our pilot data for result access rates suggest interest in pharmacogenomics by anesthesia providers, even if opportunities to alter prescribing in response to high-risk genotypes were infrequent. This pilot phase has also uncovered unique considerations for implementing pharmacogenomic information in the perioperative care setting, and new strategies including adding the involvement of surgery teams, targeting patients likely to need intensive care and dedicated pain care, and embedding pharmacists within rounding models will be incorporated in the follow-on randomized phase to increase engagement and likelihood of affecting prescribing decisions and clinical outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1241,35213897,"[Drug Therapy Safety in Outpatient Care Services]. INTRODUCTION Due to frequent multi-medication, older people are particularly vulnerable to adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which increase hospitalisation and mortality rates. If specially trained pharmacists and nursing staff assume more responsibility in the use of medicines by the elderly, risks can be avoided. METHODS A voluntary survey was conducted with care managers of ambulatory care services using a predefined survey questionnaire, and the medicines stored and provided were examined. RESULTS Medicines were stored in 76% of the 104 ambulatory care services surveyed. In 63% of these, medicines in stock were examined, and in 55% a comparison was made between prescribed and provided medicines. Deficiencies were found in about half of the inspected boxes and dosettes. On average, 1.5 errors were found per checked unit; 40% of the nursing services left the medicines in the vehicle for 3 to 6 hours when transporting them to the client. Regular meetings with doctors' practices or pharmacies were conducted by less than 35% of the these services. In 41 out of the 104 services surveyed, investigators monitoring therapy rated the performance of the nursing staff positively. CONCLUSIONS Therapy monitoring and cooperation of ambulatory care services with other health professionals, especially with pharmacists, needs to be improved. More care and control (e. g., through the four-eyes principle) should be exercised, especially in the provision of medicines. In future, further precisely conducted and representative surveys on medication processes in outpatient care need to be carried out. Analogous to existing studies, there were indications of quality and communication problems as well as weaknesses in therapy monitoring in ambulatory care services. Sources of error were mainly found in storage and transport of medicines. Errors were also evident in the provision of medicines. Due to the lack of participation obligations, the results of the study are limited.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1242,35214052,"Performance of Tablet Splitters, Crushers, and Grinders in Relation to Personalised Medication with Tablets.  Swallowing problems and the required dose adaptations needed to obtain optimal pharmacotherapy may be a hurdle in the use of tablets in daily clinical practice. Tablet splitting, crushing, or grinding is often applied to personalise medication, especially for the elderly and children. In this study, the performance of different types of (commercially available) devices was studied. Included were splitters, screwcap crushers, manual grinders, and electric grinders. Unscored tablets without active ingredient were prepared, with a diameter of 9 and 13 mm and a hardness of 100-220 N. Tablets were split into two parts and the difference in weight was measured. The time needed to pulverise the tablets (crush time) was recorded. The residue remaining in the device (loss) was measured. The powder was sieved to obtain a particle fraction >600 µm and <600 µm. The median particle size and particle size distribution of the later fraction were determined using laser diffraction analysis. Splitting tablets into two equal parts appeared to be difficult with the devices tested. Most screwcap grinders yielded a coarse powder containing larger chunks. Manual and especially electric grinders produced a finer powder, making it suitable for administration via an enteral feeding tube as well as for use in individualised preparations such as capsules. In conclusion, for domestic and incidental use, a screwcap crusher may provide sufficient size reduction, while for the more demanding regular use in hospitals and nursing residences, a manual or electric grinder is preferred.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined whether funding maternal pertussis vaccination in community pharmacy increases its uptake. Pertussis vaccination during pregnancy was compared between non-contiguous, demographically similar regions of NZ. The pertussis vaccine was funded at pharmacies from Nov 2016 in one NZ region (Waikato), but not in comparator regions (Northland, Hawkes Bay). Vaccinations during pregnancy were determined from the National Immunisation Register, general practice and pharmacy claims data, and a maternity database. Comparisons were made using adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Nov 2015 to Oct 2016 versus Nov 2016 to Oct 2019. The odds of pregnancy pertussis vaccination increased in the post-intervention versus pre-intervention period with this increase being larger (p = 0.0014) in the intervention (35% versus 21%, OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.89-2.27) versus the control regions (38% versus 26%, OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.52-1.84). Coverage was lower for Māori versus non-Māori, but increased more for Māori in the intervention versus control regions (117% versus 38% increase).

1244,35215255,"Medicines Reconciliation in the Emergency Department: Important Prescribing Discrepancies between the Shared Medication Record and Patients' Actual Use of Medication.  Medication reconciliation is crucial to prevent medication errors. In Denmark, primary and secondary care physicians can prescribe medication in the same electronic prescribing system known as the Shared Medication Record (SMR). However, the SMR is not always updated by physicians, which can lead to discrepancies between the SMR and patients' actual use of medication. These discrepancies may compromise patient safety upon admission to the emergency department (ED). Here, we investigated (a) the occurrence of discrepancies, (b) factors associated with discrepancies, and (c) the percentage of patients accessible to a clinical pharmacist during pharmacy working hours. The study included all patients age ≥ 18 years who were admitted to the Hvidovre Hospital ED on three consecutive days in June 2020. The clinical pharmacists performed medicines reconciliation to identify prescribing discrepancies. In total, 100 patients (52% male; median age 66.5 years) were included. The patients had a median of 10 [IQR 7-13] medications listed in the SMR and a median of two [IQR 1-3.25] discrepancies. Factors associated with increased rate of prescribing discrepancies were age < 65 years, time since last update of the SMR ≥ 115 days, and patients' self-dispensing their medications. Eighty-four percent of patients were available for medicines reconciliations during the normal working hours of the clinical pharmacist. In conclusion, we found that discrepancies between the SMR and patients' actual medication use upon admission to the ED are frequent, and we identified several risk factors associated with the increased rate of discrepancies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1246,35218217,"Identification of drug-related problems followed by clinical pharmacist interventions in an outpatient pharmacotherapy clinic. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Pharmacotherapy is an essential strategy for the treatment of many medical conditions especially chronic disease and often involves multiple medications being used simultaneously. Increasing the use of medications may pose some challenges to safe and effective drug therapy and if not identified and prevented by the pharmacists eventually can lead to drug-related problems (DRPs). The present study aimed to examine the incidence of DRPs in Iranian patients and to evaluate patients' adherence to the clinical pharmacist interventions as well as the physicians' acceptance of these recommendations. METHODS This study was conducted in a university-affiliated outpatient pharmacotherapy clinic over a 22-month period. Patients aged 18 years and older with at least one chronic disease receiving at least four medications were included in the study. The patients were interviewed by a clinical pharmacist for comprehensive medication review. DRPs were identified using the DOCUMENT classification system. Recommendations were provided by the clinical pharmacist including interventions involving patient and/or physician to resolve DRPs. The patients were followed up after 2 weeks to evaluate their compliance and physician acceptance of clinical pharmacist recommendations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Two hundred patients were included in this study. Overall, 875 DRPs were identified with an average of 4.37 per patient. The most prevalent DRPs were related to patient education or information (22.8%), undertreated indications (17.4%) and patient compliance (17.2%). The most common drugs associated with DRPs were alimentary and metabolism (22.2% of DRPs) followed by the cardiovascular system (19.2%) and nervous system (9.6%) medications. The DRP incidence correlated with gender only and was higher in females (p = 0.019). The clinical pharmacist provided 912 interventions with an average of 4.56 and 1.04 interventions per patient and per DRPs respectively. Patient education (41.3%), medication initiation or discontinuation (24.5%), and non-pharmacological interventions (12.9%) were the most common clinical pharmacist interventions. Out of 912 interventions, 665 were followed up, out of which 427 were patient dependent and 228 involved physicians. The patient's compliance with clinical pharmacist recommendations was 81.2%. The physician acceptance rate of the recommendations was 44.1%. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The study shows that especially designed services such as pharmacotherapy clinics running by clinical pharmacists are necessary to detect and resolve DRPs in an effective way. The high compliance rate of the patients indicates patients' confidence in the clinical pharmacist services provided in the pharmacotherapy clinic. The low acceptance rate of the physicians highlights the need to improve interprofessional collaboration between clinical pharmacists and physicians in an outpatient setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1247,35218218,"Implementation assessment of a patient personalized clinical pharmacy programme (5P project) into orthogeriatric care pathway. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE The orthogeriatric path (hip-fractured elderly patients) is composed of several transition points (emergency surgery, orthopaedic, geriatric and rehabilitation units). The intervention of clinical pharmacists can ensure the continuity of patients' drug management during their hospital stay. The aim of the study was to assess the implementation of clinical pharmacy activities in an orthogeriatric pathway, regarding its impact on medication error prevention, the healthcare professionals' and patients' satisfaction, and the estimated associated pharmaceutical workload. METHODS Participants were aged 75 or older and managed for proximal femoral fracture. Their admission prescription was reviewed. If they were evaluated at high risk of adverse event (AE), medication reconciliation (MedRec) and pharmaceutical interviews (admission, discharge, and targeted on oral anticoagulant) were added at different steps of their care pathway. The achievement and duration of each clinical pharmacy activity were recorded. The number of pharmaceutical interventions (PI) made during prescription review, and unintentional discrepancies (UID) identified during MedRec were collected. A satisfaction questionnaire was sent to patients and healthcare professionals. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Among 455 included patients, 284 patients were considered at high risk of AE. Clinical pharmacy activity achievement rates varied between 12% and 98%. A total of 622 PI and 333 UID were identified. The overall patients' and healthcare professionals' satisfaction was rated from 63% to 100%. The total workload was estimated at 376 h: on average 16 min per prescription review, 43 min per admission MedRec, 26 min per discharge MedRec and 17 to 25 minutes per interview. CONCLUSION The implementation of the programme showed a high potential of drug management securing.

1249,35219572,A cross-sectional survey of attitudes and barriers toward pharmacist services at predoctoral academic dental institutions. BACKGROUND The pharmacy profession continues to evolve through novel practice settings and collaborations. Recent reports have highlighted services provided by pharmacists in academic dental settings. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to measure attitudes and barriers to pharmacist services at academic dental institutions via a survey of dental school administrators. METHODS A survey was circulated in summer 2019 to all accredited dental schools in the United States through the American Dental Education Association clinic dean listserv. The survey consisted of Likert scale questions pertaining to barriers and attitudes regarding pharmacist services in dental education programs and clinics. The survey was open from July 2019 to December 2019. Responses were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS Complete attitude and barrier responses were received from 30 of 66 accredited institutions. Responding schools showed a generally positive attitude toward pharmacist services. Respondents identified funding as the barrier with greatest impact on program development and expansion. CONCLUSION Attitudes among dental education program administrators regarding pharmacists are generally positive. Barriers remain to fully incorporating pharmacists into dental institutions in the United States. Increased funding and reimbursement for pharmacy services would support universal pharmacist integration to this practice setting.,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1251,35221234,"Rural community pharmacists' ability and interest in administering COVID-19 vaccines in the Southern United States. BACKGROUND Community pharmacists are often the most accessible health professional in rural areas, which makes them well positioned to increase vaccine access in their communities. This study sought to document rural pharmacists' ability to and interest in administering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations. METHODS A sample of community pharmacists participating in a rural community pharmacy practice-based research network in the United States completed an online survey that assessed (1) demographic characteristics, (2) previous COVID-19 vaccine training, and (3) ability to administer COVID-19 vaccines. Data were collected between late December 2020 and mid-February 2021. Descriptive statistics and correlations were calculated. RESULTS A total of 69 of 106 pharmacists completed the survey (response rate = 65%). Approximately half of pharmacists were ready (52%) or actively taking steps (39%) to provide COVID-19 vaccines in the next 6 months. Pharmacies had a median of 2 staff members who were authorized to administer COVID-19 vaccines. Almost half (46%) estimated they could administer more than 30 vaccinations per day. Most pharmacies could store vaccines at standard refrigeration (90%) and freezing (83%) levels needed for thawed and premixed vaccines, respectively. Most pharmacists planned to access COVID-19 vaccines through an agreement with a state or local public health entity (48%) or by ordering through group purchasing organizations (46%). Only 23% of pharmacists had received any COVID-19 vaccine training, and only 48% very much wanted to get the vaccine themselves. Several variables, including pharmacy type and pharmacists' vaccine attitudes and previous COVID-19 training, were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the anticipated number of COVID-19 vaccines pharmacies could administer daily. CONCLUSION Even early in the nation's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, most rural pharmacies were interested in and preparing to administer COVID-19 vaccines. Few rural pharmacists had received COVID-19 training, and many expressed some hesitancy to receive the vaccine themselves. The number of vaccines pharmacists could administer varied with pharmacy and pharmacist characteristics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This commentary article highlights the status of clinical pharmacy education in Nepal, explores the challenges and solutions in sustainably reintroducing Post-Baccalaureate Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD, Post-Bac) in Nepal, as was previously launched by Kathmandu University (KU) Department of Pharmacy in 2010, and suggests a few prospects forward. Clinical pharmacy practice has remained on the sidelines and subordinate to physicians in Nepal. KU launched the PharmD (Post-Bac.) as a postgraduate program to establish the professional identity of clinical pharmacists in the country. However, despite unremitting efforts, the program did not thrive long and held since 2014. This paper aimed to explore challenges that remained at the forefront of the program and provide possible solutions for its reintroduction. The KU produced three batches of PharmD Post-Bac. graduates and now the revival of the program is crucial. Undoubtedly, a well-trained clinical preceptor can bring significant changes in the quality and competency of the PharmD graduates. Advocacy programs to foster the role of clinical pharmacists in the patient care services and revisiting of Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) curriculum to complement the necessity of the PharmD program are needed. The non-sustenance of the PharmD program is emblematic of the dire mosaic that the clinical pharmacists are facing while delivering patient-oriented services in the country. Hence, strategies need to be formulated for the revival and sustainability of the program.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1256,35221837,"The COVID-19 vaccination acceptance/hesitancy rate and its determinants among healthcare workers of 91 Countries: A multicenter cross-sectional study.  The aim of this study was to investigate the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rate and its determinants among healthcare workers in a multicenter study. This was a cross-sectional multi-center survey conducted from February 5 to April 29, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 26 items in 6 subscales. The English version of the questionnaire was translated into seven languages and distributed through Google Forms using snowball sampling; a colleague in each country was responsible for the forward and backward translation, and also the distribution of the questionnaire. A forward stepwise logistic regression was utilized to explore the variables and questionnaire factors tied to the intention to COVID-19 vaccination. 4630 participants from 91 countries completed the questionnaire. According to the United Nations Development Program 2020, 43.6 % of participants were from low Human Development Index (HDI) regions, 48.3 % high and very high, and 8.1 % from medium. The overall vaccination hesitancy rate was 37 %. Three out of six factors of the questionnaire were significantly related to intention to the vaccination. While 'Perceived benefits of the COVID-19 vaccination' (OR: 3.82, p-value<0.001) and 'Prosocial norms' (OR: 5.18, p-value<0.001) were associated with vaccination acceptance, 'The vaccine safety/cost concerns' with OR: 3.52, p-value<0.001 was tied to vaccination hesitancy. Medical doctors and pharmacists were more willing to take the vaccine in comparison to others. Importantly, HDI with OR: 12.28, 95 % CI: 6.10-24.72 was a strong positive determinant of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. This study highlighted the vaccination hesitancy rate of 37 % in our sample among HCWs. Increasing awareness regarding vaccination benefits, confronting the misinformation, and strengthening the prosocial norms would be the primary domains for maximizing the vaccination coverage. The study also showed that the HDI is strongly associated with the vaccination acceptance/hesitancy, in a way that those living in low HDI contexts are more hesitant to receive the vaccine.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction: There is a little evidence on efficacy of pharmacy-based interventions on clinical outcomes of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in Pakistan. Objective: To appraise the impact of pharmacist-led self-care education on glycemic control, self-care practices and disease knowledge of T2DM patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7%). Methods: In this 6-months, randomized controlled trial (RCT), n = 75, T2DM patients seeking care at a diabetes clinic were randomized in to two groups. Intervention group (n = 38) received two face-to-face educational sessions (at enrollment and on week 12), whereas control group (n = 37) received usual care. Outcome measures such as glycemic control, self-care practices and disease knowledge were assessed at the time of enrollment and after 6-months in both groups. Results: Thirty-three intervention and thirty-three participants from the control group completed the study. Mean glycated hemoglobin (% HbA1c) significantly reduced in the intervention group from 9.00 ± 1.43 to 8.09 ± 1.16 (p < .01). However, no significant change was observed in the control group (9.20 ± 1.24 to 8.93 ± .97; p = .06). Cohen's d effect size of the intervention on HbA1c was .78. Percentage of participants achieving glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%) were significantly higher (p < .05) in the intervention group as compared to the control group (twenty-four vs. six), after 6 months of the trial. A significant (p < .01) improvement in mean scores for disease knowledge and self-care activities was also observed in the intervention group participants, whereas no significant improvements (p > .05) were observed in the control group. Conclusion: The study demonstrated an improvement in glycemic control, disease knowledge and self-care activities of T2DM patients who received pharmacist-led educational intervention.

1258,35223304,"Chronic Low Back Pain Forced Me to Search for and Find Pain Solutions: An Autobiographical Case Report.  Lifelong, pregnancy-induced low back pain forced me to search for solutions to the problem of pain. Currently, low back pain is often diagnosed as ""nonspecific"" and, as a result, a multitude of tests and poorly effective, at times side effect-laden or habit-forming treatments are recommended. My quest for relief took me to first diagnose my pain as coming from the sacroiliac joints, then to prolotherapy, the first treatment which brought me prolonged relief. I then learned how to perform prolotherapy. In 2009, when I undertook a randomized controlled study of dextrose prolotherapy for rotator cuff tendinopathy, I restricted my practice to treating pain. As low back pain was a large part of my practice, I sought new ways to examine the sacroiliac joints. I conducted a consecutive patient data collection which suggested that over three-quarters of those with low back pain suffer from displaced sacroiliac joints. In a further randomized controlled study, I found that the two-minute corrective exercise I derived from this test provided immediate relief to 90% of those using it. With Dr. John Clark Lyftogt I discovered the safety and effectiveness of 5% dextrose perineural injections to provide immediate pain relief to any area supplied by a nerve I could reach with my needle. As I was treating many diabetics with peripheral neuropathy, I shifted my perineural injection material to 5% mannitol, which may be as effective, with less exposure to dextrose as a potential benefit for diabetics. As most people dislike injections, a pharmacist and I developed a mannitol-containing topical cream for pain relief. We compared a base cream to the same cream with mannitol on lips pretreated with capsaicin cream which made them burn. By 10 minutes the probability the two creams were as effective in relieving the burn was less than 0.001 in favor of mannitol. When given to 235 patients with a total of 289 different painful conditions, we found that it provided 53% relief in an average of 16 minutes with a median of four hours duration. Now retired, after 55 years of medical practice, I love to relieve the pain of friends and fellow hikers using exercise and cream. Searching for and finding solutions to chronic pain has enriched my life and that of many others.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,35225044,"Development of a decision tree for the pharmacy-led consultation of elderly patients with haematological malignancies. INTRODUCTION Elderly patients with haematological malignancies are a population at risk of iatrogenic for whom these activities could optimize therapeutic management. However, the limitation of human resources requires optimization of the process in order to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical activities. The objective was to build a decision tree to optimize the pharmaceutical consultation in these population within a multidisciplinary team in haematology. METHOD Pharmaceutical consultations were proposed to elderly subjects with haematological malignancies followed up in a haematology day hospitalization at the University Hospital of Limoges. Risk factors for prescribing risky drugs in this population were determined by logistic regression models. A decision tree was constructed based on these results and by agreement between pharmacist, geriatrician and hematologist. RESULTS Female gender (aOR[CI95%] = 1.71 [1.14-2.57]), polypharmacy (aOR[CI95%] = 1.89 [1.14-3.13]), hyper-polypharmacy (aOR[CI95%] = 5.73 [3.03-10.84]) and moderate cholinergic load (aOR[CI95%] = 2.15 [1.04-4.45]) were risk factors for the prescription of inappropriate medicine. Female gender (aOR[CI95%] = 1.55 [1.02-2.35]) and hyper-polypharmacy (aOR[CI95%] = 6.19 [1-1.28]) were risk factors for prescribing anticholinergic drugs or anticoagulants; in contrast, frailty status was a protective factor for prescribing anticholinergics (aOR[CI95%] = 0.51 [0.33-0.81]). Prioritization of pharmaceutical consultations is based on frailty status, prescription of a target drug and polypharmacy. DISCUSSION Pharmaceutical consultations during the day hospitalization of elderly subjects with hematological diseases allow to propose therapeutic optimizations. The prioritization proposed in our study would increase the efficiency of pharmaceutical activities in order to improve quality and safety throughout the care pathway of these patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1260,35225341,"Pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of medicinal cannabis dispensing: A narrative review with a systematic approach. OBJECTIVES Medicinal cannabis was introduced with limited understanding of effect, and minimal rigorous evidence supporting efficacy, yet the global demand for medicinal cannabis continues to increase. In Australia, pharmacists remain a key conduit between the prescriber and patient, as most medicinal cannabis products are available only through approved prescriptions. This places pharmacists in a strong position to inform the evolving policy and practice of medicinal cannabis. This review aims to explore pharmacists' experiences and perceptions on medicinal cannabis in the global context by conducting a narrative review with a systematic approach. METHOD MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, and PubMed were searched on July 2021 using keywords and MeSH terms, with studies independently screened for eligibility. Of 278 identified studies, five met inclusion criteria, and were subjected to thematic synthesis for emergent themes. KEY FINDINGS Whilst pharmacists valued being central to medicinal cannabis access, a repeating theme was that pharmacists perceived they were underprepared when engaging with patients about medicinal cannabis. These perceptions were congruent with their dispensing experiences, as most pharmacists reported patients seeking guidance on medicinal cannabis from them, yet only a small proportion felt comfortable in providing this guidance. Underpinning this was a lack of knowledge and low uptake of educational resources. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists are key in providing access to medicinal cannabis, yet they are expected to provide guidance with limited education. These limitations necessitate further investment in ongoing education to pharmacists in countries wishing to involve them in dispensing medicinal cannabis.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS Little is known about usual care by physicians and pharmacy teams to support adherence to statins and whether the extent of this care is associated with adherence to statins. Objective of the study was to examine the relationship between the extent of adherence supporting activities of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) and patients' adherence to statins. METHODS Cross-sectional study in 48 pharmacies and affiliated physicians' practices, between September 3, 2014 and March 20, 2015. Patients visiting the pharmacy with a statin prescription from participating prescribers were invited to participate. Usual care to support adherence was assessed among HCPs with the Quality of Standard Care questionnaire about usual care activities to support adherence. Adherence to statins was assessed among patients with the MARS-5 questionnaire. The association between the extent of HCPs' adherence supporting activities and patients' adherence was examined by means of multilevel regression analysis. RESULTS 1,504 patients and 692 HCPs (209 physicians, 118 pharmacists and 365 pharmacy technicians) participated.

Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2015 and May 2016 at a university research and training hospital's geriatric outpatient clinic. Patients aged ≥65 years and had ≥5 different prescribed medications (considered as polypharmacy) were recruited. The main outcome measure was the frequency of inappropriate medications identified by clinical pharmacist in the outpatient clinic according to the 2nd version of the criterion sets. Results A total of 700 patients (440 female) were included in this study. According to the results, 316 patients (45.1%) with at least one potentially inappropriate medication and 668 patients (98.3%) with at least one potential prescription omission were detected. Potentially inappropriate medications were associated with the number of medications used per patient [odds ratio (OR): 1.20 p<0.001], living alone (OR: 4.12 p=0.02), and having congestive heart failure (OR: 2.41 p<0.001). Twenty-two (27.5%) out of 80 criteria and 4 (11.8%) out of 34 criteria did not apply to the study population. Conclusion Detecting inappropriate medications to maintain treatment effectiveness is necessary to provide the optimum therapy.

BACKGROUND There is increasing interest in the role of community pharmacy in the early diagnosis and prevention of cancer. This study set out to examine how often community pharmacists (CPs) encourage patients to spot or respond to potential signs and symptoms of cancer, and how often they help people to make an informed decision about taking part in bowel cancer screening. METHODS Data from 400 UK CPs, who completed the 2018 Cancer Research UK Healthcare Professional Tracker survey, were analysed. The primary outcomes were: 'how often CPs encourage patients to spot or respond to potential signs and symptoms of cancer' and 'how often CPs encourage eligible people to make an informed decision to participate in bowel cancer screening'. Associations between behaviours and demographic and psychological variables (Capability, Opportunity and Motivation) were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Most (n = 331, 82.8%) CPs reported occasionally, frequently or always encouraging patients to spot or respond to potential signs and symptoms of cancer, while only half (n = 203, 50.8%) reported occasionally, frequently or always helping people make an informed decision to participate in bowel cancer screening.

BACKGROUND Pharmacists guide patients in their use of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM). The present study aimed to evaluate the opinions of Japanese pharmacists regarding TCIM, and to evaluate the usability of the evidence-based Japanese Integrative Medicine (eJIM) website from the pharmacists' point of view. METHODS We conducted a two-stage, mixed-method study using interviews and an internet-based survey. In-person interviews were conducted with 20 pharmacists working in hospitals, dispensing pharmacies, or retail pharmacies. We analyzed their perspectives on TCIM and the usability of the eJIM. Based on the interviews, questionnaires for an internet survey conducted in February 2019 were developed. RESULTS In the interviews, 55% of pharmacists acknowledged TCIM as a supportive measure for modern medicine, and 45% responded that TCIM was efficacious. However, pharmacists' evaluation levels of Kampo medicine were high, whereas pharmacists' attitudes towards dietary supplements were primarily negative. There have been various proposals to improve the eJIM, such as highlighting important information and providing more specific information on TCIM in Japan. An internet survey of 365 pharmacists showed that 67.4% were consulted by patients regarding TCIM. Of these TCIM, pharmacists' evaluation levels of Kampo medicines were high. Only 5% of the respondents had visited the eJIM website prior to the survey, and the overall usability score of each web page was high. CONCLUSIONS Kampo medicines and dietary supplements are common TCIMs that pharmacists use or advise on in Japan.

Dissemination and implementation (D&I) research seeks to obtain generalized knowledge to promote that. Implementation science methodologies can be used to scientifically analyze and generalize the themes previously consid-ered as D&I activities. In this article, the author introduces D&I research, and describes its current status and future perspective in Japan. The promotion of community-based integrated care can help explore the opportunities for pharmacists to play an active role in D&I research, and conduct research using implementation science methodologies to improve the quality of healthcare.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1270,35228374,"[Implementing Clinical Evidences into Community Pharmacies: Results of the COMPASS and COMPASS-BP Studies].  Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has led to the development of evidence-based guidelines. The quality of guidelines has been improved by measuring their quality with The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). However, evidenced by guidelines not implemented in clinical practice or society, the evidence-practice gap has become apparent. The dissemination and implementation research, which studies methods to solve this problem, has attracted the attention of both clinicians and clinical researchers in recent years. In hypertension and diabetes, it is possible to prevent complications by maintaining good blood pressure and blood glucose levels. However, it is difficult for patients to maintain good laboratory values over the long term, and there has been no solution to this problem. Recently, it has been reported that pharmacists in the U.S. and Canada can improve patient outcomes over the long term by using pharmacies to treat these diseases. This review describes the results of the COMPASS study (diabetes) and the COMPASS-BP study (hypertension), which are the first cluster randomized controlled trials conducted in pharmacies in Japan. In addition, it discusses the possibility of implementation in pharmacies in Japan.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1271,35228375,"[Clinical Research in Communities and the Importance of Patient Information].  In collaboration with community pharmacists, we have conducted research including drug utilization reviews since 2009 and patient registry and long-term follow-up since 2013. The results of these projects have influenced the establishment of healthcare policies and pharmacists' roles. Moreover, the number of clinical studies using electronic medical records by hospital pharmacists has increased. Findings from real-world clinical practice provide useful evidence to improve the quality of patient care provided by clinical pharmacists. When comparing research between community and hospital pharmacists, differences are observed in the efficiency of using patients' information. In hospitals, patients' medical records are important for sharing information among healthcare providers. However, in communities, the importance of maintaining patients' information tends to follow dispensing medications and counseling. This practice results in a lack of data for clinical research. Studies in community pharmacies would deepen our understanding of the needs for patient records and improve the quality of patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Our pharmacy, with a sterile dispensary, is a support center for home-care dispensing; we are actively participating in a regional collaboration in combination with medical treatment, nursing, and social care. We have supported about 1000 home care patients so far: most of these have been elderly people living at home, but roughly two dozen were pediatric patients. Although the primary diseases of the children varied, they shared in common both a high dependence on medicine, and great difficulty in moving them. With our pediatric patients, a caregiver had to be in constant attendance because the child's medical care was intermittent. In addition, at the pharmacy, due to the volume of medication for these pediatric patients, caregivers have had to wait a long time for prescription fulfillment, and often receive so much medicine they need a cart to carry it home. Through providing pharmacist-led home guidance on medicines, we are able to offer some support in the pharmacotherapy of children with extreme symptoms who remain under the supervision of a doctor from an advanced medical institution, even after returning home. Through my experience visiting both elderly people and children under home care, I have keenly realized the importance of a community pharmacist's research in improving pediatric formulation and home medical care systems. We must aim to reduce the burden of medication management for both patients and caregivers, and to improve a patient's ""comprehensive quality of life, including (his or her) family"".",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1273,35228377,"[How Should Pharmacists Use the Evidence in the Community-based Integrated Care System?]  Regarding the Separation of Dispensing and Prescribing (SDP) in Japan, there are some negative opinions that the value of separating these services has not been commensurate with the cost. On the other hand, there is substantial data showing the current state of SDP and its merits, which has been collected and published in academic journals. In 2019, the Japan Pharmaceutical Association searched for articles on this subject in domestic academic journals published over the past five years, and found that there were more than 300 articles that evaluated efforts to contribute to therapeutic efficacy and safety at pharmacies. Among these, some addressed the roles required of pharmacies in a community-based integrated care system, such as efforts toward coordinated medicine management of patients who visit multiple medical institutions, follow-up with patients receiving drug therapy, utilization of patient test values at pharmacies, and home medical care. These research results can be utilized in healthcare policy making. However, even with this volume of existing research, it is hard to determine whether such research is sufficient to connect these findings to measures that would improve policy issues. Therefore, it is necessary to identify for researchers the types of evidence that would help guide and formulate effective new SDP policies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1274,35229691,"Designing and implementing methodology for double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials using blood products within the Department of Veterans Affairs. BACKGROUND Success in conducting clinical trials during the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic requires the ability to innovate and adapt. There are well-established procedures for the blinding of investigational agents, especially medications, in placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials within the Veterans Health Administration. However, these procedures, managed by research pharmacists, may not apply to investigational agents that are not exclusively managed by pharmacy, such as blood products, including coronavirus disease of 2019 convalescent plasma (plasma). In the absence of established blinding procedures, such studies require special design considerations to minimize uncertainty or bias. METHODS We describe the processes and procedures developed for blinding of plasma in ""Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1"" as a prototypical study using this class of investigational therapeutic agents. Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1 is an ongoing multicenter randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of plasma added to conventional therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. RESULTS We report the design of procedures to supply investigational blood products or 0.9% normal saline (saline) control while ensuring the integrity of the blind. Key aspects include workflow considerations, physical blinding strategies, and methods for engaging stakeholders. These procedures leverage the well-established Veterans Affairs research pharmacist's research infrastructure, and Blood Bank Services, which is responsible for blood-based investigational products. CONCLUSION By describing the methods used to deliver blood products in a blinded manner in Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1, we strive both to educate and to increase awareness to improve the implementation of these biological therapeutics for future, high-quality research studies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1276,35230633,"Improved neuroprotective activity of Fisetin through SNEDDS in ameliorating the behavioral alterations produced in rotenone-induced Parkinson's model.  Fisetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. However, it loses its importance as an effective phytochemical due to its poor water solubility and lower bioavailability. In the present study, the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) of fisetin was developed in order to improve its pharmacological activity. The developed SNEDDS of fisetin was evaluated for improving the rotenone-induced behavioral changes in the rats, and its efficacy was compared with naïve fisetin. It was noticed that fisetin loaded in the SNEDDS formulation significantly (p < 0.001) ameliorated the rotenone-induced alteration in the body weight, grip strength, beam walk, postural instability, etc., in rats when compared to the effect of naïve fisetin. Naïve fisetin significantly (p < 0.05) ameliorated the effect of rotenone on the level of dopamine only at a higher dose. Whereas, SNEDDS of fisetin produced a significant (p < 0.05) effect at both dose levels when compared with the diseased group as well as also produced a significant (p < 0.05) effect when compared with the naïve fisetin group. The results of histopathological examination revealed about the neuroprotective effect of SNEDDS loaded with fisetin as observed through the protection of neuronal damage. From this study, it was concluded that SNEDDS improved the anti-Parkinsonian activity of fisetin by improving the behavioral alteration produced by rotenone due to enhancement in its solubility and bioavailability.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

We are experimenting with a pharmaceutical care pathway including a support approach to promote continuity between these two activities and the initiation of shared medication review. MATERIALS AND METHODS An admission and discharge medication reconciliation has been set up in a geriatric follow-up care and rehabilitation service. A drug assessment was also carried out during the hospital stay. Support for community pharmacists following conciliation was provided by phone calls. Medication discrepancies at admission and discharge, pharmaceutical interventions (PI) as well as satisfaction and difficulties encountered by community pharmacists were collected. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were included in the study. On admission, 33% of patients had an unintentional discrepancy and 15% on discharge. On average 1.15 PI per patient were notified. The support was propound to 13 pharmacists. Eight pharmacists (62%) accepted it. Among them, 5 (62.5%) had never performed a medication review. Lack of time was the main difficulty encountered by pharmacists. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Our pathway enables to integrate hospital and primary care activities and specifically support the delicate transition between them. This enables to facilitate the implementation of these activities and to maintain a relevant and secure continuity of pharmaceutical care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1278,35231719,"Predictors of clinician use of Australia's national health information exchange in the emergency Department: An analysis of log data. OBJECTIVE This study explores patient and context related factors associated with use of Australia's national personally controlled Health Information Exchange (HIE), My Health Record, by emergency department (ED) clinicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis explored secondary routinely-collected data including all patients who presented (between August 2019-2021) to the ED at a not-for-profit hospital in Melbourne. Presentation data were linked to the HIE access log-data, and human resources data. The primary outcome indicated HIE access by an ED pharmacist, doctor or nurse, within 3 days of the patient presenting to the ED, or not. Nine variables were explored with logistic regression, representing patient (gender, age, diagnosis) and other factors (presentation time, arrival method, referral, acuity/triage, length of stay, admitted into hospital). RESULTS HIE is accessed in 17.43% of patient presentations to the ED, led by pharmacists (15.60%). Overall, as demonstrated in themultivariable analysis, increased HIE access was associated with increasing age, with the biggest effect for 75-84-year old's (odd's ratio 26.15; 95% confidence interval 15.37-44.50), when compared to < 4 years of age. HIE access was also significantly and positively associated with patients who were later admitted into hospital from theED (4.96; 4.61-5.34). CONCLUSION The results suggest users of HIE in the ED employ the system to meet their needs, but not for all patients. To maximise value derived from HIE use, clinicians should target system access for patients where the benefit of accessing the record outweighs the cost - this research suggests that is for patients who are older in age and are likely to be admitted, potentially linked to greater condition complexity. If the use of a HIE is to improve the provision of care in the ED, the key stakeholders governing patient information within the HIE need to focus on improving clinician recording behaviours for older people and those suffering from complex medical conditions. Doctors and nurses lag behind with respect to the use of the HIE by pharmacists. Therefore, a focus on encouraging HIE engagement across these clinician groups is drastically required.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Parenteral nutrition, usually indicated for preterm infants with a birthweight<1500 g and sick newborns, enables the supply with critical nutrients. As a high degree of therapy safety is required, a European guideline provides recommendations for safe therapy procedures. The present project aimed to evaluate the implementation of the European guideline in German perinatal centers and to identify possible barriers that impede its implementation. A further goal was to develop solution approaches to overcome possible barriers. METHODS AND RESULTS A multidisciplinary cooperation conducted an online survey questioning the current implementation procedures of the European guideline among pediatricians and hospital pharmacists. Results show barriers in the provisioning process of parenteral nutrition that hinder a guideline-compliant implementation in practice. Based on results of this survey, an expert network developed an interactive toolkit with simplified guideline recommendations, guideline-compliant advice for practice, best-practice examples, forms, and handouts. It seeks to encourage critical reflection of routine processes and provides concrete solutions to overcome barriers in practice. CONCLUSION The current procedures related to parenteral nutrition deviate from guideline recommendations. The developed toolkit provides practice-oriented support aiming to enhance the guideline-compliant implementation of parenteral nutrition in perinatal centers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1280,35232489,"Assessment of private health sector prescribing patterns and adherence to prescription format using World Health Organization core drug use indicators in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. BACKGROUND Currently, the private healthcare sector's role in healthcare delivery is growing in Ethiopia. However, there are limited studies on private healthcare sector drug use patterns. This study aimed to evaluate the private healthcare sector prescribing practices and adherence to prescription format, using some of the World Health Organization (WHO) core drug use indicators in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to collect quantitative data from prescriptions prescribed and dispensed by private healthcare sectors in the Lemi-Kura sub-city, Addis Ababa. The study was conducted from June to July 2021. The WHO criteria were used to evaluate prescribing and prescription completeness indicators. Prescriptions, kept for the last 1 year that were prescribed between January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, by private drug outlets, were analyzed. Simple random and systematic sampling procedures were employed in selecting drug outlets and prescriptions, respectively. RESULTS Of a total of 1,200 prescriptions, 2,192 drugs were prescribed and the average number of drugs per prescription was 1.83. Generic names, antibiotics, injections, and drugs on the Ethiopian essential medicines list accounted for 77.4, 63.8, 11.5, and 80.6% of all prescriptions, respectively. Among the patient identifiers, the patient card number (54.3%), weight (2.3%), and diagnoses (31.7%) were less likely to be completed. In terms of the drug-related information, the dosage form (35.5%) was the least likely to be completed. Only 36.6 and 25.8% of prescriptions contained the names and qualifications of the prescribers, respectively. It was difficult to obtain prescription papers with the dispenser identifier. CONCLUSION The study findings indicated prescribing and prescription completeness indicators all considerably deviated from WHO standards and hence unsuitable. This situation could be critical since a similar pattern is reported from public healthcare sectors, which might imply the extent of non-adherence to WHO core drug use standards. Consequently, it could play a considerable role in increasing irrational medicine use in Ethiopia.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Without a cure, vaccination is the most reliable means of combating COVID-19 pandemic, since non-pharmacological measures could not prevent its spread, as evidenced in the emergence of a second wave. This study assessed the readiness of pharmacists to receive, recommend and administer COVID-19 vaccines to clients in Nigeria. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which responses were collected from pharmacists in Nigeria through Google Form link. A 21-item questionnaire was developed and validated for the study. The link was shared on the WhatsApp groups of eligible respondents. The response was downloaded into Microsoft Excel (2019) and cleared of errors. This was uploaded into KwikTables (Beta Version 2021) for data analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were used to describe the data. Chi-squared test was used to determine the relationship between all the responses and the practice areas of the pharmacists. Results A total of 509 pharmacists responded to the study, but 507 indicated their areas of practice. The highest response of 247(48.7%) was obtained from hospital pharmacists, then community pharmacists; 157(31.0%). Hospital and community pharmacists accounted for 96 and 66 of the 191(37.7%) pharmacists that would probably accept the vaccine (p=0.126). The Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine was the preferred brand for 275(54.2%) respondents. Healthcare Professionals>Elderly>General Populace>Children was the order of roll-out recommended by 317(62.5%). Adverse-effect-following-immunization was the concern of 330(65.1%) pharmacists. Age was a factor in their likelihood of recommending the COVID-19 vaccine to clients (p=0.001). Conclusion This study established that most pharmacists are willing to accept to be vaccinated against COVID-19, recommend and administer it to other citizens. They were impressed by the effectiveness and cost of some of the vaccines, but were concerned about their possible adverse effects. The pharmacists would want the authorities to consider strategies that will make the vaccines accessible to all citizens.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION The role of a community pharmacist is well recognized in the literature as the most accessible health care provider that promotes health wellness and disease prevention. Evidence supports their role in cancer health promotion though this is not seen yet in practice. The aim of the study was to assess community pharmacists' preparedness in terms of knowledge, role perception and barriers for providing cancer health promotion in North Cyprus. METHODS A cross-sectional face-to-face questionnaire-based study was carried among a randomly selected representative sample of community pharmacists in North Cyprus between June 2020 and August 2020. A pre-validated 31-item questionnaire tool was revised by an expert panel and adopted for purpose of this study. RESULTS 200 (64.5%) out of 310 approached community pharmacists' have accepted and responded to the questionnaire of which 183 were fully answered. The community pharmacists' awareness of cancer was moderate, as 70% answered correctly. Most respondents (93.4%) agree that pharmacists should be involved in cancer health promotion. Most respondents (> 90%) agree that pharmacist's lack of interest in oncology, lack of educational material and pharmacist's hesitancy about their knowledge of cancer are respectively the most important barriers for cancer health promotion. CONCLUSION The study shows that community pharmacist well perceives their role in cancer health promotion despite moderate awareness of cancer related facts and hesitancy of their knowledge necessary for assuming their role.

PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to develop a standard operational and distributional weighted workload model that is applicable across an integrated, diverse healthcare system. This model aims to not only demonstrate the operational intensity of pharmacy practice but also to inform opportunities to decrease waste, increase efficiency, facilitate growth, and demonstrate value across operational and distributional pharmacy services. SUMMARY Time studies were conducted at 8 hospitals within the UNC Health system to objectively measure time spent within each operational process in order to create a system-wide weighted workload model. Time study results informed the development of a system-wide weighted workload model. Data from December 29, 2019, through December 26, 2020, was then applied to this weighted workload model. With this model, acute care hospital and infusion center operational areas were compared in thousands of combinations within single operational areas and across any and all operational areas by dispense code, weighted work, and ratio of weighted work to total sum of dispenses at each site. CONCLUSION The model successfully achieved the objective to develop a standard operational weighted workload model that is applicable across the integrated, diverse care system.

PURPOSE Although pharmacist-provided diabetes services have been shown to be effective, the effectiveness of telepharmacy (TP) in diabetes management has not been clearly established. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes TP services. METHODS PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched (from inception through September 2021) to identify published studies that evaluated the effect of TP services in patients with diabetes mellitus and reported either glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting blood glucose (FBG) outcomes. Mean difference (MD), weighted mean difference (WMD), relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. RESULTS 36 studies involving 13,773 patients were included in the systematic review, and 23 studies were included in the meta-analysis. TP was associated with a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c (MD, -1.26%; 95% CI, -1.69 to -0.84) from baseline. FBG was not significantly affected (MD, -25.32 mg/dL; 95% CI, -57.62 to 6.98). Compared to non-TP service, TP was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.76). In a subset of studies that compared TP to face-to-face (FTF) pharmacy services, no significant difference in HbA1c lowering was seen between the 2 groups (WMD, -0.09%; 95% CI, -1.07 to 0.90).

1289,35236166,"Knowledge of Galactagogue Use During Breastfeeding in Australia: A Cross Sectional Online Survey. BACKGROUND Galactagogues have been used for centuries to induce, maintain, or increase a mother's milk supply. Recently, there has been an apparent increase in utilization and promotion of galactagogues, largely in the absence of data regarding their efficacy and safety. However, there is limited contemporary evidence about knowledge of these substances in the community or how and where individuals seek information. RESEARCH AIM To evaluate knowledge about galactagogue use during breastfeeding among birth parents, including recognition of specific substances, perceptions of safety, and common information sources. METHOD An online, prospective, cross-sectional survey of Australian birthing parents (N = 2055) who were currently breastfeeding or had previously breastfed their infants was conducted from September to December 2019. The survey included questions about recognition of galactagogues, perceptions of safety, and information-seeking behaviors. RESULTS Among participants, 47% (n = 882) were primiparous and 65% (n = 1,219) were currently breastfeeding. The most recognized galactagogues included lactation cookies (89%; n = 1,828), brewer's yeast (79%; n = 1,629), fenugreek (74%; n = 1,519), and domperidone (69%; n = 1,420). Respondents cited the internet (52%; n = 1,066), lactation support providers (46%; n = 951), midwives (42%; n = 873), general practitioners (39%; n = 802), and social media (35%; n = 714) as common information sources. Lactation support providers and breastfeeding helplines were commonly rated as helpful; whereas, general practitioners and community pharmacists were often rated as unhelpful. While most participants perceived galactagogues to be safe, herbal or dietary galactagogues were perceived to be safer than pharmaceutical galactagogues.

1290,35236407,"Pharmaceutical intervention for adverse events improves quality of life in patients with cancer undergoing outpatient chemotherapy. BACKGROUND The effect of pharmaceutical intervention to treat adverse events on quality of life (QOL) in outpatients receiving cancer chemotherapy is unclear. We investigated whether pharmaceutical intervention provided by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians improves QOL with outpatient cancer chemotherapy. METHODS We conducted a single-center retrospective descriptive study of pharmaceutical intervention for patients receiving outpatient cancer chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital between September 2017 and July 2020. We assessed patient QOL using the Japanese version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. We compared the EQ-5D-5L utility value and incidence of grade 2 or higher adverse events before and after pharmaceutical intervention. RESULTS Our analysis included 151 patients who underwent 210 chemotherapy cycles. Pharmaceutical intervention significantly improved patients' EQ-5D-5L utility values from 0.8197 to 0.8603 (P < 0.01). EQ-5D-5L utility values were significantly improved after pharmaceutical intervention for nausea and vomiting (pre-intervention 0.8145, post-intervention 0.8603, P = 0.016), peripheral neuropathy (pre-intervention 0.7798, post-intervention 0.7988, P = 0.032) and pain (pre-intervention 0.7625, post-intervention 0.8197, P = 0.035). Although not statistically significant, the incidence of grade 2 or higher adverse events, including nausea and vomiting, dermopathy, pain, oral mucositis, diarrhea and dysgeusia, tended to be lower post-intervention than pre-intervention.

OBJECTIVE To describe the pharmacists' workflow, including tasks and time spent, to better understand their work capacity. DESIGN Cross-sectional, observational, time and motion study. SETTING Community pharmacies in Western Australia and New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS Currently registered and practising pharmacists were approached using snowball sampling and selected using purposive techniques to obtain balance representation of metropolitan and rural pharmacies, as well as high and low script volumes where possible. RESULTS Twenty-four pharmacists across 15 pharmacies participated during the 135 sessions totalling over 274 hours of observation. Dispensing (30%), indirect patient services (17%), counselling (15%) and professional management activities (15%) were the top four duties pharmacists performed, while only 2% of time was spent on professional services such as pain clinics and influenza vaccinations. Tasks were frequently interrupted and often performed simultaneously. Breaks and consumer-contact times were limited. More time was spent on professional service activities in non-metropolitan pharmacies, in pharmacies with greater daily prescription volumes and those with one or more support pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to quantify the pharmacists' tasks in Australian community pharmacies. Much time is being spent on dispensing, supply and management activities with little time for providing additional professional services. An extra supporting pharmacist is likely necessary to increase professional services. These findings could support future research around barriers and enablers of conducive workflows and of extended professional services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective To provide an overview of instruments that measure adherence to medications to facilitate selection of an instrument and to provide a summary of some published adherence assessment tools tailored to be used by the healthcare team, especially the pharmacists. Data Sources Studies were identified via PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar using the search terms medication adherence, compliance, persistence, combined with the terms questionnaire, scale, survey, self-report, and instrument. Study Selection Articles written in English, describing questionnaire instruments that were psychometrically evaluated (reporting a good coefficient of internal consistency, reliability assessed through Cronbach's alpha, and had been validated against a subjective or objective measure), and containing 30 or fewer items were included. Data Synthesis Twelve instruments were identified and included in this review. Instruments were reviewed by evaluating specific characteristics (number of items, sample size, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, questionnaire completion time, criterion validity, and component analysis). Conclusion Various instruments are used to assess patient adherence to medications; however, no single one performs well on all criteria. Every instrument has different advantages and unique properties. A particular instrument can be chosen after considering certain factors, such as the specific requirements, population, the needed time to complete the questionnaire, the sensitivity, and the specificity of the questionnaire. Moreover, there is a recognized need to provide primary care medication adherence services customized to patient's needs. A link for teamwork between healthcare providers such as pharmacists and patients is needed. This link can be a validated instrument to assess patient's adherence to medication.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1293,35238008,"Comparison of PACU length of stay and opioid requirements of patients maintained on buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder. OBJECTIVES Literature supporting best practice of perioperative buprenorphine management for opioid use disorder is evolving with more recent studies trending toward maintenance of home dose. To guide treatment protocols at our institution, we evaluated patients taking medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) undergoing similar surgeries. Patients were maintained on either their outpatient buprenorphine or methadone. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected on 46 patients maintained on buprenorphine MOUD who underwent surgery. A subset of these patients (n = 24) was compared with 24 patients maintained on methadone MOUD, matched on surgical procedure, admission date, age, and sex. DESIGN This is a retrospective matched control study. SETTING An academic, tertiary, Level 1 trauma center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were post-operative opioid use and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay. RESULTS No significant differences in demographic characteristics, physical status, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, or illicit substance use history were observed between patient groups. A higher proportion of patients taking methadone was admitted due to infection (41.7 percent vs 16.7 percent, p = 0.031) and underwent nonelective surgery (75.0 percent vs 45.8 percent, p = 0.039). No significant differences were observed between patients taking buprenorphine versus methadone with respect to PACU length of stay, post-operative opioid consumption, time-to-transition to oral opioids, or discharge opioid prescriptions. Patients taking buprenorphine were more likely to receive intravenous lidocaine (25.0 percent vs 0.0 percent, p = 0.031) and ketamine (83.3 percent vs 54.2 percent, p = 0.039). CONCLUSION Findings from this study support accumulating evidence that patients should be maintained on buprenorphine MOUD throughout the perioperative period.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Hyperinflammation-induced respiratory failure is a leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 infection. Immunosuppressants such as, Baricitinib and interleukin inhibitors are the drug-of-choice to suppress cytokine storm in COVID-19. Here, we compared the therapeutic safety and efficacy of triple-immunosuppressants with dual-immunosuppressants in patients with severe-to-critical COVID-19. METHODS This study was conducted on 103 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 103 patients, 49 (N) and 54 (N) patients received dual-immunosuppressants (baricitinib plus two doses of secukinumab) and triple immunosuppressants (baricitinib plus single dose of tocilizumab and secukinumab) in group A and group B, respectively. Groups were compared in terms of clinical outcome, critical support-requirement, survival, re-hospitalisation, and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS Patients in group B achieved normal blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) earlier than the patients of group A [4 day (IQR: 3-12) vs 5 day (IQR: 5-14), p < .05]. The requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation (MV) support was less in group B than group A [16.7%/28.6%, 11.1%/18.4%, respectively p < .05]]. The incidence of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome and 60-day all cause mortality was reduced in group B compared to group A [0.43 (0.19-0.98), p < .05; 0.35 (0.08-1.44), p > .05]. The 60-day re-hospitalisation rate was two-fold high in group A than group B (p = .024). Immunosuppressant-associated adverse events and secondary bacterial/fungal infections were relative high in patients of group B. CONCLUSIONS Triple-immunosuppressants in severe-to-critical COVID-19 infection exhibited better clinical outcome; reduced ICU and MV requirement; shorter hospital stay with deceased 60-day all cause mortality and re-hospitalisation compared to dual-immunosuppressants.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assesses Jordanian community pharmacists' readiness and willingness to deliver vaccination services in their practice sites. Between February and April 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was distributed via social media, WhatsApp messages, and personal communication. The questionnaire targeted practicing community pharmacies. Descriptive and inferential data analysis was carried out. A total of 403 community pharmacists participated in the study. Almost 146 (36%) community pharmacists reported vaccinating patients in their practice sites. However, readiness assessment revealed that only 54 (13.4%) pharmacists received the required training and qualifications. Moreover, 33 (8.2%) study participants worked in adequately equipped and designed community pharmacies. Overall, surveyed participants held positive attitudes toward their involvement in vaccination services: 260 (64.5%) pharmacists were willing to vaccinate patients, and 227 (65.0%) out of unready, unqualified, participants were willing to get needed training and qualifications. According to study participants, regulatory and professional bodies (Ministry of Health, Jordan Pharmacists Association) are influential in supporting pharmacist-vaccinators. Among the investigated factors, organizational structure and employment status were significantly associated with pharmacists' readiness to deliver vaccination.

1299,35240242,"From wandering weeds to pharmacy: An insight into traditional uses, phytochemicals and pharmacology of genus Chromolaena (Asteraceae). ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Chromolaena species, of the Asteraceae family, are distributed across the tropical and the temperate regions of Africa, the Americas, southern Asia, and Australia. Despite ""falling out of favour"" among the people because of their ""weedy"" nature, Chromolaena species have indisputable long medicinal history in the treatment of malaria, nasal congestion, inflammation, eye disorders, asthma, cough, flu, headache, and cold. AIM OF THE REVIEW The aim of this review is to systematically summarize the current knowledge on ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and real-time scientific applications of the genus Chromolaena after re-classification from genus Eupatorium, as well as to proffer integrated approaches in maximizing their therapeutic values despite their ""weedy"" nature. MATERIALS AND METHODS First, the current species in the genus were verified by ""The Plant List"" (http://www.theplantlist.org) and ""Royal Botanic Gardens/Kew/Missouri Botanical Garden"" (http://mpns.kew.org/mpns-portal/). Second, the relevant information on each of the identified species was gathered from following databases: Google Scholar, Online Wiley library, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Scopus, PubMed. Scientific literature was searched from inception till August 2021. RESULTS More than 190 phytochemicals have been isolated and identified from 27 species of the genus, including flavonoids, alkaloids, triterpenoids, diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, steroids, fatty acids, and coumarins among others. Pharmacological investigations, both in vitro and in vivo, have shown that the extracts and the compounds have antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic activities among others. CONCLUSIONS Many species of genus have potential therapeutic values, and hence they are more than ""wandering"" weeds. In addition, there is growing interest in the real-time scientific applications of the genus in the production of pharmacological polyherbal products, and this should serve as a stimulus to strategically develop integrated control approaches for preserving these species, with a view of maximizing their therapeutic values and reducing their cost of eradication.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE This qualitative explorative study was conducted to explore the key challenges and future directions of caring for women with epilepsy (WWE) from the perspectives of healthcare professionals who provide care for WWE in Palestine. METHODS A qualitative explorative design was used in this study in adherence to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research. The study participants were interviewed in semi-structured in-depth interviews using a pre-validated and pilot-tested interview schedule. The interpretative description approach was used to qualitatively analyze the contents of the interviews. RESULTS Interviews were conducted with 6 neurologists, 5 gynecologists, 3 psychiatrists, 5 clinical pharmacists, and 1 internal medicine specialist. The current challenges and future directions in caring for WWE were grouped under healthcare system-, healthcare provider-, patient-, and society-related. Lack of adequate availability, accessibility, and affordability of neurology services and safe antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were the main challenges. Increasing access of WWE to specialized neurology services and improving acceptance in the society were the main future directions. CONCLUSION Findings of this study highlighted the key challenges and future directions of caring for WWE in a resource-poor healthcare system.

1301,35240532,"Tick ecology and Lyme borreliosis prevention: A regional survey of pharmacists' knowledge in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France: Ticks and tick-born Disease (TTBD).  The most prevalent vector-borne diseases in Europe are caused by tick-borne pathogens, such as bacteria of the genus Borrelia that cause Lyme borreliosis. In this context, retail pharmacists are frequently the first medical source of information in the event of a tick bite. The objective of this study was to assess pharmacy professionals' knowledge about both tick ecology and the appropriate measures for tick bites and Lyme borreliosis prevention. It was based on an online survey of 364 pharmacists and pharmacy assistants located in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France. The results showed solid knowledge about preventive measures for tick bite and Lyme borreliosis, but weaker knowledge about tick biology (hosts, suitable habitats, favorable conditions for tick activity, etc.). In particular, several stereotypes were observed in the responses of the pharmacy professionals. These appear to result from a social construction of the knowledge on ticks and tick-borne diseases previously shown to the general population in the region. The results highlight the need for continuous training about ticks and tick-borne diseases for healthcare professionals serving local populations that live in endemic areas.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1302,35241170,"The efficacy of single pharmacist medication review among type II diabetic patients who take six chronic medications or more: a case-control study. BACKGROUND Pharmacist medication review has been implemented in many health organizations throughout the world in an attempt to alleviate the underlying risk of polypharmacy in elderly patients. These consultations are often frequent and prolonged, and are thus associated with increased costs. To date, data regarding the most effective way to utilize pharmacist consultations for the improvement of health status is scant. AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of a single pharmacist consultation on changes in chronic medication regimes and on selected outcomes of diabetes 1-year after the consultation. METHODS A case-control study included an intervention group of 740 patients who had pharmacist consultations and a reference group of 1476 matched patients who did not have a pharmacist consultation. 1-year outcome measures were compared including changes in medications, improved safety, and objective variables such as Hba1c, blood pressure, and lipid profile. RESULTS In the pharmacist consultation group, there were significantly more treatment changes ([mean 1.5 vs. 0.7, p < 0.001 medications were stopped], and [mean 1.3 vs. 0.4, p < 0.05 medications were started]). Patient safety improved with a general reduction in opiates and benzodiazepines ([50.0% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.05 opioids were stopped] and [58.8% vs 43.8%, p < 0.001 benzodiazepines were stopped]). Sulfonylurea treatment reduced (10.7% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.05 patients who stopped Sulfonylurea) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) increased (16.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001 patients who started GLP-1). Additionally, HbA1c levels showed a small decrease in the pharmacist consultation group ([- 0.18 ± 1.11] vs. [- 0.051 ± 0.80], p = 0.0058) but no significant differences were found regarding blood pressure or lipids profile.

1303,35241184,"Development and feasibility testing of a training programme for community pharmacists to deliver a culturally responsive medication review intervention. BACKGROUND Cultural differences between health professionals and Indigenous peoples contribute to health inequalities, and effective cross-cultural communication and person-centred healthcare are critical remedial elements. Community pharmacists can play a significant role by reducing medication-related problems through medication reviews, yet barriers to access include cultural and linguistic challenges. The Indigenous Medication Review Service (IMeRSe) aimed to address these barriers via a culturally responsive intervention. The aim of this paper is to present the cross-cultural training framework developed as a component of this intervention and the feasibility evaluation of the first stage of the training framework. METHODS A training framework was developed, emphasising pharmacists' skills and confidence in effective cross-cultural communication and relationship-building with Indigenous Australians (Please note that the use of the term 'Indigenous' in this manuscript includes all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and acknowledges their rich traditions and heterogenous cultures) across three stages: (1) online and workshop-based, covering Indigenous history and health, cross-cultural communication and a holistic, strengths-based approach to intervention delivery; (2) orientation to local Aboriginal Health Services, community and cultural protocols; and (3) ongoing mentoring. The feasibility evaluation of the first stage included the following: self-reported levels of cultural capability, cultural confidence and skills, motivators and barriers to working with Indigenous Australians, assessed pre- and post-training. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires including a 22-item validated Cultural Capability Measurement Tool. Paired t tests assessed change in mean scores of Likert scale data. RESULTS Stage 1 development resulted in an 8.5-h standardised cross-cultural training programme tested with 39 pharmacists working across urban and rural/remote Australia. Thirty-six pharmacists completed the feasibility evaluation (75.7% female, all non-Indigenous, 75.7% never attended prior cross-cultural training). Participants reported overall acceptability with training; the majority perceived it added value to their practice. Improved cultural capability post-training was reflected in increased scores for 21/22 items, nine reaching statistical significance. There were significant improvements for all 26 confidence and skills statements, and selected motivational and barrier statements, particularly participants role in improving Indigenous health outcomes and cross-cultural communication. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary evidence that the training programme was feasible to deliver and prepared pharmacists to deliver a culturally responsive medication review intervention. The online knowledge-based modules and face-to-face workshops provide a standardised framework for larger-scale implementation of the intervention training.

1304,35241436,"Inpatient pharmacists using a readmission risk model in supporting discharge medication reconciliation to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions: a quality improvement intervention. INTRODUCTION Reducing unplanned hospital readmissions is an important priority for all hospitals and health systems. Hospital discharge can be complicated by discrepancies in the medication reconciliation and/or prescribing processes. Clinical pharmacist involvement in the medication reconciliation process at discharge can help prevent these discrepancies and possibly reduce unplanned hospital readmissions. METHODS We report the results of our quality improvement intervention at Duke University Hospital, in which pharmacists were involved in the discharge medication reconciliation process on select high-risk general medicine patients over 2 years (2018-2020). Pharmacists performed traditional discharge medication reconciliation which included a review of medications for clinical appropriateness and affordability. A total of 1569 patients were identified as high risk for hospital readmission using the Epic readmission risk model and had a clinical pharmacist review the discharge medication reconciliation. RESULTS This intervention was associated with a significantly lower 7-day readmission rate in patients who scored high risk for readmission and received pharmacist support in discharge medication reconciliation versus those patients who did not receive pharmacist support (5.8% vs 7.6%). There was no effect on readmission rates of 14 or 30 days. The clinical pharmacists had at least one intervention on 67% of patients reviewed and averaged 1.75 interventions per patient. CONCLUSION This quality improvement study showed that having clinical pharmacists intervene in the discharge medication reconciliation process in patients identified as high risk for readmission is associated with lower unplanned readmission rates at 7 days. The interventions by pharmacists were significant and well received by ordering providers. This study highlights the important role of a clinical pharmacist in the discharge medication reconciliation process.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Inpatient,
1305,35241634,"Therapeutic Basis of Generic Substitution of Antiseizure Medications.  More than thirty antiseizure medications (ASMs) are available for treating epilepsy. ASMs differ in their potency and efficacy in controlling seizures by acting on diverse targets in the brain, often with variable pharmacokinetics. Moreover, nearly 30% of people with epilepsy have drug-resistant or intractable seizures. Generic substitution of ASMs is a complex issue. It is thought that frequent generic substitution in people with epilepsy may cause problems because FDA rules allow too much variability across products. The standard bioequivalence range (80% to 125%) appears too broad for many ASMs, especially those exhibiting little separation between therapeutic and toxic levels. Hence, sub-therapeutic concentration may lead to therapeutic failure with seizure recurrence , which could be life threatening. A supra-therapeutic level could result in adverse effects or compliance issues. There are reported issues with generic substitutions of phenytoin, topiramate, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine . There is discussion in the epilepsy community about additional guidelines, including designation of generic ASMs as Narrow Therapeutic Index (NTI) drugs and how patient education plays a role in generic substitution. Overall, based on the published evidence on specific generic ASMs, FDA bioequivalence standards are not the cause of problems with generic ASM substitution. Rather, it is imperative that physicians and pharmacists provide adequate patient education on what to expect when switching to generic ASMs, including changes in medication shape and color. Another suggestion would be to consider that all ASMs be considered for inclusion in NTI class to prevent the clinical outcome issues associated with generic ASM switching. Significance Statement There are critical aspects to consider when switching from a brand name antiseizure medication (ASM) when a generic becomes available or switching between generics. Generic ASMs are interchanged with little consideration of differences in therapeutic equivalence and other clinical factors. This article describes key issues on generic substitution of ASMs and highlights critical pharmacotherapeutic issues associated with generic ASMs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Breastfeeding offers a multitude of benefits for infants, mothers, and society. Exclusive breastfeeding of infants is recommended for at least the first 6 months of life. Although transfer of drug into breastmilk can occur, most medications are safe to use during breastfeeding. Pharmacists, regarded as the most accessible health care professionals, recognize their role as medication specialists for breastfeeding women. Unfortunately, a lack of formal and continuing education on medication use during lactation often results in pharmacists providing the unnecessary recommendation to disrupt breastfeeding during medication use. In addition to lack of education, other barriers pharmacists experience in providing optimal patient care during lactation include difficulty identifying breastfeeding status and inconsistency in recommendations between scientific resources.

1307,35241981,"A Comprehensive Review of Vaping Use in Pediatric Patients and Recent Changes in Regulatory Laws.  The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), also known as vapes, by adolescents and young adults has dramatically increased over the past several years. E-cigarettes continue to be the most used form of tobacco among youth. As a result of this concerning trend, policies at both the state and federal levels have been implemented to limit availability in this population. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had some positive and negative effects on the youth vaping epidemic with adolescent consumers reporting limited access to retail sites during the stay-at-home executive orders, but easier access with online purchasing because age verification was often not required. Complications resulting from vaping have been reported and include e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and thrombotic events. Data suggest that the use of vaping devices can lead to both short- and long-term respiratory morbidity in the pediatric population.

1309,35245312,"Investigational medicinal products, related costs and hospital pharmacy services for investigator-initiated trials: A mixed-methods study. BACKGROUND Conducting high quality investigator-initiated trials (IITs) is challenging and costly. The costs of investigational medicinal products (IMPs) in IITs and the role of hospital pharmacies in the planning of IITs are unclear. We conducted a mixed-methods study to compare planned and actual costs of IMPs in Swiss IITs, to examine potential reasons for differences, and to gather stakeholder views about hospital services for IITs. METHODS We included all IITs with IMP services from the Basel hospital pharmacy invoiced between January 2014 and June 2020 (n = 24). We documented trial and IMP characteristics including planned and actual IMP costs. Our working definition for a substantial cost difference was that the actual IMP costs were more than 10% higher than the planned IMP costs in a trial. We conducted semi-structured interviews with investigators, clinical trials unit and hospital pharmacy staff, and qualitatively analyzed transcribed interviews. RESULTS For 13 IITs we observed no differences between planned and actual costs of IMPs (median, 11'000 US$; interquartile range [IQR], 8'882-16'302 US$), but for 11 IITs we found cost increases from a median of 11'000 US$ (IQR, 8'922-36'166 US$) to a median over 28'000 US$ (IQR, 13'004-49'777 US$). All multicenter trials and 10 of 11 IITs with patients experienced substantial cost differences. From the interviews we identified four main themes: 1) Patient recruitment and organizational problems were identified as main reasons for cost differences, 2) higher actual IMP costs were bearable for most investigators, 3) IMP services for IITs were not a priority for the hospital pharmacy, and 4) closer collaboration between clinical trial unit and hospital pharmacy staff, and sufficient staff for IITs at the hospital pharmacy could improve IMP services. CONCLUSIONS Multicenter IITs enrolling patients are particularly at risk for higher IMP costs than planned. These trials are more difficult to plan and logistically challenging, which leads to delays and expiring IMP shelf-lives. IMP services of hospital pharmacies are important for IITs in Switzerland, but need to be further developed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency of use, sources of information, and selection criteria of Greek residents regarding over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, as well as their opinion about their dispensing in nonpharmacy settings. METHODS This was a survey study in which an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge, habits, and attitudes about OTC drugs. Data were collected from March 2017 to July 2017 in Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece. Logistic regression was used to investigate significant factors that affect the participants' behavior. RESULTS A total of 782 participants completed the questionnaire. The population had a mean (SD) age of 46 (17) years and 55.1% were females. About one-third (32.5%) of the participants used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more than once per week. OTC drugs acting on the gastrointestinal tract were used to a lower extent (13.2%). The majority (84%) of the respondents consult a healthcare professional about the information on OTC drugs. Furthermore, when not sure about which OTC drug to use, 510 participants (65.6%) valued their physician's advice, whereas 480 participants (60.2%) valued their pharmacist's advice.

1313,35246117,"Establishing and evaluating physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics to manage patients with type 2 diabetes in primary hospitals in Hunan province: study protocol of a multi-site randomized controlled trial in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted an unprecedented and universal impact on global health system, resulting in noticeable challenges in traditional chronic disease care, of which diabetes was reported to be most influenced by the reduction in healthcare resources in the pandemic. China has the world's largest diabetes population, and current diabetes management in China is unsatisfactory, particularly in rural areas. Studies in developed countries have demonstrated that physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics are efficient and cost-effective for diabetes management, but little is known if this mode could be adapted in primary hospitals in China. The aim of this proposed study is to develop and evaluate physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary hospitals in Hunan province. METHODS A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics compared with usual care for Chinese patients with T2DM. Six primary hospitals will participate in the study, which will recruit 600 eligible patients. Patients in the intervention group will receive services from both physicians and pharmacists in the collaborative clinics, while the control group will receive usual care from physicians. Patients will be followed up at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th month. Comparison between the two groups will be conducted by assessing the clinical parameters, process indicators and costs on diabetes. A satisfaction survey will also be carried out at the end of the study. DISCUSSION If effective, the physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics can be adapted and used in primary hospitals of China to improve glycemic control, enhance medication adherence, decrease incidence of complications and reduce patients' dependence on physicians. Findings from the present study are meaningful for developing evidence-based diabetes care policy in rural China, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era.

1315,35247147,"Family support-based intervention using a mobile application provided by pharmacists for older adults with diabetes to improve glycaemic control: a randomised controlled trial.  Background Family support is crucial in the care of older patients with diabetes. However, more information is needed to evaluate the potential benefits of family-based intervention through a mobile application by pharmacists in the older diabetes patients. Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of family support-based intervention via a mobile application by pharmacists on clinical outcomes, family behaviour, diabetes knowledge, self-management practices and medication adherence in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital in the south of Thailand with 9 months of follow-up. Family members in the intervention group (n = 78) received diabetes educational courses and encouragement via a mobile application from pharmacists to help their older relatives with diabetes in self-management tasks. The control group received usual care (n = 79). Results As compared to baseline, significant improvements were observed in the intervention patients for glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, family behaviour in diabetes care, diabetes knowledge, self-management practices and medication adherence (P < 0.001). The intervention group showed greater decline in HbA1c levels relative to the control group (- 0.97% vs. - 0.12%; P = 0.001). Significant differences between groups for changes in blood pressure levels including scores of family behaviour, diabetes knowledge, self-management and medication adherence were found (P ≤ 0.001), with the intervention group showing greater improvement. Conclusion Family support intervention via a mobile application by pharmacists is beneficial to diabetes care for older adults.Trial registration number: TCTR20200615001 (date 13 June 2020, retrospectively registered).",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1316,35247148,"Warfarin dosing strategies evolution and its progress in the era of precision medicine, a narrative review.  Background For decades, vitamin K antagonists and specifically warfarin, have been the sole agents used orally to manage thromboembolic conditions, including stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Several factors lead to warfarin dose variability, including genetic and non-genetic factors which made warfarin management challenging especially at the initiation phase. To overcome the challenges with warfarin dosing at initiation, strategies other than conventional or fixed dosing were introduced and explored. Aim In this narrative review, we aim to discuss and critique the different dosing strategies for warfarin at initiation with more focus on genotype-guided warfarin dosing and the most recent supporting evidence for and against its use. Method Medline database was searched from 1965 to July 2021. Articles addressing different warfarin dosing methods were screened for inclusion. Results A number of methods exist for warfarin initiation. Studies comparing different dosing methods for initiation yielded conflicting outcomes due to differences in study design, population studied, comparator, and outcomes measured. Conclusions Looking at the big picture, the use of genetic dosing for warfarin initiation can lead to better outcomes. Whether these better outcomes are clinically or economically beneficial remains controversial.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1317,35247263,"Identifying health-system pharmacy operational process categories and corresponding tasks across a diverse health system using a modified Delphi process. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to identify and build consensus on operational tasks that occur within a health-system pharmacy. METHODS An expert panel of 8 individuals was invited to participate in a 3-round modified Delphi process. In the first round, the expert panel independently reviewed an initial list and provided feedback. All feedback was incorporated into the second round and then reviewed and discussed as a group. The expert panel reviewed an updated list based on feedback from the second round and reached consensus on a final list of operational processes and corresponding tasks. RESULTS All 8 participants agreed to serve on the Delphi expert panel and reviewed an initial list of 9 process categories (hazardous intravenous [IV] medications, nonhazardous IV medications, hazardous oral medications, nonhazardous oral medications, controlled substances, total parenteral nutrition [TPN]/fluid preparations, distribution and delivery, clinical tasks, and miscellaneous operational tasks) and 44 corresponding tasks. Through the Delphi process, 72 new tasks were identified in the first round, while 34 new tasks were identified in the second round. In the third and final round, the expert panel reviewed the updated list of 9 process categories and 150 corresponding tasks, made additional edits, and reached consensus on a final list of 9 processes and 138 corresponding tasks that represented operational work within a health-system pharmacy. CONCLUSION The modified Delphi process effectively identified operational processes and corresponding tasks occurring within hospital pharmacies in a diverse health system. This process facilitated consensus building, and the findings may inform development of an operational workload model.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES Report on the practices of prescribing continuous infusion of heparin sodium by syringe pump in our hospital and shed qualitative light on the protocols used in other French hospitals. METHODS We interviewed prescribers about the protocol they were using through the computerized provider order entry system. At the same time, we asked hospital pharmacists, particularly through a social network, whether in their hospital one or more protocols were used and which ones. RESULTS 81 prescribers responded to our request: 22 indicated prescribing the 25000IU/50mL protocol, 7 the 20000IU/48mL protocol, 2 the 25000IU/48mL protocol and 14 indicated that they had no preference for one of them. Ten responded that they did not prescribe any protocols and 26 left the question unanswered. The responses of 42 pharmacists practicing in other establishments allowed us to identify 16 different protocols. Of these 42 establishments, 10 had at least two protocols. CONCLUSIONS Several protocols for the administration by continuous infusion of heparin sodium with a syringe pump can coexist within a hospital. This diversity is confusing and puts patients and caregivers at risk of medication errors. Among all these protocols, it is not known whether some are riskier than others and research to clarify this unknown is warranted. Defining a national standard concentration of heparin and bringing to the market ready-to-administer solutions are measures to be promoted in order to reduce the risk of errors.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1321,35249052,"[Evaluation of Usefulness of the Tools for Collaboration between Hospital and Community Pharmacists in the Provision of Outpatient Cancer Chemotherapy].  Outpatient cancer chemotherapy is becoming increasingly widely adopted. It is, therefore, essential to strengthen the collaboration between hospital and community pharmacists. Although there have been several reports on the collaboration between these two health care providers in the provision of outpatient cancer chemotherapy, there have been no reports on the usefulness of the tools provided by hospital pharmacists to their community counterparts. Hence, this study examined the usefulness of the Adverse Drug Reaction Information Form, which was provided to insurance pharmacies. The response rate of community pharmacists to the information provided was 80%. The most common content of the information provided was related to supportive care(55.9%). Telephone consultations between community pharmacists and patients were conducted in 20 cases(34.8%)to confirm the symptoms of adverse drug reactions. The telephone follow-up rate for each grade of adverse drug reaction was 34.8% for grade 1 and 45.5% for Grade 2, with the number of Grade 2 adverse drug reaction cases being the highest. These findings demonstrate that collaboration between hospital and community pharmacists using the Adverse Drug Reaction Information Form can help provide high-quality outpatient cancer care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1323,35250327,"Perceived Academic Stress, Causes, and Coping Strategies Among Undergraduate Pharmacy Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background Academic stress is a common problem among medical students, and the COVID-19 health crisis lockdown further worsened it. High academic stress has a negative impact on students learning and overall performance. Objective To assess perceived academic stress, causes, and coping strategies among undergraduate pharmacy students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Khartoum. Data were collected from randomly selected participants using three validated self-administered questionnaires; perceived stress scale, study habits inventory, and mental health inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and descriptive statistics and chi-square were employed. Results The response rate in our study was 99.6% (251/252). About 87% of the participants were females. The majority of participants (92%) experience academic stress, with a mean score (24.99 ± 5.159), the level of academic stress ranging from low (4.3%), moderate (73.2%), to high (22.5%). Approximately 80% of the percipients reported academic stress during all exam times with a mean score (25.33 ± 4.976). The level of academic stress was significantly associated with participants' gender (P-value: 0.042), and living conditions (P-value: 0.001). The most common factors that were significantly associated with academic stress were difficulty in remembering all that is studied (66.7%, P=0.006) and worrying about the exams (54.1%, P=0.011). Moreover, the most frequent strategies used to cope with academic stress were praying (84.4%) and maintaining some control over the situation (61.9%). Conclusion The study revealed a high prevalence of academic stress among percipients.

1324,35250599,"The Impact of a National Stewardship Policy on the Usage Patterns of Key Monitoring Drugs in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis.  Background: The management of Key Monitoring Drugs has become one of important aspects to control the growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in China. The first batch of the China National Key Monitoring Drugs (NKMDs) policy was released in July 2019. However, little is known about the impact of the national stewardship on the trends of NKMDs prescribing practice in hospitals, especially in the Northwestern China. Methods: We collected 8-years of monthly NKMDs usage data from a tertiary hospital between 2014 and 2021. A segmented regression model of interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was used to evaluate the Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) and spending trends of ten NMKDs in the hospital throughout the study period. The pre-implementation period was from January 2014 to November 2019 and the post-implementation period was from December 2019 to June 2021. Results: Prior to the implementation of the NKMDs policy, there was an increasing trend both in DDDs and spending for 8 of 10 NKMDs. The interventions managed by clinical pharmacists after the implementation of the national stewardship policy led to a significant decreasing trend of DDDs in the 19 months following implementation, of 430 fewer DDDs per month in total, compared to the pre-implementation period (p < 0.001). A similar decrease in spending was seen in the post-implementation period, with a trend of $4,682 less total spending on medications in those months compared to the pre-implementation trend (p = 0.003). There was a significant decrease in both monthly DDDs and spending for 6 of the 10 medications in the post-implementation period, while there was a significant increased trend both in monthly DDDs and spending on 1 medication in that period. Conclusion: Using ITS analysis, the total DDDs and spending on 10 NKMDs in this hospital indicated sustained reductions over 19 months after multidimensional interventions under the implementation of the national policy guidance. The national stewardship policy could therefore be considered an effective strategy. Additional comprehensive policies should be introduced to further improve the rational use of NKMDs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1329,35252954,"Community pharmacists' experiences of working during lockdown. Background Transmission of the novel coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2, caused many health services to reach crisis points worldwide. As infection rates rose, many countries implemented 'lockdown' periods where only essential services could remain open; this included community pharmacies in the UK. This study retrospectively explores the experiences of community pharmacists during the first lockdown period of the pandemic in the UK, helping us to learn for the future if another pandemic were to arise. Objective The objectives of this study were to explore the main professional and personal worries and concerns that pharmacists experienced during the first UK lockdown. Key practical issues specific to COVID-19 were investigated: staffing levels, precautionary measures undertaken, workload issues, medicines shortages, support, and guidance. In addition, the perceived effectiveness of support available to community pharmacists was examined. Methods Community pharmacists in the Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire regions of the UK were invited to participate in a semi-structured telephone interview. Participants were recruited until no new themes emerged. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was undertaken using the Framework Approach. Results In total, 29 community pharmacists were interviewed across Stoke-On-Trent and Staffordshire, with interviews lasting on average for 20 min. Fifteen interviewees were from independent pharmacies and 14 from large-chain pharmacies. Five themes emerged from the data: difficulty maintaining staffing levels; precautionary measures undertaken for staff and patients; increase in dispensing volume; dealing with medicines shortages; and perceptions of support varied, with guidance reported to be initially slow and conflicting. Conclusion Overall, this study highlights the crucial role that community pharmacists in the UK played in ensuring patients still received their medication and health advice, despite the challenging circumstances in which they found themselves.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess community pharmacists' knowledge of the therapeutic aspects of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin. Another objective was to study the effect of different demographic factors and relevant characteristics on community pharmacists' knowledge of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted prospectively at community pharmacies in the north of Jordan. Community pharmacists were interviewed using a validated questionnaire consisting of three sections. The first section included demographics and other relevant characteristics. The second and third sections included questions about direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin respectively. RESULTS A total of 251 participants completed the questionnaire. Two-thirds of participants knew that direct oral anticoagulants are available in Jordan (67.3%). Of the pharmacists who were able to state at least one direct oral anticoagulant, 60.9% knew at least one main indication. More than half of participating pharmacists had insufficient knowledge (57.8%). Almost half of participants (48.6%) were able to state the most important monitoring parameter of warfarin, and 30.7% were able to state one medication that interacts with warfarin. More than half of participating pharmacists had insufficient knowledge (64.9%). In addition, the results showed that degree of pharmacy, years of experience, university from which pharmacy degree was obtained, and year of graduation were significantly associated with warfarin knowledge.

However, it often results in complex medication regimens and could easily lead to drug related problems (DRP), suboptimal adherence and reduced treatment efficacy. A structured medication review (SMR) could address these issues and optimize therapy, although little is known about clinical effects in PD patients. OBJECTIVE To analyze whether an SMR improves quality of life (QoL) in PD. METHODS In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, half of the 202 PD patients with polypharmacy received a community pharmacist-led SMR. The control group received usual care. Assessments at baseline, and after three and six months comprised six validated questionnaires. Primary outcome was PD specific QoL [(PDQ-39; range 0 (best QoL) - 100 (worst QoL)]. Secondary outcomes were disability score, non-motor symptoms, general health status, and personal care giver's QoL. Furthermore, DRPs, proposed interventions, and implemented modifications in medication schedules were analyzed. RESULTS No improvement in QoL was seen six months after an SMR, with a non-significant treatment effect difference of 2.09 (-0.63;4.80) in favor of the control group. No differences were found in secondary outcomes. In total, 260 potential DRPs were identified (2.6 (±1.8) per patient), of which 62% led to drug therapy optimization.

Opioid tapering is an essential clinical tool to utilize for a variety of reasons, including safety and analgesic optimization. The need for individualized regimens reveals a corresponding need for healthcare providers who can actively manage patients throughout the process. Pharmacists have taken on an integral role for achieving success in opioid tapering. This survey was conducted to describe the current opioid tapering practices of pain and palliative care pharmacists. A Qualtrics survey was offered to the Society of Pain and Palliative Care Pharmacist members. The majority (87%) indicated they specialized in pain management. Almost all respondents (98%) reported providing tapering recommendations and 82% reported being involved with patient monitoring throughout the taper. The majority (multiple responses could be chosen) noted that the indication for initiating an opioid taper was due to abuse/misuse (91%), reduced overall efficacy (89%), and adverse drug reactions (78%). The most common follow-up intervals during tapering were weekly (15%), every 2 weeks (22%), and every 4 weeks (44%). This practice-based survey, though small, showed that pharmacists in pain management and palliative care are actively involved in opioid tapering.

1335,35255196,"South African healthcare workers' knowledge of dolutegravir's drug-drug interactions in the first year of its rollout: a cross-sectional online survey. INTRODUCTION In December 2019, dolutegravir-based treatment was recommended as first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa. Dolutegravir has clinically significant interactions with several commonly used drugs, such as rifampicin, metformin and cation-containing medicines. National guidelines detail these interactions and how to manage them. While previous international studies have shown low healthcare worker knowledge of drug-drug interactions, there is a paucity of information on antiretroviral interaction knowledge in the South African setting, where much ART is nurse-led. The study aimed to determine this knowledge and to describe which variables were associated with gaps in knowledge. METHODS An anonymous online survey of healthcare workers in the field of HIV was conducted in August/September 2020. The survey was designed, tested and piloted, and included sections on demographics, guideline access and training, interaction knowledge, counselling and the effect of COVID-19. Dissemination was via e-mail and social media (convenience sampling). Descriptive and inferential analysis was done using proportions and the 95% confidence interval to determine relationships between independent and dependent variables. Research ethics approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town's Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC Ref: 357/2020). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In total, 1950 survey responses were included in the analysis - 47.1% nurses, 35.8% doctors and 8.9% pharmacists. When asked whether they were aware that dolutegravir has interactions, 70% said yes, 13.9% said no and 16.1% did not answer. Knowledge of specific interactions and the dosing changes needed was low with a wide range between different drugs: 79.7% knew to double the dolutegravir dose with rifampicin, but with calcium, 5.1% picked both correct dosing options and 33.7% picked one of the two correct options. Access to guidelines and training were positively associated with drug interaction knowledge.

BACKGROUND The inappropriate use of antibiotics significantly contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. There is limited information about the use of antibiotics among parents from rural areas in Peru. This study aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards antibiotics among parents of children < 5 years of age from rural communities in Peru; to explore the association between knowledge and attitudes towards antibiotics and to explore determinants of low knowledge and self-medicating his/her child with antibiotics. METHODS Cross-sectional study in six rural primary health centres in Peru using a self-administered survey. Crude and adjusted Prevalence Ratios (PR), and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were calculated to explore determinants of low knowledge and of having self-medicated his/her child with antibiotics. Linear regression was used to explore the association between knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS A total of 231 parents were included. The largest gap in knowledge was among 183 parents (79%) who did not know that antibiotics cannot cure viral infections. The largest gap in attitudes was among 185 participants (80%) that did not disagree with ""If I want my child to receive antibiotics, I would not be satisfied if the doctor refuses to prescribe them"". More than half of parents (n = 120, 52%) reported having self-medicated his/her child with antibiotics. A positive correlation was found between knowledge and attitudes (Coefficient 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.68) after adjusting for the age and the education of the parent. Parents who were < 20 years old were more likely to have low knowledge about antibiotics (crude PR 2.39, 95% CI 1.32-4.34) compared to those aged > 40 years. Parents who had self-medicated his/her child with antibiotics (n = 120, 52%) were more likely to have purchased antibiotics without prescription (aPR 2.70, 95% CI 1.74-4.19) and to have received antibiotics after the recommendation of a pharmacist (aPR 1.79, 95% CI 1.13-2.82). CONCLUSIONS Knowledge about antibiotics among parents from rural settings in Peru is limited and highlights the need for educational interventions.

1339,35256284,"Implementation and evaluation of social determinants of health practice models within community pharmacy. BACKGROUND While community pharmacies are an ideal setting for social needs screening and referral programs, information on social risk assessment within pharmacy practice is limited. OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to describe 2 social determinant of health (SDoH) practice models implemented within community pharmacies. The secondary objective was to evaluate implementation practices utilizing the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Two pharmacy groups participated in a 3-month study, one in New York (9 pharmacies) and another in Missouri (1 pharmacy). The New York pharmacies implemented an SDoH specialist practice model, in which pharmacy staff members facilitate the program. The Missouri pharmacy implemented a community health worker (CHW) model by cross training their technicians. Each pharmacy developed their program using the Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network Care Model. PRACTICE INNOVATION Both programs expanded the technician role to take on additional responsibilities. The SDoH specialist model partnered with a local independent practice association to create a social needs referral program using a technology platform for closed-loop communication. All workflow steps of the self-contained CHW program were completed within the pharmacy, placing additional responsibility on the CHW and pharmacy staff. EVALUATION METHODS RE-AIM framework dimensions of Reach, Effectiveness, and Adoption. RESULTS Social challenges were identified in 49 of 76 (65%) generated SDoH screenings. The most prevalent social needs reported were affordability of daily needs (33%) and health care system navigation (15%). While most pharmacy staff indicated that workflow steps were clearly defined, assessments and referral tools were identified as potential gaps. While approximately 50% of pharmacy staff were comfortable with their assigned roles and in addressing SDoH challenges, physical and mental health concerns required additional education for intervention. CONCLUSION The successful implementation of community pharmacy SDoH programs connected patients with local resources. Community pharmacies are ideally positioned to expand their public health footprint through SDoH interactions that consequently improve patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1341,35257281,"Polystichum braunii ameliorates airway inflammation by attenuation of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, and pulmonary edema by elevation of aquaporins in ovalbumin-induced allergic asthmatic mice.  Asthma is a chronic inflammation of pulmonary airways associated with bronchial hyper-responsiveness. The study was aimed to validate the folkloric use of Polystichum braunii (PB) against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic and chemical characterization OF both extracts. Allergic asthma was developed by intraperitoneal sensitization with an OVA on days 1 and 14 followed by intranasal challenge. Mice were treated with PB methanolic (PBME) and aqueous extract (PBAE) orally at 600, 300, and 150 mg/kg and using dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) as standard from day 15 to 26. High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector analysis revealed the presence of various bioactive compounds such as catechin, vanillic acid, and quercetin. The PBME and PBAE profoundly (p < 0.0001-0.05) declined immunoglobulin E level, lungs wet/dry weight ratio, and total and differential leukocyte count in blood and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid of treated mice in contrast to disease control. Histopathological examination showed profoundly decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia in treated groups. Both extracts caused significant (p < 0.0001-0.05) diminution of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB and upregulation of aquaporins (1 and 5), which have led to the amelioration of pulmonary inflammation and attenuation of lung edema in treated mice. Both extracts profoundly (p < 0.0001-0.05) restored the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH and reduced the level of MDA dose dependently. Both extracts possessed significant anti-asthmatic action mainly PBME 600 mg/kg might be due to phenols and flavonoids and could be used as a potential therapeutic option in the management of allergic asthma.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1342,35258694,"[Drug therapy safety supported by interprofessional collaboration between ICU physicians and clinical pharmacists in critical care units in Germany : Results of a survey]. BACKGROUND Critically ill patients are particularly susceptible to adverse drug events. International studies show that pharmaceutical care has a positive impact on patient and drug therapy safety. Nationally, the integration of pharmacists into the multidisciplinary team and participation in ward rounds is required. The aim of this work is to assess the scope and extent of pharmaceutical care in intensive care units (ICU) in Germany. METHOD In a literature and database search, 13 relevant pharmaceutical activities were identified. Based on this, an online survey with 27 questions on the implementation of pharmaceutical care in ICU was prepared by a panel of experts. The survey was sent to heads of German ICUs. RESULTS Of the participants, 35.3% (59/167) have established regular pharmaceutical care. Drug information (89.7% [52/58]), pharmaceutical interventions with change of therapy (e.g., ward rounds; 67,2% [39/58]), regular evaluation of prescriptions (medication analysis; 65.5% [38/58]) as well as the monitoring of medication (e.g., side effects, effectiveness, costs; 63.8% [37/58]) were most frequently mentioned. The participants with pharmaceutical care (58/168) graded 7 of 13 but those without (104/168) only two  activities as 'essential/indispensable'. CONCLUSION Only a few ICU in Germany have already integrated ward pharmacists into the multidisciplinary team. Once a pharmaceutical service has been established, a greater role/importance is assigned to several pharmaceutical activities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1343,35260413,"Design and Assessment of Telepharmacy and Telehealth Training in Two Pharmacy Programs.  Objective. To develop and assess the impact of a learning module through the evaluation of students' knowledge of, perceptions of, and intent to provide telepharmacy and telehealth services.Methods. Second and third-year students from two schools of pharmacy completed a telepharmacy and telehealth learning module and discussion questions. A post-survey measured their knowledge, perceptions of, and intent to provide remote services.Results. Students scored an average of 94.8% on a post-knowledge assessment. The Theory of Planned Behavior was used to develop a survey measuring intent to provide remote services. Mean scores (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree) were attitude (M=3.18; SD=0.36), subjective norm (M=3.02; SD=0.43), behavioral control (M=2.67; SD=0.41), and intent (M=2.63; SD=0.59). Thematic analysis of discussion question responses found that students' felt the delivery and quality of care was similar between in-person and remote care. Students felt technology use and troubleshooting, perceived difficulty in building relationships, and the inability to provide device training, medication show-and-tell, and physical exams were differences from face-to-face care. They felt telehealth services would expand in the next five years due to increased access, convenience, and cost savings.Conclusion. Upon completion of a learning module, students were knowledgeable about telepharmacy and telehealth. Students agreed that remote services positively impact patient care and would be well-received by patients and providers. Students had lower intent to offer remote services upon graduation; thus, simulations and service management information should be added to curricula to prepare students for and develop student interest in telepharmacy and telehealth.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1344,35261078,"Expert advice for prescribing cannabis medicines for patients with epilepsy-drawn from the Australian clinical experience.  There is international interest for consensus advice for prescribers working in the field of drug resistant epilepsy intending to trial potential therapies that are nonregistered or off-label. Cannabinoids are one such therapy. In 2017, the New South Wales State Government (Australia) set up a cannabinoid prescribing guidance service for a wide variety of indications, based on known pharmacology together with the relevant new literature as it became available. Increasing interest in cannabis medicines use outside this State over the following 5 years together with a paucity of registration-standard clinical trials, lack of information around dosing issues, drug interactions and biological plausibility meant there remained a large unmet need for such advice. To address the unmet need in epilepsy, and until medicines were registered or regulator quality data were available, it was agreed to bring together a working group comprising paediatric and adult epilepsy specialists, clinical pharmacists., clinical pharmacologists and cannabis researchers from across Australia to develop interim consensus advice for prescribers. Although interim, this consensus advice addresses much of the current practice gap by providing an informed overview of the different cannabis medicines currently available for use in the treatment of epilepsy in paediatric and adult settings, with information on dose, drug interactions, toxicity, type of seizure and frequency of symptom relief. As such it supplements the limited evidence currently available from clinical trials with experience from front-line practice. It is expected that this consensus advice will be updated as new evidence emerges and will provide guidance for a subsequent Guideline.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1345,35261305,"Oral cancer awareness and education within the pharmacy profession.  The incidence of oral cancers are rising in the UK, with early detection a significant positive prognostic factor. The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted patients access to dental services, reducing a potential avenue to diagnosis. Community pharmacists are well positioned to play an expanded role in supporting earlier detection. This study seeks to identify levels of awareness and knowledge of oral cancer amongst community pharmacists, to inform development of educational resources.A cross-sectional digital survey was distributed via social media between August and September 2021. Data were collected on participant's demographics, oral cancer awareness and educational resources relevant to oral cancer. The results obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics in IBM SPSS software.61 pharmacists completed the survey. The majority were female (n = 40; 65.6%) aged 18-30 (n = 33; 54.1%). Less than half of respondents reported feeling confident in recognising risk factors (37.7%; n = 23). A substantial minority (n = 8; 13.1%) incorrectly selected fluoride toothpaste use as a risk factor for oral cancer. Most respondents correctly suggested signposting patients with signs or symptoms of oral cancer to a General Medical or General Dental Practitioner (GDP) (n = 35; 57.3%, n = 46; 75.4%). 91.8% of respondents (n = 56) would welcome an educational resource to support professional development.This study demonstrates a need for further educational resources regarding oral cancer, specifically aimed at community pharmacists.

Background Most patients receiving home care have multimorbidity and tend to be prescribed multiple drugs with the complicated regimen. Family physicians (FPs) are responsible for patients' prescriptions after transition to home care. This study aimed to assess changes in medication regimen complexity and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) made by FPs before and after transition to home care. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in six home care clinics in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. Data from patients aged 65 years and older taking any medication who initiated home care between April 2018 and March 2019 were collected using medical records. The medication regimen complexity index-Japanese version (MRCI-J) score and the presence of PIMs were assessed before and 3 months after transition to home care. Results The mean age of 169 patients was 84.0 years. MRCI-J score and percentage of PIMs remained unchanged between before and 3 months after home care initiation. However, MRCI-J score significantly decreased among patients with polypharmacy, but significantly increased among patients with nonpolypharmacy. In multiple regression analysis, a greater number of medications before home care initiation was associated with a decreasing MRCI-J score, but pharmacist home visit services were not associated with changes in MRCI-J score. Conclusions Our results suggest that FPs involved in home care are trying to adjust prescriptions by simplifying the medication regimen of patients with polypharmacy, and adding symptomatic drugs to those with nonpolypharmacy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1348,35262672,"Provision of externally accredited immunisation certification within an Australian Professional Pharmacy University programme: a survey of graduates on benefits and outcomes. OBJECTIVES In Australia, pharmacists may become authorised immunisers by obtaining additional credentialling from certified providers. Some Australian Universities are providing externally accredited immunisation training to final year pharmacy students. Student satisfaction has been demonstrated, but graduate views on benefits and outcomes are yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to evaluate graduates' perceptions of providing an accredited immunisation certification during their University pharmacy programme. METHODS A survey was sent to Griffith University pharmacy graduates of 2016-2020 inclusive. Respondents who completed the accredited immunisation training at University were asked to rank their agreement with five statements on a five-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). Further information, including free-text responses, was collected on current area of practice and involvement in vaccinations. KEY FINDINGS Of the 46 graduates who completed the survey, 42 (91.3%) completed the accredited immunisation training at University. Statements that the accredited immunisation training was considered a valuable additional offering to the pharmacy programme and the time commitment was worthwhile resulted in a mean agreement of 4.74 ± 0.73 and 4.64 ± 0.76, respectively. The majority of respondents (n = 27, 58.7%) were providing immunisations on a daily, weekly or monthly basis with over half reporting becoming more actively involved in immunisation due to COVID-19.

1350,35262700,"Pharmacists supporting athletes: a scoping review exploring the knowledge, role and responsibilities of pharmacists in preventing the unintentional use of prohibited substances by athletes. BACKGROUND Following the establishment of the World Anti-Doping Agency in 1999, the International Pharmacy Federation (FIP) published guidelines - The Role of the Pharmacist in the Fight against Doping in Sport (2014) - intended for implementation into national standards of practice, to clarify pharmacists' roles in supporting athletes. Despite 7 years since the publication of these guidelines, the extent of practice and knowledge regarding sport pharmacy remains unclear. OBJECTIVES To explore the literature to ascertain knowledge held by pharmacists and pharmacy students regarding anti-doping and to determine current/potential roles and responsibilities for pharmacists in the dissemination of information about, and the reduction in unintentional use of, prohibited substances by athletes. METHOD A literature search of five databases utilising terms such as athlete, performance-enhancing and pharmacist was undertaken. Relevant articles published since 1999 were searched for knowledge, roles and responsibilities of pharmacists. KEY FINDINGS We identified 16 research studies outlining knowledge, as well as roles and responsibilities of pharmacists in assisting athletes. Pharmacists reportedly had limited knowledge of anti-doping organisations and prohibited substances. Roles identified included counselling, education, advice about prohibited substances and dispensing. Responsibilities included medication review and assisting athletes to avoid unintentional ingestion of prohibited substances. CONCLUSION Pharmacists, by training, can play a role in providing accurate medication-related information to athletes to avoid prohibited substances. Key barriers identified were pharmacists' lack of knowledge and the absence of guidelines articulating specific roles and responsibilities for pharmacists, highlighting the need for educational programmes and inclusion of specific responsibilities in national guidelines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1351,35264048,"Therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin in neurosurgery patients, from trough concentration to area under the curve: a retrospective single center cohort study in a tertiary hospital. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin in neurosurgery patients. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, data were collected from patients administered vancomycin after neurosurgery during 2020. Intervention by a pharmacist using an area under the curve (AUC)-based strategy for TDM of vancomycin was started on 1 July 2020. The trough concentration was monitored previously. Data regarding basic demographics, vancomycin application, and TDM were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Ninety and 155 samples were included in the non-intervention and intervention groups, respectively. No difference in baseline characteristics was detected. After intervention, the attainment rate of vancomycin TDM was significantly increased from 36.7% to 52.3%. The intervention resulted in an increased daily vancomycin dose (28.9 vs. 26.7 mg/kg/day), a more reasonable sample extraction time (sixth vs. ninth dose), reductions in dose adjustments (37.4% vs. 54.4%) and preventative applications (66.7% vs. 52.3%), and no difference in kidney function impact. The intervention group had a shorter hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Intervention by a clinical pharmacist using an AUC-based strategy for vancomycin TDM can provide benefits other than pharmacokinetic attainment in neurosurgery patients. Further prospective multi-center studies are needed to establish standardized intervention measures and evaluation indicators.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,

BACKGROUND Psychiatric pharmaceutical care is the provision of pharmaceutical care services to patients with psychiatric related illnesses or disorders. Several studies have demonstrated the positive influence psychiatric pharmaceutical care on patients' clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. This study aimed to examine the extent of psychiatric pharmaceutical care practice in a convenience sample of Malaysian government hospitals and the barriers to the provision of these services. METHODS An anonymous cross-sectional survey of registered pharmacists working at a convenience sample of government hospitals in Malaysia was undertaken from September 2019 to June 2020. RESULTS Pharmacists frequently ensured the appropriateness of the dose (55%), dosage form (47%) and dosing schedule (48%) of the dispensed medications. Most pharmacists infrequently worked with patients and healthcare professionals to develop a pharmacotherapeutic regimen and a corresponding monitoring plan (28%). There was no statistically significant difference in the provision of pharmaceutical care services with respect to gender, age, years of practice, and professional board certification. However, the services offered were influenced by the respondent's education and pharmacy setting. The obstacles perceived by pharmacists included lack of time (89%), shortage of pharmacy staff (87%), the patients' inability to comprehend medical information (85%), insufficient demand and acceptance by patients (82%), the lack of official policies and standardised practice protocols (78%), inaccessibility to the patients' medical records (77%) and the lack of structured communication channels between pharmacists and physicians (75%), the pharmacists lack of knowledge/skills and confidence (78%) and insufficient recognition from physicians to the pharmacists' skills (76%).

The prevalence of health food use is increasing not only among healthy individuals but also among patients. Many patients consume drugs and health foods concomitantly, and most of them use more than one drug and one health food. In this regard, the interactions between drugs and health foods should be addressed. However, it is not clear where healthcare professionals can get sufficient information about the interactions between drugs and health foods. To address this issue, we conducted an online questionnaire about the consultation and attitude concerning and information source of interactions between drugs and health foods among pharmacists and dietitians. Only 29.7% of pharmacists and 14.0% of dietitians always confirmed the use of health foods among their patients, even though they work at pharmacies or hospitals. Regarding concomitant use, 79.2% of pharmacists and 60.2% of dietitians allowed their patients to continue concomitant use, and less than 20% of them advised their patients to avoid concomitant use. Most of them checked the manufacturer's website and could not obtain sufficient information about the interactions between drugs and health foods. However, they utilized the ""Information system on safety and effectiveness for health foods (HFNet),"" which is the website of the National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, to obtain information, if they were aware of this. In conclusion, pharmacists and dietitians need more information about the interactions between drugs and health foods, and HFNet may play an important role as information source.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1355,35264858,"Azithromycin Misuse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan. Objective Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a global pandemic, repurposing known drugs was the quickest way to combat the disease. The initial screening revealed that azithromycin (AZM) might have potential against COVID-19. Although clinical trials did not prove such efficacy, many countries have put AZM within their guidelines for treating COVID-19. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the misuse of AZM in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Results A cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacies in Jordan from March 27 to May 8, 2021, and 184 pharmacies data were collected from the Google forms. During COVID-19, 42.9% of pharmacies sold more than 20 packs of prescribed AZM per month compared to 46.7% of pharmacies used to sell 0-5 packs AZM prescriptions per month before the pandemic. During COVID-19, pharmacists significantly dispensed AZM with and without prescriptions 107% and 127%, respectively, more than before the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Overall, pharmacists stocked 121% more AZM packs during COVID-19 than before the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Additionally, most pharmacists (59.7%) believed that AZM could cure COVID-19 patients. However, using multinomial logistic regression analysis, low-experienced pharmacists were unsure if AZM could positively affect COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05, OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 1.23-11.52). Furthermore, low-experienced pharmacists believed that increased use of AZM for the treatment of viral infections could lead to negative consequences (p < 0.001, OR = 0.161, 95% CI 0.063-0.414). Conclusion This study demonstrated that AZM is misused by physicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan. Since AZM efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 is scarce, there is a need for new guidelines by governmental health authorities to implement strict enforcement of AZM dispensing during COVID-19 to avoid negative consequences of bacterial resistance.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Cow's milk allergy (CMA) and cow's milk intolerance (CMI) are the major cow's milk disorders observed in infants and young children. This study investigates, for the first time, physician knowledge regarding CMA and CMI prevalence, diagnosis, and management in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In addition, we explore the role of goat milk-based formula as an alternative in infants suffering from CMI. METHOD This cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. A convenience sample of 2500 MENA-based physicians received the questionnaire, developed by a working group of pediatric experts. RESULTS 1868 physicians completed the questionnaire, including pediatric specialists (80.8%), training physicians (0.2%), dermatologists (0.1%), family/general physicians (12.9%), neonatologists (3.6%), neurosurgeons (0.2%), allergy nurse specialists (0.3%), pharmacists (2.1%), and public health workers (0.1%). Differentiation between CMA and CMI was recognized by the majority of respondents (80.7%), for which the majority of respondents (35.4%) identified that the elimination and challenge test was the best test to differentiate CMA from CMI, whereas 30.7% and 5.4% preferred the immunoglobulin E (IgE) test and skin prick test, respectively. In addition, 28.5% of respondents reported that there is no confirmatory test to differentiate CMA from CMI. The majority of respondents (47.3%) reported that amino acid-based formula (AAF)/ extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) is the cornerstone for the management of CMA. However, most respondents (33.7%) reported that lactose avoidance was best for the management of CMI. Overall, 65% of the respondents were aware of nutritionally adapted goat's milk formula as an alternative to cow's milk products and 37% would recommend its routine use in infants (≤2 years of age). CONCLUSION The results of this survey demonstrate that the majority of physicians are aware of the underlying pathophysiology and management of CMA and CMI. However, a significant proportion of physicians do not follow the clinical guidelines concerning CMA/CMI diagnosis and management. Notably, this survey identified that goat's milk formulas may offer a suitable alternative to AAF/EHF in infants with CMI as they contain β-casein protein which is easily digestible. In addition, goat's milk formulas contain higher levels of oligosaccharides and medium-chained fatty acids compared with standard cow's milk formulas, yet further clinical trials are warranted to support the inclusion of goat's milk formulas in clinical guidelines.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

By collaboratively reviewing care records, we enrolled 459 residents (mean age, 87) and identified 645 falls, including 146 injurious falls and 16 severe injurious falls requiring inpatient care, incidence: 19.5, 4.4, 0.5 per 100 resident-months, respectively. Medication influenced around three-quarters of all falls, &gt;80% of which were psychotropic drugs. Regularly taking ≥5 medications was a risk factor for the initial falls (HR 1.33: CI 1.00-1.77, p = 0.0048) and injuries after falls (OR 2.41: CI 1.30-4.50, p = 0.006). Our findings on the incidence of falls with and without injury were similar to those in Western countries, where the use of psychotropic medication influenced &gt;50% of falls. Discontinuing unnecessary medication use while simultaneously assessing patient ADLs and comorbidities with physicians and pharmacists may help to avoid falls in nursing homes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1362,35271509,"Team-based strategies to prevent heart failure. PURPOSE OF REVIEW The burden of heart failure (HF) in the United States and worldwide is projected to rise. Prevention of HF can curb the burden of this chronic syndrome, but current approaches are limited. This review discusses team-based strategies aimed to prevent HF. RECENT FINDINGS Individuals at high risk for developing HF can be identified using HF risk scores, biomarkers, and cardiac imaging. Electronic medical records (EMR) can integrate clinical data to estimate HF risk and identify individuals who may benefit most from preventive therapies. Team-based interventions can lead to enhanced adherence to medications, optimization of medical management, and control of risk factors. Multifaceted interventions involve EMR-based strategies, pharmacist- and nurse-led initiatives, involvement of community personnel, polypills, and digital solutions. SUMMARY Team-based strategies aimed to prevent HF incorporate a broad group of personnel and tools. Despite implementation challenges, existing resources can be efficiently utilized to facilitate team-based approaches to potentially reduce the burden of HF.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1363,35272985,"Cognitive and Metacognitive Processes Demonstrated by the Pharmacy Students When Making Therapeutic Decisions.  Objective. To characterize the types of cognitive and metacognitive processes demonstrated by third-year pharmacy students during a therapeutic reasoning activity.Methods. A qualitative, descriptive study following a think-aloud protocol was used to analyze the cognitive (analytical) and metacognitive processes observed by third-year pharmacy students as they completed a 25-minute therapeutic reasoning activity. Using a deductive codebook developed from literature about reasoning, two independent coders characterized processes from audio-recorded, transcribed student think-aloud episodes while making therapeutic decisions about simulated clinical cases.Results. A total of 40 think-aloud episodes were transcribed amongst the cohort. Categorization of the think-aloud transcriptions revealed a series of cognitive analytical and metacognitive processes demonstrated by students during the therapeutic decision-making activity. A total of 1,792 codes were categorized as analytical processes, falling into six major themes: 69% gathering information (1,232/1,792), 13% processing information (227/1,792), 7% making assessments (133/1,792), 1% synthesizing information (19/1,792), 7% articulating evidence (117/1,792) and 4% making a recommendation (64/1,792). In comparison to gathering information, a much lower frequency of processing and assessment was observed by students, particularly for those that were unable to resolve the case. Students' movement between major analytical processes co-occurred commonly with metacognitive processes. Of the 918 codes categorized as metacognitive processes the two major themes were: 28% monitoring for knowledge or emotions (257/918) and 72% controlling the planning of next steps or verification of correct information (661/918). Sequencing the codes and co-occurrences of processes allowed us to propose an integrated cognitive/metacognitive model of therapeutic reasoning for students.Conclusion. This study categorizes the cognitive (analytical) and metacognitive processes engaged during pharmacy students' therapeutic reasoning process. The findings can inform current instructional practices and further research into educational activities that can strengthen pharmacy student therapeutic reasoning skills.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1364,35274083,"Health informatics interventions to minimize out-of-pocket medication costs for patients: what providers want. Objective To explore diverse provider perspectives on: strategies for addressing patient medication cost barriers; patient medication cost information gaps; current medication cost-related informatics tools; and design features for future tool development. Materials and Methods We conducted 38 semistructured interviews with providers (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and administrators) in a Midwestern health system in the United States. We used 3 rounds of qualitative coding to identify themes. Results Providers lacked access to information about: patients' ability to pay for medications; true costs of full medication regimens; and cost impacts of patient insurance changes. Some providers said that while existing cost-related tools were helpful, they contained unclear insurance information and several questioned the information's quality. Cost-related information was not available to everyone who needed it and was not always available when needed. Fragmentation of information across sources made cost-alleviation information difficult to access. Providers desired future tools to compare medication costs more directly; provide quick references on costs to facilitate clinical conversations; streamline medication resource referrals; and provide centrally accessible visual summaries of patient affordability challenges. Discussion These findings can inform the next generation of informatics tools for minimizing patients' out-of-pocket costs. Future tools should support the work of a wider range of providers and situations and use cases than current tools do. Such tools would have the potential to improve prescribing decisions and better link patients to resources. Conclusion Results identified opportunities to fill multidisciplinary providers' information gaps and ways in which new tools could better support medication affordability for patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1365,35274535,"The first thousand days of mother and child: a lifelong investment in oral health!  Obstetricians, gynaecologists, paediatricians, pharmacists, paediatric dentists and hygienists are all health professionals that women encounter during the perinatal period. Today we know that during pregnancy and even earlier-at a pregnancy planning phase-the factors that will influence the future of the child's oral health are established. These are the 1,000 days stretching from conception to the child's second year of life, a time that will influence the health of oral cavity for life, and the foundations for the overall health are laid. In fact, oral health is the result of the ongoing prevention carried out by all the above-mentioned health professionals and operators. Often, dental diseases result from misinformation, mistakes and carelessness that begin in pregnancy and continue for the first few years of life. During pregnancy there is an increased risk for and/or worsening of periodontal diseases and a higher incidence of dental erosion and caries for the mother-to -be. In turn, this can even lead to an increase in pregnancy-related diseases such as premature births and miscarriages. Maternal nutrition, oral hygiene and lifestyle choices are the main elements influencing the health of both the mother and the child. Adequate nutrient levels during crucial periods of fetal development can lead to optimal fetal tissue programming and confer the child a greater protection against chronic diseases later in life. It is therefore imperative to promote information campaigns on these topics to prepare caregivers and women for the perinatal period. A survey carried out in Italy on a sample of women of childbearing age shows widespread misinformation about the oral health of mothers and children. The knowledge of health providers is also unsatisfactory: while most respondents recognise the importance of care during pregnancy, they do not advise patients to have dental check-ups or ask them if they have underwent dental care in the previous 12 months. We are carrying out a similar project with the University of Barcelona and it would be interesting to have data from other countries: we will consider them for immediate publication in our journal. Only by improving our knowledge of different realities we will achieve an effective dissemination of information and reduce the incidence of both pregnancy-related pathologies and those affecting childhood.

AIM This systematic review aimed to provide new insights into how pharmacy spaces, or the architecture of pharmacies, are experienced by pharmacy service users and staff. The review sought to identify environmental factors which may influence service users' and staff participation in community-based pharmacy health services. METHOD Ten databases were searched for English language publications, using a combination of search terms relating to pharmacy service users and staff; pharmacy spaces; and health and social care outcomes. Data from the final selected studies were extracted, thematically analysed using a narrative approach and the quality of each study assessed using the Integrated quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study designs (ICROMS). RESULTS 80 articles reporting 80 studies published between 1994 and 2020 were identified; they were from 28 countries, involving around 3234 community pharmacies, 13,615 pharmacy service users, 5056 pharmacists and 78 pharmacy health staff. Most studies (94%) met the ICROMS minimum score, and half did not meet the mandatory quality criteria. Four themes likely to influence service users' and staff experiences of pharmacy health services were identified: (1) privacy; (2) experience of the physical environment; (3) professional image; and (4) risk of error. CONCLUSION To optimise the delivery and experience of pharmacy health services, these spaces should be made more engaging.

1371,35277361,"Concordance between reported medication taking behavior and prescription instructions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visiting community pharmacies. BACKGROUND Understanding types and frequency of medication taking discrepancies could help design pharmacist interventions to improve adherence, outcomes, and prescribing. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess concordance between participants' descriptions of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medication taking behaviors and prescription instructions. METHODS Continued analysis of previously collected data. Dispensing data from 35 community pharmacies identified participants at the age of ≥ 40 years, with ≥ 1 COPD maintenance medication in the past year and self-reported COPD. Participants completed a survey of demographics, corticosteroid/antibiotic drug use, and symptom scores. Participants listed each medication and described medication taking behavior. COPD severity was classified by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) ABCD categories from exacerbation history and symptoms. Aggregate proportion days covered (PDC) for any 1 maintenance medicine was calculated using 12-month dispensing data. Discrepancies between medication taking and instructions were classified: (1) overuse, (2) underuse, or (3) discontinued by participant (without prescriber knowledge). Descriptive statistics summarized survey results. Chi-square compared discrepancies among long-acting bronchodilators (LABDs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and short-acting bronchodilators (SABDs). RESULTS Most participants (N = 709; 27.6% urban, 70.5% rural) were highly symptomatic (GOLD groups B/D = 89.9%) and high risk (groups C/D = 59.2%). Median medication number was 4. Concordance of ICS and LABD taking behavior with prescriber instructions was 80.6% and 81.8%, respectively (P > 0.05). PDC averaged 0.46 ± 0.37; only 28.7% were adherent (i.e., PDC ≥ 0.80). ICS underuse (11.8%) exceeded LABD (5.5%). LABD discontinuation (7.4%) exceeded ICS (2.7%) or SABD (0.6%). SABD overuse (9.3%) exceeded ICS (3.4%) or LABD (4.3%) (P < 0.5 all comparisons). CONCLUSION Although most were highly symptomatic, high risk, and frequently described correct medication taking behavior, overall adherence was very low. Discrepancies included overuse, underuse, and self-discontinuation. Nonadherence and medication taking discrepancies may increase symptoms, exacerbations, and additional medication prescribing. Potential pharmacist strategies include regularly assessing adherence and differentiating intentional versus nonintentional nonadherence to identify and implement patient-specific interventions to encourage medication taking as prescribed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Pharmacist-participated medication reconciliation proved an effective strategy to decrease the risk of medication discrepancy-related errors. However, it is still under pilot in China and its effectiveness in the Chinese healthcare system remains unclear. This study aims to conduct a pharmacist-participated medication reconciliation intervention for elderly patients in county hospitals in China and to evaluate its effect. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a multicentre, prospective, open-label, assessor-blinded, cluster, non-randomised, controlled study for elderly patients. The study will be conducted in seven county hospitals, and the clusters will be hospital wards. In each hospital, two internal medicine wards will be randomly allocated into either intervention group or control group. Patients in the intervention group will receive pharmacist-participated medication reconciliation, and those in the control group will receive standard care. The primary outcome is the incidence of medication discrepancy, and the secondary outcomes are patients' medication adherence, healthcare utilisation and medical costs within 30 days after discharge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics committee approval of this study was obtained from Peking University Institution Review Board (IRB00001052-21016). We have also obtained ethical approvals from all the participating centres. The findings will be published in scientific and conference presentations.

PURPOSE To explore the perceptions of pharmacists and administrators who had an integral role in designing and operationalizing an integrated community pharmacist hypertension management program with collaboration between an academic medical center and a regional chain community pharmacy. SUMMARY Community pharmacists (n = 3), ambulatory care pharmacists (n = 2), medical directors (n = 2), and health-system (n = 1) and pharmacy (n = 1) administrators reported positive experiences engaging with the hypertension management program. Strengths of the program included comprehensive training by the ambulatory care pharmacists, community pharmacist access to the electronic health record (EHR), and primary care providers who were receptive to referring patients and accepting recommendations from the community pharmacists. All participants felt that the program had a positive outlook and saw opportunity for expansion, such as extended hours of operation, new locations, and additional pharmacists. CONCLUSION Pharmacists are well positioned to extend hypertension management programs from primary care clinics into local pharmacists if they have appropriate training, access to the EHR, and ongoing support from collaborating primary care offices. Additional research using implementation science methods is needed to further test the scalability and replicability of the program among different patient populations, community pharmacies, and health systems.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE To address gender inequality, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) created a steering committee that recommended the collection of baseline and ongoing metrics of pharmacy leadership. The purpose of this study was to quantify gender inequality in distributions of residency program director (RPD) and director of pharmacy (DOP) positions and to investigate gender distributions among recipients of ASHP professional leadership awards. METHODS RPD and DOP information for postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) programs included in the online ASHP Residency directory were collected in December of 2020. Publicly available records were used to collect information on recipients of the Harvey A.K. Whitney Award and John W. Webb Award during the periods 1950-2020 and 1985-2020, respectively. Gender information for RPDs, DOPs, and award recipients was collected from listed pronouns available in public records. A χ 2 test was used for analysis of the collected data. RESULTS A total of 1,176 PGY1 residency programs were included. Of the RPD positions assessed, 66% (n = 775) were filled by women pharmacists (P < 0.0001), while the percentage of DOP leadership positions held by women was 42% (n = 496) (P < 0.0001). Evaluation of data on recipients of the Harvey A.K. Whitney Award and John W. Webb Award revealed the occurrence of female recipients is 19.7% (n = 14) and 16.7% (n = 6), respectively (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION RPD positions have a higher prevalence of being filled by women. DOP positions remain male-dominated and revealed gender inequality among senior-level leadership roles. Pharmacy leadership award analysis identified further gender inequality. The results from the study serve as a baseline of current gender metrics for pharmacy leaderships in hospital systems with PGY1 residency programs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1376,35281136,"Analysis of antimicrobial activity of Karnataka propolis against oral pathogens - An in vitro study. Background Propolis, a natural antibiotic, which is in high demand in dentistry is a resinous substance. The main ingredient of propolis that is required for antibiotic effect is flavonoids and phenolic acids. Although propolis is a promising option for the control of oral microbes with lower related hazards and a good immunomodulator effect, its composition differs considerably depending on its botanical origin, the site and the season of collection. This original research aims to find the chemical composition and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of propolis procured from different places of Karnataka state. The results would help the dentist and the pharmacist to select the best propolis to use as antibiotics in treating oral disease. Materials and Methods Propolis sample from 5 different locations of Karnataka was procured from single apiary in Bangalore. Extraction of propolis using two different extracting solvents was carried out. The total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and MIC of each sample were analyzed. Results Water extract propolis of Sullia and Hubli was highly active against tested organism with the MIC <0.312; alcohol extract of Sullia, Hubli and Chitradurga was moderately active with the MIC between 0.312 and 5 mg/ml. Vijayapura and Bagalkot were least active with the MIC >5 mg/ml at tested concentration. Conclusion Propolis procured from different locations of Karnataka can be used as an antimicrobial agent with varying concentrations. However, when propolis is procured for therapeutic purpose, then it needs to be tested for its chemical composition before being utilized.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1377,35281210,"Medicine Maker: An Outreach Activity for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Health Literacy.  Public engagement in medicine has become more important in promoting population health management and literacy.

Background: The Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS) offers a method to measure the quality of life and satisfaction of patients taking oral anticoagulants. The study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the DASS in Chinese patients on anticoagulation therapy. Methods: The DASS was translated, back-translated, and transculturally adapted into the Chinese version and then administered to participants taking oral anticoagulants in a physician-pharmacist collaborative anticoagulation clinic at a tertiary teaching hospital from October 2019 to December 2020. Reliability was analyzed through Cronbach's alpha (α) and split-half reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the structural validity of the scale. Exploratory factor analysis was performed for items in the scales using the varimax rotation method. Results: A total of 189 patients completed the Chinese version of the DASS. Four dimensions and 23 items were included, with Cronbach's α values of 0.89, 0.81, 0.89, and 0.74 for limitations on physical activities, diet restrictions, hassles and burdens, and positive psychological effect, respectively. Cronbach's α coefficient of whole scale was 0.91. The split-half reliability of this scale is 0.747 (>0.7). Conclusion: The Chinese version of the DASS indicated excellent reliability and validity, compared to the original version.

1379,35282155,"Impact of 'Enhanced' Intermediate Care Integrating Acute, Primary and Community Care and the Voluntary Sector in Torbay and South Devon, UK. Introduction Intermediate care (IC) was redesigned to manage more complex, older patients in the community, avoid admissions and facilitate earlier hospital discharge. The service was 'enhanced' by employing GPs, pharmacists and the voluntary sector to be part of a daily interdisciplinary team meeting, working alongside social workers and community staff (the traditional model). Methods A controlled before-and-after study, using mixed methods and a nested case study. Enhanced IC in one locality (Coastal) is compared with four other localities where IC was not enhanced until the following year (controls), using system-wide performance data (N = 4,048) together with ad hoc data collected on referral-type, staff inputs and patient experience (N = 72). Results Coastal showed statistically significant increase in EIC referrals to 11.6% (95%CI: 10.8%-12.4%), with a growing proportion from GPs (2.9%, 95%CI: 2.5%-3.3%); more people being cared for at home (10.5%, 95%CI: 9.8%-11.2%), shorter episode lengths (9.0 days, CI 95%: 7.6-10.4 days) and lower bed-day rates in ≥70 year-olds (0.17, 95%CI: 0.179-0.161). The nested case study showed medical, pharmacist and voluntary sector input into cases, a more holistic, coordinated service focused on patient priorities and reduced acute hospital admissions (5.5%).

BACKGROUND Evaluating pharmacy services from the perspective of the end user-patients-is imperative for ensuring the sustainability of services. OBJECTIVES This study evaluated patient feedback regarding an evidence-based community pharmacist-delivered Pharmacy Asthma Service (PAS), in terms of overall satisfaction, satisfaction with PAS delivery, and perceived impact, and explored determinates of satisfaction. METHODS All patients who received the 12-month PAS (n = 143) were invited to provide feedback via a project-specific patient evaluation survey upon completion of the final consultation. The survey included a mix of 5-point Likert-type scale items, multiple-choice questions, and free-text response questions. Overall satisfaction was determined by a single 5-point Likert-type scale question. Satisfaction with service delivery and overall impact were assessed using a 4-item and 8-item Likert-type scale, respectively, and a summative score computed for each section. Patient PAS data including demographics and management outcomes were then cross tabulated against overall satisfaction, satisfaction with PAS delivery, and impact. RESULTS Feedback was received from 71% (n = 101) of patients who completed the PAS. The results indicated high overall patient satisfaction, with 86% of respondents very satisfied with the service. Patients identified positive impacts of the PAS including improved understanding and management of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Similarly, almost all patients were satisfied with service delivery including the pharmacist's knowledge and their ability to assist (98%) and the privacy of the pharmacy setting (91%). Patients who had controlled asthma at the end of the trial had higher levels of overall satisfaction (χ2 = 9.584, df = 5, P = 0.048) and reported greater overall impact on asthma and allergic rhinitis management (U = 1593.5, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION The diffusion of health services within community pharmacy practice is dependent upon patient receptivity and how the services align with patient needs. The positive satisfaction received indicates that the PAS would be welcomed by patients with asthma in future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1381,35284082,"Development and Feasibility of a Multidisciplinary Approach to AKI Survivorship in Care Transitions: Research Letter. Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) survivors are at heightened risk for poor short- and long-term health outcomes. Even among those who recover after an AKI episode, the risk for chronic kidney disease is 4- to 6-fold higher than in patients without AKI, underscoring the importance of identifying methods to improve AKI survivorship. Objective The purpose of this report was to describe the development and feasibility of a novel multidisciplinary approach to caring for AKI survivors at care transitions (ACT). Design Observational process improvement initiative. Setting Single academic medical center in the United States. Patients The studied population was adults with stage 3 AKI not discharging on dialysis who were established with a primary care provider (PCP) at our institution. Methods An electronic health record tool was developed prior to implementation to identify AKI survivors. The ACT program encompassed engaging patients in the hospital, delivering education by nephrology-trained nurses before discharge, completing recommended laboratory testing after discharge, and conducting structured kidney-focused follow-up with a pharmacist and a PCP within 7 to 14 days after discharge. Patients could be referred for nephrology evaluation at the discretion of the PCP. Results Preliminary data demonstrated that most AKI survivors of interest could be identified, educated, and followed up with this model. This strategy appeared feasible, scalable, and maximized the unique expertise of each member of the multidisciplinary team. Limitations Small sample size, future assessment of process, clinical, and patient-reported outcomes needed.

Comparing with pre-intervention group, the post-intervention group patients had a significantly lower incidence of vancomycin associated AKI: 7.3% for post- and 9.6% for pre-intervention (OR 0.52, 95% CI. [0.41-0.67], P < 0.00001). The rate of attaining target concentration was significantly higher in the post- than pre-intervention group (OR 2.86, 95% CI. [2.23, 3.67], P < 0.00001). The post-intervention group significantly improved the percentage of serum creatinine laboratory tests than pre-intervention group (OR = 3.24, 95% CI. 2.02-5.19], P < 0.00001). Patients with post-intervention had markedly lower risk of mortality than pre-intervention patients (OR 0.47, 95% Cl. [0.31, 0.72], P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS Pharmacist intervention in vancomycin treatment significantly decreased the rate of vancomycin associated AKI, while improving efficacy and reducing mortality. We speculate it is due to that the pharmacist interventions optimized the rationality of vancomycin therapy, monitoring of vancomycin trough concentration and the monitoring of patients' renal function.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
1385,35286053,"Validation of a method to assess the severity of medication administration errors in Brazil: a study protocol. BACKGROUND Medication errors are frequent and have a high economic and social impact and is critical to know their severity. A variety of tools exist to measure and classify the harms associated with medication errors, but few are internationally validated. DESIGN AND METHODS It was decided to validate a method proposed by Dean and Barber for assessment of the potential severity of medication administration errors. A number of thirty health care professionals (doctors, nurses and pharmacists) from Brazil will receive an invitation to take part by scoring 50 cases of medication errors gathered from an original UK study regarding their potential harm to the patient on scale 0 to 10. Sixteen cases with known actual harm outcomes will be used to assess the validity of their scoring. By looking at 10 errors (out of the 50 cases) scored twice, reliability shall be assessed; and potential sources of variability in scoring will be evaluated depending on the severity of each of error case, the occasion when the scores were given, the scorer, their profession, and interactions among these variables. Generalizability theory will be used for analysing data. Expected impact of the study for public health: This study was submitted to the evaluation of the Research Ethics Committee of the Complexo Hospitalar Universitário Professor Edgard Santos and approved under no. 3.102.570/2019. This is the first validation of this method for use in Brazil, and will allow researchers to conduct more standardised evaluations of interventions to reduce the impact of medication errors.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1386,35286905,"Factors influencing clinician prescribing of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for inflammatory arthritis: A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.  Understanding factors that influence prescribing of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) will inform strategies to optimise care of people with inflammatory arthritis. We performed a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies to explore these factors. Inclusion criteria were: use of qualitative or mixed methods; rheumatologist, nurse or pharmacist perspectives; prescription of any DMARD (conventional [cs], targeted synthetic [ts], biologic [b], biosimilars) and/or glucocorticoids; in any healthcare setting in any country. MEDLINE, Embase and EBSCOhost CINAHL Plus were searched from inception to 15 June 2021. Pairs of review authors independently identified studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, and extracted and thematically synthesised data. Confidence in synthesis themes was evaluated using the GRADE Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) approach. We included 15 studies involving 716 clinicians (683 rheumatologists, 27 nurses, 6 pharmacists) across 10 countries, all focusing on management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Six themes were identified: Rheumatologist prescribing is influenced by patients' characteristics, preferences, symptoms and negative responses to medication; Rheumatologist knowledge, experience, habits and subjective judgements are strong drivers of prescribing behaviour; High demands on consultation time impede shared decision-making; Costs and complexity of medication funding arrangements limit prescribing options; Clinicians recognise the importance of providing patient education about medication options; and Clinicians value colleagues' opinions and support to inform prescribing decisions. The majority of themes were graded as moderate confidence (n  =  4), reflecting they are likely to reasonably represent the factors influencing prescribing of DMARDs to people with RA. Quality improvement strategies that address these factors are likely to support best practice pharmacologic management of RA and may be potentially applicable to other types of inflammatory arthritis. High demand on consultation time and complexity of medication funding arrangements are system factors that may or may not be amenable to change. Easily accessible living national guidelines which include lay summaries and treatment algorithms to support prescribing decisions may address some of the themes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1387,35287746,"Consumers' adverse drug event reporting via community pharmacists: three stakeholder perception. BACKGROUND Adverse drug event (ADE) reporting is a significant process to increase consumer care and consumer safety associated with the use of medicines. An in-depth investigation into low ADE reporting by consumers and community pharmacists was undertaken to uncover interventions to improve reporting. METHOD In-depth interviewing of the three parties; consumers, pharmacists and employees of the Pharmacovigilance Center in Thailand, was used to collect the data. They were interviewed about ADE reporting experiences and contributing factors and problems of ADE reporting. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the results. RESULT The HPVC received few ADE reports from consumers. Most community pharmacists received ADE reports from consumers; however, the Pharmacovigilance Center received few ADE reports from community pharmacists. ADE reporting of community pharmacists and consumers were influenced by many factors which were categorized into four themes which were (1) ""Cognition"" (awareness, attitude and responsibility); (2) ""Reporting process"" (complication, competency, information deficiency, feedback, and resource); (3) ""Inducer"" (service orientation, acquaintanceship, motivation, severity level, regulatory and reward); and (4) ""Obstacle"" (doubt, belief and prosecution). CONCLUSION Health professionals should motivate consumers to report ADEs. Building social responsibility and benefits and increasing knowledge of reporting process, channels, and system to both community pharmacists and consumers were recommended. Providing rewards and making community pharmacists feel comfortable to report ADEs by simplifying the ADE form and providing training, guidelines, and an ADR assessment tool can drive them to report ADEs. Feedback to consumers by confirming whether it was ADE and feedback to pharmacists that the Pharmacovigilance Center received their reports and their reports were utilized were also important.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1388,35287764,"Preparing for the spread of patient-reported outcome (PRO) data collection from primary care to community pharmacy: a mixed-methods study. BACKGROUND Medication non-adherence is a significant public health problem. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) offer a rich data source to facilitate resolution of medication non-adherence. PatientToc™ is an electronic PRO data collection software originally implemented at primary care practices in California, United States (US). Currently, the use of standardized PRO data collection systems in US community pharmacies is limited. Thus, we are conducting a two-phase evaluation of the spread and scale of PatientToc™ to US Midwestern community pharmacies. This report focuses on the first phase of the evaluation. The objective of this phase was to prepare for implementation of PatientToc™ in community pharmacies by conducting a pre-implementation developmental formative evaluation to (1) identify potential barriers, facilitators, and actionable recommendations to PatientToc™ implementation and (2) create a draft implementation toolkit. METHODS Data collection consisted of demographics, observations, audio-recorded contextual inquiries, and semi-structured interviews with staff (e.g., primary care providers, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians) and patients during 1-day site visits to a purposive sample of (1) primary care practices currently using PatientToc™ and (2) community pharmacies in Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota interested in the future use of PatientToc™. Post-visit site observation debriefs were also audio-recorded. Verbatim transcripts of all recordings were coded using deductive/inductive approaches and intra-/inter-site summaries were produced identifying potential barriers, facilitators, and actionable recommendations mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs. A stakeholder advisory panel engaged in an Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) implementation process. This included ""member checking"" and prioritizing findings, and feedback on the adapted PatientToc™ application, implementation strategies, and accompanying toolkit for community pharmacy implementation. RESULTS Two primary care practices, nine pharmacies, and 89 individuals participated. Eight major themes (four barriers and four facilitators) and 14 recommendations were identified. Throughout the four EBQI sessions, the panel (1) confirmed findings; (2) designated high priority recommendations: (a) explain PatientToc™ and its benefits clearly and simply to patients, (b) ensure patients can complete questionnaires within 10 min, and (c) provide hands-on training/resources for pharmacy teams; and (3) provided feedback on the adapted PatientToc™ application and finalized toolkit items for initial community pharmacy implementation. CONCLUSIONS Adoption of electronically captured PROs in community pharmacies is warranted. The implementation strategies systematically developed in this study can serve as a model for implementation of technology-driven health information patient care services, in the understudied context of community pharmacies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1389,35287972,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the lipid control of the patients that start PCSK9 inhibitors. OBJECTIVES MEMOGAL study (NCT04319081) is aimed at evaluating changes in cognitive function in patients treated with PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i). This is the first analysis: (1) discussion about the role of the Hospital Pharmacists during the pandemic, and also the assessment of the impact of COVID-19 in the lipid control; (2) descriptive analysis; (3) effectiveness in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) reduction of alirocumab and evolocumab; (4) communicate PCSK9i safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS It is a prospective Real-World Evidence analysis of patients that take PCSK9i for the first time in the usual clinical practice, and they are included after the first dispensation in the public pharmacy consultations of 12 Hospitals in Galicia from May 2020 to April 2021. Baseline values of LDL-c are the previous values before taking PCSK9 and the follow-up values are in 6 months time. RESULTS 89 patients were included. 86.5% with cardiovascular disease and 53.9% with statin intolerances. 78.8% of the patients were treated with high intensity statins. Statins most used were rosuvastatin (34.1%) and atorvastatin (20.5%). Baseline value of LDL-c was 148mg/dL and the follow-up value was 71mg/dL. The baseline value of patients treated with alirocumab (N=43) was 144mg/dL and 73mg/dL in the follow-up. With evolocumab (N=46) was 151mg/dL in basaline and 69mg/dL in follow-up. The LDLc- reduction was 51.21% with evolocumab and 51.05% with alirocumab. 43.1% of the patients showed values >70mg/dL in six month time; 19.4% between 69mg/dl and 55mg/dL and 37.5% <55mg/dL. 58.3% of the patients achieved a reduction >50% of LDL-c. The adverse events were: injection point reaction (N=2), myalgias (N=1), flu-like symptoms (N=1) and neurocognitive worsening (N=1). CONCLUSIONS (1) Despite the number of prescriptions was reduced because of the pandemic, the lipid control was not affected. (2) Half of the patients treated with PSCK9i is due to statins intolerance and the 86% is for secondary prevention. (2) The reduction results were similar to pivotal clinical trials. Despite this, 39% of the total of the patients and 60% of patients with dual teraphy did not reach the goal of ESC/EAS guidelines (<55mg/dL and/or reduction>50%). There were not significant differences between evolocumab and alirocumab: 51.21% vs 51.05% (P=.972). (3) There were not any adverse events of special interest.

BACKGROUND Potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) in elderly patients is highly prevalent and is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events, morbidity, and mortality. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the PIP encountered in a geriatric setting and to highlight the role of the clinical pharmacists in this context. METHOD A retrospective observational study was conducted during March and April 2018 in an elderly daycare in Beirut area. Patients' files were screened to evaluate each patient's clinical status using a developed tool that included the Medication Appropriateness Index. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 20). The results were considered significant at p<0.05. RESULTS The results showed a high incidence of hypertension, schizophrenia, and diabetes among the studied sample with percentages of 41.7%, 35.3%, and 26.6%, respectively. As for the PIP, drug therapy duration and cost were the most encountered problems followed by medication indication, dosage, and drug-drug interaction. Moreover, PIP increased with the number of prescribed medications (p<0.05). Proton pump inhibitors, low dose aspirin, and antidiabetic medications' users had a significantly higher Medication Appropriateness Index score as compared to non-users.. CONCLUSION As a conclusion, suboptimal care is proved in this study empowering the collaboration between clinical pharmacists and physicians in minimizing the PIPs in elderly daycares.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1391,35288835,"Pleiotropic effects of AT-1 receptor antagonists in hypoxia induced by cardiac ischaemia.  The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role and coordinates multiple body functions through its hormonal mechanism. The RAS is supported in its function by numerous peptides such as angiotensin II (Ang II), Ang IV, Ang III, angiotensin (1-7) and (1-9). The system formed by ACE2/Ang(1-7)/MASr is a regulatory pathway within the RAS system and its functions are different from those of the ACE/Ang II/AT-1r system. Recently, it has been discovered that a key role of the RAS and the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/MASr system is in inflammatory processes such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Studies are ongoing to better understand and comprehend the function of the RAS in inflammation. Recent evidence associates AT-1r antagonists with a cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertrophic role. In this in vitro study, we demonstrate the protective role of treatment (50 and 200 μM) of an AT-1r antagonist, irbesartan, on hypoxia and inflammation-induced damage in cardiomyocytes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1392,35289036,"Endo-M Mediated Chemoenzymatic Approach Enables Reversible Glycopeptide Labeling for O-GlcNAcylation Analysis.  To selectively enrich O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) peptides in their original form from complex samples, we report the first reversible chemoenzymatic labeling approach for proteomic analysis. In this strategy, the O-GlcNAc moieties are ligated with long N-glycans using an Endo-M mutant, which enables the enrichment of the labeled glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The attached glycans on the enriched glycopeptides are removed by wild-type Endo-M/S to restore the O-GlcNAc moiety. Compared with the classic chemoenzymatic labeling, this approach enables the tag-free identification, and eliminates the interference of bulky tags in glycopeptide detection. This approach presents a unique avenue for the proteome-wide analysis of protein O-GlcNAcylation to promote its mechanism research.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM To validate and update the risk score originally developed at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, verifying its performance in an infectious disease population. METHODS This is an observational study with consecutive selection of admission in a ward of participants with infectious diseases. Predictors were age, number of medications, intravenous drugs, potentially dangerous drugs, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, use of nasogastric tube, nasogastric tube, gastrostomy feeding, jejunostomy feeding, oral enteral tube, total parenteral nutrition, cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction and immunosuppression. Outcome was defined as preventable prescription incidents by a clinical pharmacist. A GEE model was fit to make predictions each week. RESULTS 219 patients participated in the study. 79.25% of the participants had prescription incidents in the first week of admission. Predictors of the updated model were number of drugs prescribed, number of intravenous drugs, use of tubes, truncated age at 36 years and week of hospitalization. The performance of the original model was poor. The updated model's descrimination and calibration were moderate (overall AUC 0.74). A calculator to apply the model is available at https://pedrobrasil.shinyapps.io/INDWELL/.

The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and characteristics of discharge medication discrepancies as identified by pharmacists during discharge medication reconciliation. We also attempted to identify the factors that influence the occurrence of drug discrepancies during medication reconciliation. From June to December 2019, a prospective study was performed at the cardiac center of King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh. The information from discharge prescriptions as compared to the medication administration record (MAR), medication history in the cortex system, and the patient home medication list collected from the medication reconciliation form on admission. The study included all adult patients discharged from KFMC's cardiac center. These participants comprised 776 patients, 64.6 percent of whom were men and 35.4 percent of whom were women. Medication discrepancies were encountered in 180 patients (23.2%) out of 776 patients. In regards to the number of discharged medications, 651(83.9%) patients had ≥ 5 medications. Around, 174 (73.4%) discrepancies were intentional, and 63 (26.6%) were unintentional discrepancies. The risk of unintentional medication discrepancy was increased with an increasing number of medications (P-value = 0.008).

1395,35290392,"Community pharmacists' attitudes toward practice-based research and their perceived utilization of scientific evidence. BACKGROUND Enhancing the contribution of practicing pharmacists into scientific evidence via practice-based research (PBR) is crucial in maintaining high-quality clinical practice and healthcare delivery. Involving community pharmacists in PBR can potentially can also help break barriers to the utilization of the current best evidence in everyday pharmacy practice. The impact of pharmacists' attitude towards PBR on their utilization of current best evidence in pharmacy practice is understudied. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of community pharmacists' attitudes toward PBR on their utilization of current best evidence, barriers for conducting PBR in clinical practice were also investigated. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 169 community pharmacists working across Jordan filled a questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards PBR, barriers to PBR, and their utilization of the current best evidence in clinical practice. RESULTS Pharmacists in this study showed a positive attitude toward PBR (attitude mean score >3.5). A positive attitude towards PBR was associated with high utilization of the best current scientific evidence. We also investigated several barriers to PBR and their association with utilization those included; the lack of perceived benefits, lack of institutional support, and lack of self-engagements of community pharmacists to PBR. The lack of perceived benefit was found to be negatively associated with pharmacists' utilization of the current best scientific evidence. CONCLUSION In this study, pharmacists' utilization of current best evidence was found to be significantly impacted by their attitude toward PBR. The current study findings highlight the importance of supporting, promoting, and facilitating PBR among community pharmacists which can potentially enhance their utilization of the current best evidence in their everyday pharmacy practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1397,35290653,"Enhancing Patient Care II: The Clinical Impact of Medical Information Services. BACKGROUND Understanding the ways that healthcare providers (HCPs) utilize medical information received from the pharmaceutical industry is important so that the information can be tailored and customized to meet the HCPs needs. Additionally, this understanding supports the value of the information provided. The purpose of this study was to collect opinions of HCPs who recently requested information from a manufacturer's Medical Information (Med Info) Service. HCPs provided their opinions on the perceived quality, relevance, impact on patient care, and intended usage of information. METHODS HCPs who recently requested medical information from one of eight participating companies received a Survey Monkey link in the information response. Data collected included demographics, perceived quality, relevance, impact on patient care, and intended usage of the information. Data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. RESULTS Over a 14-month period, 246 HCPs responded to the survey. Eight companies participated in the survey. Customer responses to the survey ranged from 2 to 97 per company. A total of 99 pharmacists, 68 physicians, 22 registered nurses, 21 nurse practitioners, 8 physician assistants, and 28 others participated in the survey. Most HCPs (208/227, 92%) contacted the company Med Info Group 1-5 times in the last six months and 67% (159/238) had been in practice greater than 10 years. Most HCPs rated the following quality areas as a 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale: timeliness (195/225, 87%), trustworthiness (189/221, 86%), conciseness (185/221, 84%), clarity (180/222, 81%), relevance (178/223, 80%), and completeness (173/222, 78%). The most common reason for contacting Med Info Services was to advance knowledge or education (110/228, 48%). Additional reasons were at the point of care (60/228, 26%), for a specific patient (not at point of care) (60/228, 26%), and to reflect on a treatment decision (59/228, 26%). The relevance of the information provided was utilized for the HCPs own education (99/226, 44%), shared with peers (91/226, 40%), or used for future treatment decisions (88/226, 39%). The information provided enhanced patient care by enabling the HCPs to educate patients more effectively (86/222, 39%), efficacy of treatment regimen was enhanced (70/222, 32%), or other positive impact (65/222, 29%). CONCLUSION The opinions of HCPs who are using Medical Information Services are overall positive. All the quality indicators were rated as a 4 or 5 by the majority of HCPs, with the lowest in completeness (173/222, 78%) and the highest in timeliness (195/225, 87%). Medical Information Services were utilized to advance knowledge/education of the HCP, followed closely by the care of a current or future patient. However, when queried on the relevant use of the information in their practice, the most common answers were for their own education or to share with peers. The impact on patient care was focused on enabling the HCP to educate patients more effectively. The value of medical information is difficult to quantify. Understanding the quality assessment, utilization, and the impact on patient care by HCPs can provide a broad descriptor of value.

1398,35291005,"Virtual clinical pharmacy services: A model of care to improve medication safety in rural and remote Australian health services. PURPOSE To describe a virtual clinical pharmacy service as a model of care to support rural and remote Australian hospitals that otherwise would not have access to onsite pharmacists. SUMMARY Many small hospitals in Australia do not have an onsite hospital pharmacist and struggle to support and optimize patient care. To increase access to a hospital pharmacist's specialized skills and medication knowledge, a virtual clinical pharmacy service was designed and implemented in 8 hospitals across rural New South Wales, Australia in 2020. The virtual clinical pharmacy service focuses on the core role of hospital pharmacists, including obtaining a best possible medication history, medication reconciliation at transitions of care, medication review, interprofessional team meetings, provision of patient-friendly medication lists, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient and clinician education. The model is aligned with recognized standards of practice for the delivery of clinical pharmacy services in Australian hospitals. This article details a model of care for translation across other settings. It provides the necessary details on clinical services, processes, supporting structures, an evaluation framework, and other important considerations for implementing virtual pharmacy services. CONCLUSION This research provides policymakers, health service planners, and practitioners with a model for providing comprehensive clinical pharmacy services virtually to increase the safe and effective use of medicines.

1399,35291025,"Hospital physicians' and older patients' agreement with individualised STOPP/START-based medication optimisation recommendations in a clinical trial setting. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the agreement of hospital physicians and older patients with individualised STOPP/START-based medication optimisation recommendations from a pharmacotherapy team. METHODS This study was embedded within a large European, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial examining the effect of a structured medication review on drug-related hospital admissions in multimorbid (≥ 3 chronic conditions) older people (≥ 70 years) with polypharmacy (≥ 5 chronic medications), called OPERAM. Data from the Dutch intervention arm of this trial were used for this study. Medication review was performed jointly by a physician and pharmacist (i.e. pharmacotherapy team) supported by a Clinical Decision Support System with integrated STOPP/START criteria. Individualised STOPP/START-based medication optimisation recommendations were discussed with patients and attending hospital physicians. RESULTS 139 patients were included, mean (SD) age 78.3 (5.1) years, 47% male and median (IQR) number of medications at admission 11 (9-14). In total, 371 recommendations were discussed with patients and physicians, overall agreement was 61.6% for STOPP and 60.7% for START recommendations. Highest agreement was found for initiation of osteoporosis agents and discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors (both 74%). Factors associated with higher agreement in multivariate analysis were: female gender (+ 17.1% [3.7; 30.4]), ≥ 1 falls in the past year (+ 15.0% [1.5; 28.5]) and renal impairment i.e. eGFR 30-50 ml/min/1.73 m2; (+ 18.0% [2.0; 34.0]). The main reason for disagreement (40%) was patients' reluctance to discontinue or initiate medication. CONCLUSION Better patient and physician education regarding the benefit/risk balance of pharmacotherapy, in addition to more precise and up-to-date medical records to avoid irrelevant recommendations, will likely result in higher adherence with future pharmacotherapy optimisation recommendations.

1400,35291316,"Characteristics of Post-ICU and Post-COVID Recovery Clinics in 29 U.S. Health Systems.  The multifaceted long-term impairments resulting from critical illness and COVID-19 require interdisciplinary management approaches in the recovery phase of illness. Operational insights into the structure and process of recovery clinics (RCs) from heterogeneous health systems are needed. This study describes the structure and process characteristics of existing and newly implemented ICU-RCs and COVID-RCs in a subset of large health systems in the United States. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING Thirty-nine RCs, representing a combined 156 hospitals within 29 health systems participated. PATIENTS None. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS RC demographics, referral criteria, and operating characteristics were collected, including measures used to assess physical, psychologic, and cognitive recoveries. Thirty-nine RC surveys were completed (94% response rate). ICU-RC teams included physicians, pharmacists, social workers, physical therapists, and advanced practice providers. Funding sources for ICU-RCs included clinical billing (n = 20, 77%), volunteer staff support (n = 15, 58%), institutional staff/space support (n = 13, 46%), and grant or foundation funding (n = 3, 12%). Forty-six percent of RCs report patient visit durations of 1 hour or longer. ICU-RC teams reported use of validated scales to assess psychologic recovery (93%), physical recovery (89%), and cognitive recovery (86%) more often in standard visits compared with COVID-RC teams (psychologic, 54%; physical, 69%; and cognitive, 46%). CONCLUSIONS Operating structures of RCs vary, though almost all describe modest capacity and reliance on volunteerism and discretionary institutional support. ICU- and COVID-RCs in the United States employ varied funding sources and endorse different assessment measures during visits to guide care coordination. Common features include integration of ICU clinicians, interdisciplinary approach, and focus on severe critical illness. The heterogeneity in RC structures and processes contributes to future research on the optimal structure and process to achieve the best postintensive care syndrome and postacute sequelae of COVID outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1402,35292212,"Increasing use of immunization information systems for routine vaccinations in independent community pharmacies: A randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND Only 60% of adults nationwide and just 36.8% of adults in Alabama have immunization data recorded in an Immunization Information System (IIS). The objective of this study, which took place before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, was to evaluate the impact of an IIS training program on pharmacists' IIS enrollment, participation, awareness, knowledge, intention, and attitudes. METHODS A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2019 among Alabama pharmacists (N = 41) practicing in independently owned pharmacies and providing vaccination services but whose pharmacy was not enrolled in Alabama's IIS (Immunization Patient Registry with Integrated Technology [ImmPRINT]). Intervention pharmacists were offered a 2-hour IIS training program, including an online continuing pharmacy education article, demonstration videos, implementation guide, and informational flyer. Control pharmacies received the informational flyer only. Pharmacy-level outcomes, including enrollment and participation, were obtained from ImmPRINT administrative records. Pharmacist-level outcomes, including awareness, knowledge, intention, and attitudes, were self-reported using baseline, 1-month, and 3-month surveys. Two-way mixed analysis of variance, chi-square, and independent t tests were used to analyze differences in outcomes between and within groups. RESULTS Enrollment in ImmPRINT was significantly greater among intervention pharmacists' pharmacies (P = 0.035). In particular, 59.1% of intervention pharmacies compared with 26.3% of control pharmacies were enrolled in ImmPRINT at 3 months. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in terms of participation in ImmPRINT. Intervention pharmacists' awareness of IIS was significantly greater than control pharmacists (P = 0.028) at 1 month (postintervention). Furthermore, the IIS training program significantly improved intervention pharmacists' knowledge (P = 0.030) and attitudes (P = 0.016) toward IIS over 3 months compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS This pharmacist-centered training program focused on practical strategies to integrate IIS into pharmacy workflow. Results show that pharmacists' enrollment, awareness, knowledge, and attitudes significantly improved as a result of this training. As pharmacists become more involved in immunization efforts, particularly in response to COVID-19, awareness of and participation in responsible immunization documentation are critical.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1403,35292260,"Perioperative cefazolin prophylaxis in paediatric cardiac surgery: a prospective, cohort study. BACKGROUND This study's objective was to determine the effect of age, prolonged bypass, and hypothermia on serum cefazolin concentrations in children undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS A prospective, single-centre, observational study was conducted. Children undergoing cardiac surgery were examined. Participants received cefazolin intravenously approximately 1 hour before skin incision, 3 hourly intraoperatively and 8 hourly postoperatively. Blood samples were collected at 6-8 timepoints intraoperatively and 6-time points in the first 24 hours postoperatively. Target unbound serum cefazolin concentrations were of 2 mg/L. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study, and 64 included in the analysis. All maintained concentrations ≥ 2 mg/L throughout the operation. Nineteen patients (30%) did not maintain concentrations ≥ 2 mg/L in the first 24 hours following surgery. Older, larger children (p < 0.0001) were significantly less likely to achieve target unbound serum cefazolin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative cefazolin concentrations reached the target concentration in all paediatric cardiac surgical cases. Postoperative cefazolin dosing appears insufficient to achieve minimum inhibitory concentrations in many patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1404,35292455,"PEER simplified chronic pain guideline: Management of chronic low back, osteoarthritic, and neuropathic pain in primary care. OBJECTIVE To develop a clinical practice guideline to support the management of chronic pain, including low back, osteoarthritic, and neuropathic pain in primary care. METHODS The guideline was developed with an emphasis on best available evidence and shared decision-making principles. Ten health professionals (4 generalist family physicians, 1 pain management-focused family physician, 1 anesthesiologist, 1 physical therapist, 1 pharmacist, 1 nurse practitioner, and 1 psychologist), a patient representative, and a nonvoting pharmacist and guideline methodologist comprised the Guideline Committee. Member selection was based on profession, practice setting, and lack of financial conflicts of interest. The guideline process was iterative in identification of key questions, evidence review, and development of guideline recommendations. Three systematic reviews, including a total of 285 randomized controlled trials, were completed. Randomized controlled trials were included only if they reported a responder analysis (eg, how many patients achieved a 30% or greater reduction in pain). The committee directed an Evidence Team (composed of evidence experts) to address an additional 11 complementary questions. Key recommendations were derived through committee consensus. The guideline and shared decision-making tools underwent extensive review by clinicians and patients before publication. RECOMMENDATIONS Physical activity is recommended as the foundation for managing osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain; evidence of benefit is unclear for neuropathic pain. Cognitive-behavioural therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction are also suggested as options for managing chronic pain. Treatments for which there is clear, unclear, or no benefit are outlined for each condition. Treatments for which harms likely outweigh benefits for all or most conditions studied include opioids and cannabinoids. CONCLUSION This guideline for the management of chronic pain, including osteoarthritis, low back pain, and neuropathic pain, highlights best available evidence including both benefits and harms for a number of treatment interventions. A strong recommendation for exercise as the primary treatment for chronic osteoarthritic and low back pain is made based on demonstrated long-term evidence of benefit. This information is intended to assist with, not dictate, shared decision making with patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1406,35292814,"Service Users' Views and Experiences of Alcohol Relapse Prevention Treatment and Adherence: New Role for Pharmacists? AIMS To understand service users' views and experiences of alcohol relapse prevention medication, views of a telephone behavioural modification intervention delivered by pharmacists and the use of Contingency Management (CM) to support acamprosate adherence following assisted alcohol withdrawal. METHODS Four focus groups were conducted within four alcohol treatment and recovery groups across England (UK), with service users with lived experience of alcohol dependence (26 participants). Semi-structured topic guide was used to explore participants' views and experiences of alcohol relapse prevention medication, a telephone behavioural modification medication intervention delivered by pharmacists, and the use of CM to support acamprosate adherence. These were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed inductively and deductively. RESULTS Four themes were identified: concerns about support and availability of alcohol relapse prevention medication; lack of knowledge and understanding about acamprosate treatment; positive perceptions of acamprosate adherence telephone support from pharmacists; and negative perceptions of CM to support acamprosate adherence. There were misunderstandings about acamprosate's mode of action and strong negative beliefs about CM. However, most were positive about pharmacists' new role to support acamprosate adherence. CONCLUSION This study highlighted challenges service users face to commence alcohol relapse prevention medication. It appears service users could benefit from a pharmacist-led telephone intervention to improve understanding about acamprosate medication, particularly, if delivered in an engaging and motivating way.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1407,35293076,"Cross-sector pre-registration trainee pharmacist placements in general practice across England: A qualitative study exploring the views of pre-registration trainees and education supervisors.  The Pharmacy Integration Fund commissioned 95 cross-sector pre-registration trainee pharmacist placements across England, which incorporated trainees spending 3-6 months in general practice (GP), whilst employed in hospital or community pharmacy. Delivery models varied (blocks or split weeks/days); trainees had pharmacist tutors at the employing/base (hospital/community pharmacy) organisation and in GP. This study aimed to evaluate implementation of cross-sector pre-registration placements, and to identify barriers and enablers of a ""successful"" placement that achieved its intended outcomes. A qualitative study was undertaken, using semi-structured interviews with triads/dyads of trainee and pharmacist tutors at base and/or GP site. Interviews explored trainees' and tutors' GP placement experiences, and the contribution of GP placements to achieving intended learning outcomes. Data were thematically analysed. Thirty-four interviews (14 trainees, 11 base tutors, 9 GP tutors) were completed in 11 study sites (5 GP/hospital; 6 GP/community pharmacy). GP placements were perceived as valuable and producing well-rounded pre-registration trainees with a good understanding of two settings. Key benefits of GP placements were trainees' ability to work within multidisciplinary teams, and improved clinical and consultation skills. Contingency planning/flexibility was important when setting up cross-sector placements. GP tutor supervision which supported a gradual transition from shadowing to more independent clinical practice with feedback was perceived as valuable. Good collaboration between tutors at the base and GP site ensured joined-up learning across settings. All participants considered 13 weeks in GP an appropriate minimum duration; community trainees preferred longer duration (26 weeks) for more opportunities for clinical and consultation skills learning. Base and GP tutors would welcome clarity on which pre-registration competencies should be achieved in GP placements, which would also aid quality and consistency across providers. Findings from this study identified key attributes of a successful pre-registration cross-sector training experience. These findings can inform policy reforms including changes to initial education and training of pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1408,35294010,"Patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical care services for chronic diseases and their medication adherence during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES During the ongoing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, chronic disease management and medication adherence have become challenging; thus, health-related quality of life may have been compromised. As highly trusted healthcare providers, pharmacies in Saudi Arabia have undergone restructuring or redesign to cope with the current demands during the pandemic. The study assessed satisfaction levels of patients with chronic diseases concerning pharmaceutical care services provided during COVID-19 in addition to medication adherence and quality of life during the pandemic. METHODS An online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was administered. Saudi residents suffering from chronic diseases and receiving pharmaceutical care from a hospital or community pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic were eligible. The survey was created using Google Forms and distributed through online channels. The survey targeted 385 participants. KEY FINDINGS A sample of 317 patients was included. More than half had missed a follow-up visit for their chronic conditions since the beginning of the pandemic. The overall mean score ± standard deviation for the satisfaction level with pharmaceutical care services was 22.0 ± 10.3 on a scale of 0-36 with different satisfaction levels for different services. In addition to a good level of medication adherence, a high percentage of these patients reported no problem in most of the dimensions of the EQ-5D scale. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists should take a more proactive and consultive role to deliver healthcare needs of patients with a chronic condition and be aware of patient expectations from a pharmacist in situations, such as the current pandemic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1410,35294017,"Patients' knowledge, attitudes and concerns regarding the disposal of expired/unused medication. OBJECTIVES Unused/expired medicines that are improperly disposed of can enter soil and water supply and have negative implications for public health. This study aimed to assess patients' knowledge and understanding of medication disposal practices and their willingness to participate in a medication takeback programme. METHODS A self-administered questionnaire comprising of 26 questions based on demographics, knowledge, beliefs, practices and concerns was utilized in this study. The study was conducted over 12 weeks at outpatient pharmacy sites located in the four Regional Health Authorities in Trinidad. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 was used for statistical analysis. KEY FINDINGS A total of 547 persons completed the questionnaire. Knowledge of the dangers of improper medication disposal was highest in those aged 18-25 years (P = 0.007) and having secondary/tertiary level education (P = 0.002). Disposal of unused/expired medication via household thrash (86.1%) was the most commonly encountered practice. Only 14.1% (n = 77) of respondents asked the pharmacist for advice on best disposal practice, although 47.3% (n = 259) thought that the pharmacist should be the main source of advice for information on medication disposal practices. There was a willingness to participate in a medicine takeback programme from 82% (n = 449) of the respondents, and the majority (67.5%) (n = 303) would prefer it if medication takeback programmes were implemented at private community pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS Patients in Trinidad utilized household garbage as their main disposal method. There is a need to implement a medication takeback programme and educate the public on proper medication disposal.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1411,35294449,"Stability of extemporaneously prepared sitagliptin phosphate solution.  Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that is used orally in conjunction with diet and exercise to control sugar levels in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. This study aimed to extemporaneously prepare SiP solution (1% w/v) using pure Sitagliptin phosphate (SiP) powder and assess its stability according to pharmaceutical regulatory guidelines. Four SiP solutions, coded T1, T2, T3, and T4, were extemporaneously prepared using pure SiP powder as a source of API. The most suitable one, in terms of general organoleptic properties, was selected for further investigations, including stability studies. For this last purpose, samples of the T4 solution were kept under two storage conditions, room temperature (25˚C and 60% Relative Humidity) and accelerated stability conditions (40˚C and 75% Relative Humidity). Assay, pH, organoleptic properties, related substances, and microbial contamination were evaluated for 4 consecutive weeks. A High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analytical method was developed and validated to be used for the analysis and quantification of SiP in selected solution formulation. The adopted formula had a pH on the average of 3 to 4. During the stability tests, all pH values remained constant. Furthermore, after 4 weeks of storage under both conditions, the SiP concentration was close to 100%. A stable SiP extemporaneous solution was successfully prepared using pure SiP powder. Patients with swallowing problems who use feeding tubes and are unable to take oral solid dosage forms may benefit from this research.

1412,35295325,"The Impact of a Multifaceted Pharmacist-Led Antimicrobial Stewardship Program on Antibiotic Use: Evidence From a Quasi-Experimental Study in the Department of Vascular and Interventional Radiology in a Chinese Tertiary Hospital.  Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the impact of multifaceted clinical pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program on the rational use of antibiotics for patients who receive vascular and interventional radiology therapies. Methods: A quasi-experimental retrospective intervention design with a comparison group was applied to the practice of antibiotic use in the department of vascular and interventional radiology in a Chinese tertiary hospital. We used difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to compare outcomes before and after the AMS intervention between the intervention group and control group, to determine whether intervention would lead to changes in irrationality of antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic utilization, cost of antibiotics, and length of hospital stay. Results: The DID results showed that the intervention group was associated with a reduction in the average consumption of antibiotics (p = 0.017) and cost of antibiotics (p = 0.006) and cost per defined daily dose (DDD) (p = 0.000). There were no significant differences in the mean change of total costs and length of stay between the two groups (p > 0.05). The average inappropriate score of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis in the intervention group declined by 0.23, while it decreased by 0.02 in the control group [0.21 (95% CI, -0.271 to -0.143); p = 0.000]. The average inappropriate score of non-surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis in the intervention group declined by 0.14, while it increased by 0.02 in the control group [0.16 (95% CI, -0.288 to -0.035); p = 0.010]. The average inappropriate score of the therapeutic use of antibiotics in the intervention group declined by 0.07, while it decreased by 0.01 in the control group [0.06 (95% CI, -0.115 to -0.022); p = 0.003]. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that implementation of AMS interventions was associated with a marked reduction of antibiotic use, cost of antibiotics, and irrationality of antibiotic prescribing in China.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
1413,35296179,"Management of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs). PURPOSE To provide up to date guidance, practice recommendations and highlight barriers to medication adherence in the long-term management of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). AIM Current drug therapy for MPN is not curative and has not been shown to prolong survival. The main indication for treatment is the prevention of thrombosis and medication adherence remains a challenge in this group of patients. Identifying potentially modifiable barriers to medication adherence including primary nonadherence and non-persistent adherence enables timely interventions to be put in place and improve overall medication adherence. METHODS A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and expert opinions was performed using electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) that were searched for articles reporting MPN and medication adherence. Discussions A case vignette is discussed throughout the article and expert opinion with international peer reviewed guidelines that are authored to support clinical decision making at the point of care were utilised. The evidence base was combined with more practical/clinical (data based) insight from real world clinical practice. Adoption of a broad range of digital health care activities and services in the health care system (telehealth applications) by the advanced practice providers (Non-Medical Prescribers-NMPs) in MPN clinics included medication prescribing and management, oral drug compliance and adherence evaluations, interventions, chronic care management, counselling and patient education on treatments. CONCLUSION Current drug therapy for MPN is neither curative nor has it been shown to prolong survival, and medication adherence remains a challenge in this group of patients. The longevity of the patients' disease course may contribute to the high risk of non-adherence in this patient cohort. Poor adherence to long-term therapies severely compromises the effectiveness of treatment. Adherence interventions should be tailored to the needs of the patient in order to achieve maximum impact. Interventions aimed at improving adherence provide the best experience and outcome for the patient and their families and can have a profound impact on the quality of life and mitigation of disease consequences.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Improper and unsafe disposal of expired and unwanted medicines could cause harm to both people and the environment and therefore it is of public health importance. The objective of the study was to determine the methods employed by community pharmacist and their clients in the disposal of unwanted and expired medicines. Furthermore, the role of the pharmacists in the assessment of clients left over medicines was also explored. A cross sectional study design was employed with a sample of 120 pharmacy staff and 200 clients. Semi structured questionnaires were developed and administered to the two groups. Ethical approval was obtained. Data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v.24). Two hundred and eighty medicines were assessed from 131 respondents (65.5%) who brought their unused or left-over medicines to the pharmacy. These included analgesics 102(36.4%), antibiotics 50 (17.9%) and antacids 22 (7.9%). Disposal of expired and left-over medicines cited by respondents were the general-purpose bin 58(77.0%) and down the sink 11(14.3%). The majority 99(82.9%) of community pharmacies also disposed of solid dosage forms through the general-purpose bin. In addition, 90(75%) community pharmacies disposed of liquid waste in general purpose bin. Lack of enforcement of legislation was cited by community pharmacy staff as a barrier to the proper disposal of pharmaceutical waste. The predominant method of disposal of expired/unwanted medicines by community pharmacies and their clients was via the general-purpose bin.

1415,35296307,"Efficacy of a pharmacist-managed diabetes clinic in high-risk diabetes patients, a randomized controlled trial - ""Pharm-MD"" : Impact of clinical pharmacists in diabetes care. BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus affects 13% of American adults. To address the complex care requirements necessary to avoid diabetes-related morbidity, the American Diabetes Association recommends utilization of multidisciplinary teams. Research shows pharmacists have a positive impact on multiple clinical diabetic outcomes. METHODS Open-label randomized controlled trial with 1:1 assignment that took place in a single institution resident-run outpatient medicine clinic. Patients 18-75 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus and most recent HbA1c ≥9% were randomized to standard of care (SOC) (continued with routine follow up with their primary provider) or to the SOC + pharmacist-managed diabetes clinic PMDC group (had an additional 6 visits with the pharmacist within 6 months from enrollment). Patients were followed for 12 months after enrollment. Data collected included HbA1c, lipid panel, statin use, blood pressure control, immunization status, and evidence of diabetic complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis were performed. RESULTS Forty-four patients were enrolled in the SOC + PMDC group and 42 patients in the SOC group. Average decrease in HbA1c for the intervention compared to the control group at 6 months was - 2.85% vs. -1.32%, (p = 0.0051). Additionally, the odds of achieving a goal HbA1c of ≤8% at 6 months was 3.15 (95% CI = 1.18, 8.42, p = 0.0222) in the intervention versus control group. There was no statistically significant difference in the remaining secondary outcomes measured. CONCLUSIONS Addition of pharmacist managed care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with significant improvements in HbA1c compared with standard of care alone.

BACKGROUND Understanding the perspective of health care professionals (HCPs) is significant to the implementation of deprescribing in older adults with limited life expectancy (LLE) but a tool to assess this is lacking. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to develop and validate a survey tool for assessing HCPs attitudes towards deprescribing (HATD) in older adults with LLE. METHODS An online survey was used to collect data to determine the psychometric properties of a 49-item questionnaire generated from literature review, expert opinion and pretesting. 108 HCPs (doctors, nurses and pharmacists) with experience or interest in palliative care or a member of a palliative care team/organisation completed the survey. RESULTS Principal component analysis of the participants' data resulted in a 23-item questionnaire structured in five factors, named HATD tool. The factors were related to concerns about deprescribing (7 items), perceived burden of medications on patients (7 items), organisational support for deprescribing (4 items), assurance to deprescribing (2 items) and perceived involvement of patients in medication management (3 items). The HATD tool had valid descriptive statistics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure: 0.708; Bartlett's test of sphericity: p < 0.001, determinant: 1.35E-5; variance explained: 60.4%; nonredundant residuals with absolute values > 0.05: 39%). The reliability statistics of all the factors were ≥0.750 for both Cronbach's alpha (α) and composite reliability (CR) except for the patient-involvement factor (α = 0.644 but CR = 0.787).

BACKGROUND Approximately two-thirds of patients discharged from an emergency department (ED) are prescribed at least one medication. Prescription clarification by outpatient pharmacies for ED patients can lead to delays for patients and added workload. OBJECTIVES This study aims to describe prescriptions requiring clarification prior to being dispensed by an outpatient pharmacy for patients recently discharged from an ED. METHODS This study was conducted at an urban, 61-bed academic ED. Prescription clarification forms were used to identify common causes for outpatient pharmacies to contact the ED to clarify prescriptions prior to dispensation. Clarification types were reviewed and classified. Descriptive statistics were used to present the classification types. RESULTS There were 1278 documented calls to the ED for prescription clarification that were classified as clarification of directions for use (611, 47.7%), insurance or affordability issues (182, 14.2%), dose (172, 13.4%), medication availability (126, 9.8%), lost or missing prescription (93, 7.3%), patient allergy or adverse event (62, 4.8%), duplication in therapy (17, 1.3%), and clarification of medication ordered (17, 1.3%). When grouped into provider, system, or patient-related issues, provider issues were noted to be most frequent clarifications (862 clarifications, 67.3%), followed by system issues (325 clarifications, 25.4%), and finally, patient-related issues (93 clarifications, 7.3%).

1418,35296458,"Pharmacy Student Perceptions and Knowledge of Online Pharmacy Use.  Objective Currently, there is no set of standards for integrating the dangers of online pharmacies into Doctor of Pharmacy (DoP) curricula. As a result, many pharmacists are unable to recognize the differences between a legal and illegal online pharmacy, or educate patients on the dangers of online pharmacies. The objective of this study was to assess gaps in student pharmacist knowledge, and the impact of adding education on online pharmacies in DoP programs.Methods A pre and post survey design was developed. Data was collected through an electronic questionnaire distributed to pharmacy students in their second professional year (P2) to evaluate student knowledge gaps at baseline and after their education on illegal online pharmacies.Results A total of 102 students responded to the pre-survey, with 93 (91%) consenting to participate. Out of 100 respondents to the post-survey, 84 (84%) students consented. Approximately 87% (81/93) indicated some awareness of prescription medications being purchased online. Most students (89%, 77/86) stated that they do not believe the University has provided adequate curriculum on illegal online pharmacies and counterfeit medications. After receiving education on the relevant topics, 64% (55/85) stated they now felt their education was adequate.Conclusion Although pharmacy students are aware of the existence of illegal online pharmacies, they were not aware of the significance of this patient safety issue, or how to accurately identify suspicious websites.

1419,35297507,"Pharmacy Switching in Response to Preferred Pharmacy Networks in Medicare Part D. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of preferred pharmacy networks - a tool that Medicare Part D plans have recently adopted to steer patients to lower-cost pharmacies - on the use of preferred pharmacies and factors underlying beneficiaries' decisions of whether to switch to preferred pharmacies. DATA SOURCES Medicare claims data for a nationally representative 20 percent sample of beneficiaries during 2010-2016, merged with annual Part D pharmacy network files. STUDY DESIGN We examined preferred networks' impact on pharmacy choice by estimating a difference-in-differences model comparing preferred pharmacies' claim share pre- and post-implementation among unsubsidized and subsidized beneficiaries. Additionally, we evaluated factors affecting whether a beneficiary switched from mainly using non-preferred to preferred pharmacies. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS We examined standalone drug plans that adopted a preferred network during 2011-2016. Our main sample included beneficiaries 65 years and older who stayed in their plan in both the first year of implementation and the year prior and whose cost-sharing subsidy status and ZIP code remained unchanged during the two-year period. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Unsubsidized Part D beneficiaries faced an average difference of $129 per year in out-of-pocket spending between using non-preferred and preferred pharmacies, while subsidized beneficiaries were insulated from these cost differences. The implementation of preferred networks resulted in a 3.7-pp (95% CI: 3.3, 4.2) increase in preferred pharmacies' claim share in the first year among the unsubsidized. Existing relationships with preferred pharmacies, the size of financial incentives, proximity to preferred pharmacies, and urban residence were positively associated with beneficiaries' decisions to switch to these pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS Preferred pharmacy networks caused a moderate shift on average towards preferred pharmacies among unsubsidized beneficiaries, although stronger financial incentives correlated with more switching. Researchers and policymakers should better understand plans' cost-sharing strategies and assess whether communities have equitable access to preferred pharmacies.

1420,35299697,"The Survey on Adolescents' Cognition, Attitude, and Behavior of Using Analgesics: Take Sichuan and Chongqing as an Example. Objectives To explore the current situation of knowledge, attitude, and behavior about the correct use of analgesics among adolescents in Western Sichuan and Chongqing and its related factors and to provide a reference for health promotion schools to promote correct medication education and relevant policy-making. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted among senior high school students in Sichuan and Chongqing by stratified random sampling. A total of 48 classes were surveyed and 2,280 valid questionnaires were obtained. Descriptive analysis, mean value comparison, and multiple regression analysis were conducted for the data using SPSS17.0 statistical analysis software. Results (1) It showed that 65.5% of the students used methods other than drugs to deal with pain, 52.9% of the students took analgesics prescribed by doctors, more than 60% of the students got information about pain treatment from medical professionals or their families members, 71.6% of the students read the use label when using drugs, and only about 20% of the students knew the dosage and side effects of analgesics. (2) The higher the grade, the higher the proportion of students who often take analgesics prescribed by doctors, the higher the proportion of students who use methods other than drugs to relieve pain, the higher the proportion of students who read the label of analgesics, and the more information sources are introduced by family members. The better the knowledge, attitude, efficacy, and accomplishment of using analgesics, the better the behavior of using analgesics correctly. (3) Students who had taken analgesics provided by their family or friends and who had taken anti-inflammatory analgesics did not perform well in the correct use of analgesics. Conclusion The key factors that influence the correct drug use behavior of middle school students are their correct drug use literacy, efficacy, attitude, and reading of analgesics. Therefore, schools should strengthen cooperation with pharmacists and encourage the promotion of parent-child education activities of correct drug use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1424,35300022,"Development of a clinician guide for electronic medication adherence products in older adults. Background/objectives The ability to manage medications independently may be affected in older adults due to physical and cognitive limitations. Numerous electronic medication adherence products (eMAPs) are available to aid medication management. Unfortunately, there are no available guidelines to support clinicians in recommending eMAPs. The objective of this study was to create and validate a clinician tool to guide use of eMAPs. Methods Pharmacists who previously tested the usability of the eMAPs participated in a focus group to provide feedback on 5 metrics of the clinician guide: unassisted task completion, efficiency, usability, workload and an overall eMAP score. Participants were asked semistructured questions on how they would use the tool to inform recommendations of medication aids to patients. The discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. The clinician guide was modified to reflect feedback. Results Five pharmacists (80% female, mean years of practice: 15.8) participated in the focus group. The clinician guide was modified by removing 2 metrics and adding an additional 8 metrics: maximum number of alarms, number of days the product can accommodate for based on a daily dosing regimen, price, monthly subscription, portability, locking feature, average time to set the device and number of steps required to set the device. The definition and calculation for unassisted task completion were modified. Additional instructions and specific patient case examples were also included in the final clinician guide. Conclusion Since significant variability exists between eMAPs, it is imperative to have a tool for frontline clinicians to use when appropriately recommending the use of these products for medication management in older adults.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1428,35300357,"Feasibility of a Randomized Controlled Mixed Methods Trial to Address Health Literacy, Beliefs, Medication Adherence, and Self-Efficacy (ADHERE) in a Clinical Pharmacist-Led Clinic. Purpose To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a health literacy-psychosocial support intervention - ADHERE and explore changes in glycemic values and medication adherence. Patients and Methods Thirty-one participants with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 8% were randomly allocated to control (usual care) or intervention groups (receiving usual care plus a 6-session pharmacist-led intervention focusing on the modifiable psychosocial factors that may influence medication adherence). Feasibility metrics evaluated recruitment, retention, and intervention adherence. Questionnaires were administered to collect psychosocial factors and self-reported medication adherence at baseline, the end of the intervention, 3 months, and 6 months post intervention. HbA1c values were extracted from electronic medical records. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare differences in mean outcomes between the control and intervention groups. To assess intervention acceptability, eleven individuals participated in semi-structured interviews about their intervention experiences. Qualitative content analysis was used for analyzing the interviews. Results Thirty participants completed the study. Overall, the findings support the feasibility of the intervention. There were significant differences in HbA1c values. Participants in the intervention group had lower A1C (8.3 ± 1.4) than in the control group (9.2 ± 1.3) at the time of 6-month follow-up (p = 0.003). In addition, the participants in the intervention group showed improved HbA1c at 6-month follow-up (8.3 ± 1.4), compared to baseline (9.4 ± 1.5, p = 0.011) and after 6-session intervention (8.9 ± 1.6, p = 0.046). However, there were no significant differences in medication adherence between groups over time. Qualitative themes suggest participants liked the intervention and perceived the additional support from the pharmacist as beneficial. Conclusion A pharmacist-led intervention to provide additional health literacy-psychosocial support may contribute to long-term improvements in HbA1c. Equipping pharmacists with patient-specific diabetes medication adherence information and building in additional follow-up support for patients may improve patient health outcomes.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
1429,35300662,"Adaptation and validation of the patient assessment of chronic illness care in United States community pharmacies. BACKGROUND Roles for United States (US)-based community pharmacists in caring for persons with chronic conditions have greatly expanded. The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) was developed to assess patients' perspectives of care received. However, successful application of this instrument in community pharmacies is uncertain. The objective of this study was to adapt the PACIC for use in community pharmacies (CP-PACIC), assess validity of the CP-PACIC and examine CP-PACIC scale score differences relative to patient characteristics. METHODS This cross-sectional study surveyed chronically ill adults in Indiana, US who receive care from pharmacists in community pharmacies. The modified CP-PACIC scale consisted of 20-items, which were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (always). The total possible score ranged from 0 - 80. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to assess performance and dimensionality. CP-PACIC validity, including face validity, construct validity (via exploratory factor analysis) and internal consistency were assessed. Relationships between patient characteristics and scale scores were evaluated using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS Five hundred forty-six respondents' data were analyzed. EFA revealed a 2-factor solution (termed advanced pharmacy chronic illness care (AP) and traditional pharmacy chronic illness care (TP) subscales) accounting for 64.7% of variance; all 20 items were retained. The total 20-item CP-PACIC scale had a Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency) of 0.96; with a 12-item AP subscale Cronbach's alpha of 0.97 and 8-item TP subscale Cronbach's alpha of 0.89. Median total score was 12.0 [interquartile range = 27.3]. Median CP-PACIC sores varied across many respondent demographics (i.e., survey administration type, age, sex, education, health condition, number of pharmacy services received, community pharmacy type) such as whether respondents participated in one or more pharmacy service or not (29 vs. 10; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Unlike the original 5-subscale (patient activation, delivery system design, goal setting, problem solving, and follow-up/coordination) PACIC, analysis demonstrated a 2-factor (AP, TP) solution for the CP-PACIC scale with good internal consistency. As there are no standardized evaluation tools that exist, community pharmacies could find great value in using this CP-PACIC tool to benchmark performance and inform quality improvement strategies for patient care delivery.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1430,35300683,"A cross-sectional survey: knowledge, attitudes, and practices of self-medication in medical and pharmacy students. BACKGROUND Self-Medication is common practice worldwide in both developed and developing countries. Self-Medication is referred as self consumption of medication without consulting a physician for either diagnosis or treatment. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices toward self-medication among medical and pharmacy students. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted among medical and pharmacy students in Qassim university, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia, during the period 2020-2021. Multistage random sampling technique was used to recruit students. The data were collected through questionnaire. RESULTS Three hundred and sixteen of 316 students were recruited. This study showed that the majority (94.6%) of students had good knowledge of self-medication. Additionally, the following characteristics were significantly associated with good knowledge: being female, and Pharmacy students. Overall mean score for the attitudes towards self-medication shows that 58.4% of the total sample had high agreements towards the questions of the attitudes toward self-medication. More than half (63.9%) of the students reported that they practice self- medication in the last 6 months. Pain killers was the most common medication used for self- medication by the majority of the students (88.29%). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, students' knowledge of self-medication appears to be good and significantly high among pharmacy students in comparison to medical students. As well self-medication was highly practiced among the students. Therefor, medical and pharmacy students should be viewed as important contributors to the public health care system, and future health professionals should be properly educated on good pharmacy practice and responsible self-medication.

1431,35300730,"Feeling the burn in the era of COVID-19: cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Arabic version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory among community pharmacists. BACKGROUND Community pharmacists (CPs) are one of the frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) working diligently to provide much-needed services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout was one of the detrimental outcomes of the pandemic on the mental health of Lebanese CPs. To assess the extent of this syndrome among Lebanese CPs, a psychometrically reliable and valid tool is needed. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to validate the Arabic version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI-A) for use in the assessment of burnout among CPs. METHODS A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Lebanese CPs over February 2021. Data were collected using an anonymous Arabic self-administered questionnaire that includes information on socio-demographic characteristics, work-related variables, in addition to the measurements: the CBI which includes personal, work-related, and patient-related dimensions of burnout, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Amos software. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed to explore the factorial structure and to measure model fit. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency. The criterion validity of the CBI was assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between different aspects of burnout and mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety. RESULTS The CBI-A showed high internal consistency with Cronbach's alphas varied from 0.774 to 0.902 and a low floor and ceiling effect (1-9%). As for the CBI-A construct validity, the exploratory factor analysis showed three factors with good factor loadings and explained 72.17% of the variance. The confirmatory analysis supported the three-factorial structure of the CBI that presented a good overall fit based on the goodness-of-fit indices. Ad hoc modifications to the model were introduced based on the modification indices to achieve a satisfactory fit by allowing one covariate error between one pair of items within the personal burnout domain. All of the 19 items were kept in the construct since they showed a good factorial weight. The CBI-A is associated with burnout-related factors in expected directions, including extensive working hours, sleeping hours, and job satisfaction, indicating, therefore, the criterion validity of the tool. CBI subscales were also found positively associated with mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety demonstrating, in turn, a predictive validity. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence for the validity and reliability of the Arabic version of CBI as an adequate tool for assessing burnout among CPs. Such an instrument could be useful for assessing such syndrome among other healthcare workers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1432,35300810,"A machine learning model that emulates experts' decision making in vancomycin initial dose planning.  Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is a primary treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. To enhance its clinical effectiveness and prevent nephrotoxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of trough concentrations is recommended. Initial vancomycin dosing regimens are determined based on patient characteristics such as age, body weight, and renal function, and dosing strategies to achieve therapeutic concentration windows at initial TDM have been extensively studied. Although numerous dosing nomograms for specific populations have been developed, no comprehensive strategy exists for individually tailoring initial dosing regimens; therefore, decision making regarding initial dosing largely depends on each clinician's experience and expertise. In this study, we applied a machine-learning (ML) approach to integrate clinician knowledge into a predictive model for initial vancomycin dosing. A dataset of vancomycin initial dose plans defined by pharmacists experienced in vancomycin TDM (i.e., experts) was used to build the ML model. Although small training sets were used, we established a predictive model with a target attainment rate comparable to those of experts, another ML model, and commonly used vancomycin dosing software. Our strategy will help develop an expert-like predictive model that aids in decision making for initial vancomycin dosing, particularly in settings where dose planning consultations are unavailable.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1433,35301856,"Navigating the Complex Web of Prescribing Amyloidosis Therapeutics: A Primer.  Advancement in the diagnosis and treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy has made great strides in recent years. Novel therapeutics for transthyretin amyloidosis such as tafamidis, patisiran, and inotersen have shown significant benefits in a not-so-rare disease but come with high listing price tags ranging from a quarter to more than a half million dollars per year. These costs create significant financial barriers for the majority of patients, especially those with existing Medicare insurance plans. Of 72 patients reviewed, 67% were Medicare beneficiaries. Financial assistance was explored for the majority, and 37 (51%) patients with Medicare Part D received financial assistance that reduced their copayments to $0. Only one-third of our patients were able to afford these medications without any forms of financial assistance. Of these patients, 4 (6%) had the highest copayments ranging from $13 000 to $15 000 per year. To navigate the complexities of prescribing and affordability in amyloidosis, a multidisciplinary team including a dedicated clinical pharmacist is crucial in guaranteeing patients' success to secure these novel therapeutics. In this article, we discuss our experiences with prescribing, acquiring insurance authorizations, and financing these life-saving medications based on patient-specific insurance plans and socioeconomic status.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1434,35302652,"Modern developments in germline pharmacogenomics for oncology prescribing.  The integration of genomic data into personalized treatment planning has revolutionized oncology care. Despite this, patients with cancer remain vulnerable to high rates of adverse drug events and medication inefficacy, affecting prognosis and quality of life. Pharmacogenomics is a field seeking to identify germline genetic variants that contribute to an individual's unique drug response. Although there is widespread integration of genomic information in oncology, somatic platforms, rather than germline biomarkers, have dominated the attention of cancer providers. Patients with cancer potentially stand to benefit from improved integration of both somatic and germline genomic information, especially because the latter may complement treatment planning by informing toxicity risk for drugs with treatment-limiting tolerabilities and narrow therapeutic indices. Although certain germline pharmacogenes, such as TPMT, UGT1A1, and DPYD, have been recognized for decades, recent attention has illuminated modern potential dosing implications for a whole new set of anticancer agents, including targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, as well as the discovery of additional genetic variants and newly relevant pharmacogenes. Some of this information has risen to the level of directing clinical action, with US Food and Drug Administration label guidance and recommendations by international societies and governing bodies. This review is focused on key new pharmacogenomic evidence and oncology-specific dosing recommendations. Personalized oncology care through integrated pharmacogenomics represents a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between oncologists, laboratory science, bioinformatics, pharmacists, clinical pharmacologists, and genetic counselors, among others. The authors posit that expanded consideration of germline genetic information can further transform the safe and effective practice of oncology in 2022 and beyond.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1435,35303305,"Evaluation of a Residency Peer-to-Peer Intervention in Opioid Prescribing. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Family physicians play a crucial role in addressing the opioid epidemic. We studied a novel peer-review opioid prescribing educational intervention for family medicine residents that incorporates guided instruction from an interdisciplinary care team. METHODS We used a mixed-methods study design in the setting of a family medicine residency program in the Midwestern United States. Residents participated in small group, peer-to-peer discussions of patients chronically prescribed opioids with guidance and input from faculty, a pharmacist, and pharmacy students. Discussions followed a structured approach to evaluation based on guidelines, and written recommendations were given to the patients' resident primary care physician (PCP). For each patient, we reviewed electronic medical records to assess whether PCPs implemented the written recommendations. We used one-way analyses of variance to determine the statistical significance of changes made. The principal investigator interviewed seven participating residents to survey their satisfaction with the curriculum and collated suggestions for improvement. RESULTS Over a 3-year period, we reviewed 59 patients as part of the intervention; of these, 53 had complete records reviewed for this study. Patients' morphine milligram equivalent dosage (MME) declined modestly (P=.035). The number and proportion of recommendations implemented was correlated with the decline in MME (P=.004 and P=.013, respectively). Interviewed residents unanimously evaluated the curriculum positively, citing that the structured approach helped align their practices with guidelines. CONCLUSIONS The guided peer-review intervention effectively decreased chronic opioid use among patients, and residents positively evaluated the curriculum.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1436,35303814,"Psychiatry's role in the prevention of post-intensive care mental health impairment: stakeholder survey. BACKGROUND Many critical illness survivors experience new or worsening mental health impairments. Psychiatry consultation services can provide a critical role in identifying, addressing, and preventing mental health challenges during and after admission to the acute medical care setting. However, psychiatry involvement in the ICU setting is lower than in other hospital settings and the conventional process in many hospitals requires other care providers to request consultation by psychiatry. Despite these differences, no studies have sought ICU provider perspectives on psychiatry consultation's current and desired role. We aimed to obtain stakeholder feedback on psychiatry's current and desired roles in the ICU, and potential benefits and drawbacks of increasing psychiatry's presence. METHODS A web-based survey obtained perspectives from 373 critical care physicians and advance practice providers, bedside nurses, physical and occupational therapists, pharmacists, and consultation-liaison psychiatry physicians and advance practice providers at a tertiary care center using multiple choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive information and content analysis of qualitative data provided information on stakeholder perspectives. RESULTS Psychiatry's primary current role was seen as assistance with management of mental health issues (38%) and suicide risk assessments (23%). 46% wished for psychiatry's increased involvement in the ICU. Perceived benefits of increased psychiatry presence in the ICU included early psychological support in parallel with medical care, identification of psychiatric factors impacting treatment, and facilitation of family understanding of the patient's mental state/delirium. An additional perceived benefit included reduction in provider burnout through processing difficult situations and decreasing family psychological distress. However, one concern included potential conflict among providers regarding treatment. CONCLUSIONS Those who work closely with the critically ill patients think that increased psychological support in the ICU would be beneficial. By contrast, psychiatry's current involvement is seen to be limited, perhaps driven by varying perceptions of what psychiatry's role is or should be.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1437,35303864,"The influence of OSPE and PBL on competency-based pharmacy student self-assessment. BACKGROUND In addition to vocational education and experience, the pharmaceutical profession's proper pursuit requires acquiring and continuously improving professional competencies. In recent years, the need has been increasingly highlighted for developing a medical education system based on helping students develop their competencies. It is necessary to adapt the tools and methods for assessing competencies during formal education. It will enable students to know the directions of further personal or professional development. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to compare pharmacy students' self-assessment outcomes before and after the Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE), which finished the Pharmaceutical Care course (PCc). The study's purpose was also to compare the outcomes of the self-assessment of competencies between the students of two academic years for whom classes on the PCc were provided by different methods. METHODS The study was conducted over two academic years (2018/2019 and 2019/2020) among 5th-year students enrolled at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Jagiellonian University Medical College (JUMC) at the end of the Pharmaceutical Care course. Different teaching methods were used in the delivery of the course in these academic years. The students self-assessed their competencies using a questionnaire consisting of a list of personal and patient care competencies. The students completed the questionnaire before and after the OSPE, which followed the completion of the PCc. RESULTS Students' professional competencies as self-assessed after the exam were higher than those assessed before the exam. Differences were observed in both personal and patient care competencies. Students taking the course in the 2019/2020 academic year set their pre-OSPE competencies higher than students taking the PCc in 2018/2019. CONCLUSION The self-assessment scores increased for most competencies included in the study following the OSPE. This may suggest that taking part in the exam, involvement in patient's case simulations, and self-assessment of performance at individual stages of the exam contributed to increased subjective assessment of professional competencies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1438,35304228,"Development of Entrustable Professional Activities for Specialist Hospice and Palliative Care Pharmacists. CONTEXT Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) translate competencies into explicit, practical terms that clearly state the expected roles and responsibilities of clinicians who have achieved proficiency and expertise in a field. EPAs are defined for Hospice and Palliative Medicine physicians but not for other members of Hospice and Palliative Care (HAPC) interprofessional teams, including pharmacists. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to develop EPAs for HAPC pharmacists. METHODS An eleven-member workgroup of HAPC pharmacists was convened to develop candidate EPAs using nominal group and modified-Delphi methods. Content validity index was used as a measure of consensus, defined a priori at ≥ 60%. Vetting occurred via intra- and interprofessional stakeholder reactor groups and a national survey of HAPC pharmacists. RESULTS Following an iterative process of workgroup and stakeholder consensus-building, 15 HAPC pharmacist EPAs were developed. Among the workgroup, all 15 EPAs reached ≥ 70% consensus, indicating appropriate internal validity. In a national survey of 185 HAPC pharmacists with a 20% response rate, 13 EPAs were rated by most respondents as ""essential"" and 2 were rated by most respondents as ""important but not essential."" Respondents indicated the 15 EPA set represented the core professional activities of HAPC pharmacists well (median rating of 5 on a Likert-like scale, IQR 1). CONCLUSION Fifteen consensus EPAs describe essential activities of HAPC pharmacists in direct patient care, leadership, education, and scholarship. These EPAs will further guide pharmacist training programs, HAPC services seeking to incorporate a specialized pharmacist on the team, and currently practicing HAPC pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1439,35304413,"An Evaluation of Non-Academic Predictors of Success in a Doctor of Pharmacy Program.  Objective. Pharmacy programs have struggled to predict who will be successful in their programs based solely on cognitive skills. The primary objective of this study was to determine which, if any, non-academic factors are associated with on-time progression within the school of pharmacy (SOP) curriculum.Methods. A survey was developed and offered to all Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Jerry H. Hodge SOP students in Fall 2020. This survey included questions to collect demographic data and incorporated four validated questionnaires which included the (1) Grit-Grid, (2) Academic Pharmacy Resilience Scale (APRS-16), (3) Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and (4) Turkish Time Management Questionnaire (TTMQ).Results. Completed surveys were submitted by 213 students out of 569 (37.4% response rate). On-time progression rate was calculated separately for each class. Through binary logistic regression, pre-pharmacy grade point average >3.20, high school `Grit-Grid score >0.9, APRS-16 score >35, and CPSS >34 were significantly associated with on-time progression. PCAT composite scores and admissions committee rubric scores were not associated with on-time progression.Conclusion. Based on the results of this study, it may be reasonable to implement the Grit-Grid, APRS-16 and the CPSS in the admissions process to help determine the most appropriate candidates for our program or use them as screening tools for incoming students to identify who may be at academic risk. However, these factors need to be validated in pharmacy programs in other private and public universities before widespread adoption can be condoned.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Through carrier screening couples at-risk of conceiving a child with an autosomal recessive or X-linked condition can be identified prior to conception. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes and preferences regarding reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS) among reproductive-aged men and women in Flanders (Belgium). Women and men of reproductive age visiting their pharmacist were invited to answer a self-administered questionnaire. Prior to filling in the questionnaire, participants were asked to read an information leaflet explaining some key concepts about RGCS. Our sample included 387 individuals of reproductive age, of which 68.5% were female and 31.5% were male. Most of the participants were below 34 years old (72.9%), didn't have children (68.6%) and were currently in a relationship (69.1%). Offering RGCS to couples that want to have children was found acceptable by 86% of participants. However, fewer participants would consider RGCS for themselves in the future (61%). We observed a positive correlation between attitude score/knowledge score and the intention to have RGCS. Half of the participants (50.9%) preferred the disclosure of individual test results. Most of participants indicated that RGCS should be offered through the gynecologist (81.1%), followed by the GP (71.5%) and the Centre for Human Genetics (64.8%). About 68.9% of participants were willing to pay out-of-pocket for an RGCS test. We recommend that RGCS should ideally be implemented through a tailored implementation strategy whereby individual needs and preferences can be taken into account.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1441,35305609,"Understanding barriers to and strategies for medication adherence in COPD: a qualitative study. BACKGROUND Medication adherence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is low, though not enough is known about the factors that affect adherence in COPD. This study uses qualitative methods to understand the patient perspective on facilitators and barriers to medication adherence in COPD as well as patient-reported strategies for self-management of disease. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals (n = 30). Transcripts were analyzed using iterative qualitative coding by 2 independent coders, and codes were categorized using thematic analysis. RESULTS Challenges with adherence reported were gaps in understanding, forgetfulness of the patient, physician availability, cost navigation, and overcoming substance use. Most commonly, the financial burden of COPD medications caused patients to source other countries to obtain medications, rely on sample medications collected during doctors' visits, and to alter medication dosage and frequency to extend the length of a prescription. Tools and resources reported by patients to support self-management of COPD included pharmacist assistance, physician office information, and community resources. Individuals further reported that the use of logs or diaries to track medication usage, visual or temporal cues to take medications, and support from family members were helpful in promoting adherence to their COPD medication regimen. CONCLUSIONS Medication adherence in individuals with COPD is affected by challenges with self-management of disease and financial burden of medications. However, patients reported multiple tools and resources to support adherence. Physician recognition of these factors impacting self-management, as well as awareness of strategies to promote adherence and manage disease, may improve patient outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1442,35305926,"Perceptions, current practices, and interventions of community pharmacists regarding antimicrobial stewardship: A qualitative study. BACKGROUND Community health care accounts for the vast majority of antibiotic use in Europe. Given the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions in primary care that could involve different health care providers, including community pharmacists. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to explore the perceptions, currents practices, and interventions of community pharmacists regarding AMS. METHODS Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with community pharmacists in France. Participants were recruited through a professional organization of community pharmacists combined with a snowballing technique. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used while developing the interview guide and carrying out thematic analysis. RESULTS Sixteen community pharmacists participated. All the respondents had good awareness about antimicrobial resistance and believed that community pharmacists had an important role in tackling AMR. Some barriers to community pharmacists' participation in AMS were identified such as difficult interactions with prescribers, lack of time, and lack of access to patient medical records and diagnosis. Increased patient education, audits and feedback of antibiotic prescribing, increased point-of-care testing, and delayed prescribing were interventions suggested by the pharmacists to improve antibiotic use in primary care. Strategies cited by participants to facilitate the implementation of such interventions are increased pharmacist-general practitioner collaboration, specialized training, clinical decision support tools, and financial incentives. CONCLUSION This study suggests that community pharmacists could play a greater role in infection management and AMS interventions. Further interprofessional collaboration is needed to optimize antibiotic prescribing and utilization in community health care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmitter departs an energetic role in brain signalling system. Levels of GABA in the brain influence human behaviour, diminishes in the degree of GABA can cause seizures, depression, Parkinson's. To put it plainly, it plays a basic part in the significant issues of mind. It is exceptionally important to cure the issues linked to GABA. Writing overview proposed that nipecotic acid is an intense GABA reuptake inhibitor. This scaffold is likewise present in one of the promoted anticonvulsant drugs 'Tiagabine'. Tiagabine is only drug in the market which works through this mechanism however the medication is regulated with one more prescription for the synergistic impact. Nipecotic acid has several disadvantages such as it can't cross the blood-brain barrier because of its hydrophilic and zwitterionic nature. To avoid this problem nipecotic acid scaffold hybrids with the different aromatic groups can enhance the physical (lipophilicity) as well as biological properties of the resultant compound. So, there is a dire requirement for compounds that work through this mechanism. Several medicinal chemists and researchers are already working in this field and developed outstanding newer molecules. This review article compiles these developed new hybrids along with design strategies, structure-activity relationship, and biological activity as well as in silico studies. This review also demonstrates the synthesis of nipecotic acid and the core mechanism through which nipecotic acid acts as a GABA reuptake inhibitor.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1444,35306683,"Implementation of a pharmacist-led transitional pharmaceutical care programme: Process evaluation of Medication Actions to Reduce hospital admissions through a collaboration between Community and Hospital pharmacists (MARCH). WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE The recently conducted Medication Actions to Reduce hospital admissions through a collaboration between Community and Hospital pharmacists (MARCH) transitional care programme, which aimed to test the effectiveness of a transitional care programme on the occurrence of ADEs post-discharge, did not show a significant effect. To clarify whether this non-significant effect was due to poor implementation or due to ineffectiveness of the intervention as such, a process evaluation was conducted. The aim of the study was to gain more insight into the implementation fidelity of MARCH. METHODS A mixed methods design and the modified Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity was used. For evaluation, the implementation fidelity and moderating factors of four key MARCH intervention components (teach-back, the pharmaceutical discharge letter, the post-discharge home-visit and the transitional medication review) were assessed. Quantitative data were collected during and after the intervention. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with MARCH healthcare professionals (community pharmacists, clinical pharmacists, pharmacy assistants and pharmaceutical consultants) and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Not all key intervention components were implemented as intended. Teach-back was not always performed. Moreover, 63% of the pharmaceutical discharge letters, 35% of the post-discharge home-visits and 44% of the transitional medication reviews were not conducted within their planned time frames. Training sessions, structured manuals and protocols with detailed descriptions facilitated implementation. Intervention complexity, time constraints and the multidisciplinary coordination were identified as barriers for the implementation. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Overall, the implementation fidelity was considered to be moderate. Not all key intervention components were carried out as planned. Therefore, the non-significant results of the MARCH programme on ADEs may at least partly be explained by poor implementation of the programme. To successfully implement transitional care programmes, healthcare professionals require full integration of these programmes in the standard work-flow including IT improvements as well as compensation for the time investment.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1446,35307082,"Medicinal chemistry: The key to critical thinking in pharmacotherapy. INTRODUCTION Medicinal chemistry is a polarizing subject for pharmacy students where, if not embraced, future pharmacists may be limited in their role as drug experts. An understanding of medicinal chemistry and its structure-activity relationships creates a strong foundation upon which our knowledge of pharmacotherapy is built. PERSPECTIVE As the field of pharmacy has shifted to an increasingly clinical role, with an emphasis on patient care as a member of the interprofessional team, pharmacy has also seen an increase in postgraduate training, specifically residencies and fellowships. Pharmacy students noting this trend may depreciate medicinal chemistry early in the curriculum and place more focus on therapeutics and clinical rotations. However, forgoing the fundamental understanding of medicinal chemistry may hinder pharmacy students' current breadth and understanding, and the ability to rationalize future developments in their practice. Medicinal chemistry empowers pharmacists with the ability to reason through medications' impact versus simply memorizing their actions. Pharmacists play a unique role as drug experts, with advanced problem-solving and critical thinking skills that set them apart from drug references and search engines. IMPLICATIONS As the field moves towards pharmacists as a member of the clinical team, the faculty should integrate medicinal chemistry throughout the doctor of pharmacy curricula. Faculty without this ability for a curriculum change should consider integration in their content. The field of pharmacy must take care to not allow clinical knowledge to significantly overshadow the importance of medicinal chemistry or run the risk of saturating the field with underprepared pharmacists.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the current emphasis on geriatrics in doctor of pharmacy curricula. METHODS A 61-item web-based survey was distributed to associate deans with oversight of pharmacy curricula at all United States (US) schools and colleges of pharmacy (S/COP). Information collected included school demographics, employment of geriatrics faculty, geriatric education (required, elective, and experiential courses), co-curricular geriatric experiences, postgraduate residency training in geriatrics, student interest in geriatrics, and perception of preparedness of the profession to care for older adults. RESULTS Of responding S/COP, 35% required a course in geriatrics while 63% offered a geriatrics elective. An advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) in geriatrics was required by 14%, and 79% offered an elective APPE. Insufficient curricular emphasis on geriatrics was noted by 44% of responding schools, and 33% lacked confidence that the profession of pharmacy is adequately prepared to care for the aging population. CONCLUSIONS According to the survey respondents, most pharmacy schools do not have a required didactic course or APPE in geriatrics. Additional emphasis on foundational principles of medication management for older adults in pharmacy curricula is warranted to meet the health care needs of the rapidly aging US population.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1448,35307084,"Implementation and analysis of a LGBTQ cultural competency module on pharmacy student knowledge. INTRODUCTION This study describes the implementation and assessment of a cultural competency module on caring for patients who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ). The module was delivered to first professional year pharmacy students, and focused on student knowledge and application of LGBTQ-specific definitions, inclusive language, and health disparities. METHODS A mixed-methods design captured data to assess the effect of a LGBTQ module on student knowledge and confidence. For the pre- and post-assessment, descriptive statistics were calculated and mean differences were compared using the paired sample t-test. The number of correct choices for multiple-select questions were compared using the Pearson chi-square test. Post-laboratory (lab) reflections were analyzed via percentages of agreement for Likert-scale questions and thematic analysis of free-response questions. RESULTS Average pre- and post-assessment scores (n = 74 students) were 47.84% and 53.51% (P = .02). Sub-analysis of the multiple-select questions indicated statistically significant improvement in student performance on health disparities and culturally-competent communication (P values < .05). Likert-scale questions from 71 student's post-lab reflections indicated agreement of improved knowledge of health disparities (95.77%) and LGBTQ terminology (92.96%). Agreement in student's confidence using inclusive language and competent communication improved from 64.79% pre- to 95.67% post-module. Reflection themes included respect, inclusivity, awareness, and avoiding assumptions. CONCLUSIONS The module slightly improved student knowledge via assessment performance; however, student-reported knowledge and confidence regarding LGBTQ competency significantly improved. This module can be utilized by schools of pharmacy as a model educational activity on LGBTQ cultural competency with lab-based application.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1449,35307085,"Nailed it! Doctor of pharmacy learners' self-awareness of performance on authentic assessments. INTRODUCTION The primary objective of this pilot study was to determine the reliability and validity of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) self-awareness survey. A secondary objective was to assess learner self-awareness in OSCE performance. METHODS A retrospective review of OSCE data from a single cohort in a three-year accelerated doctor of pharmacy program occurred. The cohort completed four OSCEs with a total of 23 discrete cases. At the end of each case, before receiving feedback, learners completed an evaluation of their skills, communication, overall performance, and identified if they believed the patient/provider would return (""nailed or failed""). These self-evaluations were then compared with respective learner performance scores for each case. Content validity was assessed for the self-awareness survey via the Lawshe method. Reliability of the OSCE cases and self-awareness survey were conducted utilizing Cronbach's alpha and the Spearman-Brown formula, respectively. RESULTS The OSCE self-awareness survey was found to be face valid and reliable for the overall survey. The subsections of return to pharmacist and overall learner performance were also found to be valid and reliable. A statistical relationship was found between learner self-assessment of pass/fail and their actual grade for overall performance and return to pharmacist. CONCLUSIONS Results from this study may guide remediation plans related to OSCE performance and development of other self-awareness activities in practice settings. Further studies are needed to evaluate the broader application and use of self-awareness tools.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1450,35307086,"""They wanted to know what it was like through my eyes"": Patients and carers views, experiences, and perceptions of active involvement in the delivery of an undergraduate pharmacy curriculum. INTRODUCTION There is an increasing policy and practice imperative for involving patients and carers in health-related undergraduate courses. The School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences at Robert Gordon's University, United Kingdom launched a module where patients and carers are actively involved in the delivery of the curriculum by sharing their experiences of their condition and its management with final year student pharmacists. This study aimed to evaluate this initiative by exploring patients' and carers' views and experiences of their active involvement in the delivery and their perceptions of potential future involvement in the design of the pharmacy curriculum. METHODS Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were carried out with patients and carers who were actively involved in the delivery of the pharmacy course. The interview schedule was developed based on the research aim, an extensive literature review, and peer discussion before it was piloted. All interviews were digitally recorded and thematically analysed by two independent researchers. RESULTS Seven of eight patients and carers involved in the module agreed to be interviewed. Five themes were identified: reasons for engagement with active teaching, perceived impact of active teaching on students, perceived impact of active teaching on patients and carers themselves, perceived opportunity to improve care of future patients, and challenges and suggestions for improvement. CONCLUSIONS Overall, patients and carers had a positive view of their active involvement with delivering the undergraduate pharmacy curriculum; they were however unsure about involvement in curriculum design.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1451,35307088,"Assessing student pharmacists' ability to recognize and categorize interventions during an introductory pharmacy practice experience. INTRODUCTION Introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPEs) prepare students for advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) by reinforcing patient care skills learned in the didactic curriculum. Current literature does not assess pharmacy students' abilities to accurately recognize and categorize interventions in IPPEs or APPEs. This study evaluated the impact of incorporating paper-based simulated encounters and video answer keys to train students to accurately recognize and categorize interventions during an IPPE. METHODS During longitudinal IPPEs, first-, second-, and third-year students reviewed four patient case scenarios that mimicked authentic patient encounters. Students were tasked with recognizing and categorizing interventions and were provided answer key videos after each assignment. Total scores for the proportion of correct and incorrect intervention options selected were calculated and compared over time. Students and faculty mentors completed post-study questionnaires designed to assess perceived improvement in students' capability to recognize and categorize interventions. RESULTS A series of repeated measures analyses of variance were statistically significant (P < .05) for total scores and proportion of correctly selected and incorrectly selected intervention options. Students' accuracy to correctly recognize and categorize interventions improved by 8% over four case scenarios. The proportion of correctly selected interventions increased by 65%, and the proportion of incorrectly selected intervention options decreased by 49% based on mean percent scores. CONCLUSIONS Patient case scenario assignments and video recorded answer keys were useful tools to teach students how to document interventions. Exposure to documenting interventions during IPPEs helps prepare students for documenting interventions during APPEs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1452,35307089,"Pharmacy student self-assessment of strength of residency candidacy compared to clinical faculty. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to compare student and faculty perceptions of strength of residency candidacy and to identify student preferences and perceptions that influence the process of being selected by a residency program beyond standard application materials. METHODS A 31-item questionnaire was administered to third-year and fourth-year pharmacy students to collect information regarding factors deemed important for successful residency program candidacy. Global assessment of strength of residency candidacy was self-rated by students and a group of clinical faculty blinded to student responses. Interrater reliability for student-to-faculty and faculty-to-faculty perceptions of strength of residency candidacy was determined. RESULTS Students generally reported good academic metrics and participation in a wide variety of scholarly activities deemed important in attaining a residency position. Students rated overall strength of residency candidacy as ""above average"" (n = 54, 37.2%), ""average"" (n = 60, 41.4%), and ""below average"" (n = 31, 21.3%), and self-perception increased with matriculation. Student self-assessment of strength of residency candidacy compared to faculty assessment showed poor agreement (mean [SD] kappa = 0.27 [0.08]). Faculty concordance in assessment of strength of residency candidacy was moderate (α = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS Concordance in self-assessment of strength of residency candidacy of students compared to faculty was poor. In contrast, agreement among faculty was moderate with generally lower ratings compared to student self-rating, suggesting that students are overconfident in this regard. These findings support residency preparedness training in pharmacy curricula which should include formal assessment of strength of residency candidacy to identify gaps.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1453,35307090,"Expanding naloxone education in the doctor of pharmacy curriculum. INTRODUCTION Pharmacists are well-positioned to provide patients with access to the opioid-induced breathing emergency reversal agent naloxone, but many do not feel they have received adequate training to do so. The purpose of this project was to develop, implement, and evaluate an enhanced teaching approach to naloxone education in the doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) curriculum. METHODS The educational intervention incorporated active learning, technology, and interprofessional education components. Surveys were developed and administered pre-intervention and at one-week, six-month, and one-year post-intervention to evaluate changes in knowledge, perceptions, and confidence in clinical skills related to opioid-induced breathing emergencies and naloxone. RESULTS After participating, students' confidence (rated 0 to 5) in their ability to administer both intranasal (2.54 vs. 4.37, P < .001) and intramuscular (IM) (2.8 vs. 4.02, P < .001) naloxone increased, which was reflected in their improved performance on an opioid-induced breathing emergency simulation activity. Students ≤25 years old and females experienced significantly greater increases in their confidence to administer IM naloxone than those >25 years old and male. Most of these effects persisted at six months and one-year post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS The educational intervention increased pharmacy students' skills and confidence related to opioid-induced breathing emergency and naloxone. Improvements observed were in line with results of similar pedagogical studies. Age and gender differences in self-reported confidence levels also reflected previously reported findings. Materials and methods have been made available for other PharmD programs to utilize in expanding their curricula in these areas.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION The University of California San Francisco School of Pharmacy faculty created the Master Preceptor Program (MPP) to instill best practices in clinical precepting, leadership and professional development, and interprofessional education (IPE). Graduates of the program are encouraged to mentor colleagues at affiliated sites. This study aimed to explore MPP participants' perceptions about the program and to collect general feedback. METHODS A descriptive qualitative study of MPP participants who completed the program between 2017 and 2019 was conducted. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to collect general programmatic feedback and examples of skill implementation. All encounters were conducted and recorded online via Zoom. Three investigators independently analyzed transcripts for codes related to key programmatic areas using conventional content analysis. RESULTS Ten of 14 past MPP participants participated. Themes included confidence and skills gained in clinical teaching, self-reflection and network opportunities supporting professional and leadership development, and a need for structured expectations and deliverables. Participants noted several benefits of the MPP on clinical teaching, such as improving confidence and adopting teaching techniques, structural and organizational skills, and a learner-centered approach. Participants also mentioned programmatic offerings that improved leadership and professional development, such as networking opportunities in the MPP and at conferences. Participants did not mention IPE in their responses. CONCLUSIONS All participants recognized the MPP as an effective training program to enhance clinical precepting skills, leadership, and professional development.

1455,35307094,"Pharmacy students' perceptions on the health and pharmaceutical care needs of older adults. INTRODUCTION Perceptions of pharmacy students as future health care providers can enhance the health and pharmaceutical care (PC) needs of older adults. The objective of this study was to investigate pharmacy students' awareness and perceptions of the health and PC needs of older adults. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted among pharmacy students in Southwest, Nigeria for four weeks using a 39-item structured questionnaire. Unpaired t-tests and one-way analysis of variance were performed. A P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS Based on 422 completed questionnaires, 299 (70.9%) were females, 283 (67.1%) were 20 to 24 years, 123 (29.2%) were in 200 Level, 402 (95.3%) had heard of PC with their first source of information being pharmacy school, 352 (83.4%). Reliability of the instrument was 0.92 (Cronbach's alpha). Mean + SD of pharmacy students' perceived health and PC needs of older adults were 3.73 ± 1.176 and 4.21 ± 1.031, respectively. The majority, 355 (84.2%), agreed on the importance of health care providers understanding their geriatric patients' family circumstances and social environment and 381 (90.3%) perceived that such will strengthen their professional relationship with older adults. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy students were aware of PC and indicated positive attitudes towards caring for older adults but few had provided care.

1456,35307095,"Evaluation of a poverty-focused educational program and simulation for pharmacists. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Limited literature explores the impact that poverty-focused educational simulations can have on practicing clinicians. This study used a poverty simulation, specifically created to resemble the lives of Medicare patients, to sensitize practicing pharmacists to the situations faced by people living in poverty. The study evaluated how a poverty-focused educational program impacted practicing pharmacists' actual knowledge gain, intention to assist patients with limited income, and satisfaction with the educational program. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING A quasi-experimental one-group pre-/posttest design of practicing pharmacists was utilized. The intervention was a live continuing educational (CE) program at a pharmacy alumni event and a pharmacy convention. The CE program was delivered in person and included a Medicare poverty simulation and a 75-min didactic lecture. Pre- and posttests were used to assess outcomes. The primary outcome was change in knowledge as measured by test scores. Secondary outcomes included intention to assist future low-income patients and participant satisfaction with the educational program. FINDINGS Eighty-nine pharmacists participated in the educational program. Participants' mean knowledge increased from 2.76 (SD = 0.97) to 3.61 (SD = 1.21) (P < .001) out of 5. The majority (88.3%) agreed they were interested in assisting patients with limited income in the future. Most participants strongly agreed that the program was satisfactory and contributed to their learning.

1457,35307096,"A scaffolded problem-based learning course for first-year pharmacy students. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE There has been an increased use of active learning pedagogies in pharmacy curricula. Structured, complex pedagogies such as problem-based learning (PBL) may require rigorous training for students to be successful. We aim to describe the development and implementation of an introductory PBL course for first-year pharmacy students. We describe the theoretical framework for course development, including the educational philosophies informing the course design. Development of PBL skills and professional behavior were evaluated using student self-assessment throughout the course. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING This introductory PBL course was developed using educational philosophies to scaffold student learning of the pedagogy and development of PBL skills. A student self-assessment was administered at two time points throughout the course. The self-assessment contained items related to PBL skills and professional behaviors. Self-assessment scores were compared with facilitator evaluations of student performance to determine reliability of self-assessment results. FINDINGS Eighty-eight students completed both self-assessments (93.6% response rate). Self-assessment of PBL skills increased significantly. There was no improvement in self-assessed professional behaviors. Self-assessment scores did not correlate with facilitator assessment of student performance in a small group. SUMMARY Integrating a scaffolded, theoretically sound educational approach to introduce students to the PBL pedagogy improves students' self-assessed PBL skills but not professional behavior.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE One of the most common daily tasks on Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) is ""working up"" patients for inpatient rounds or outpatient visits. The purpose of this study was to assess a change in student pharmacist comfort level in performing a patient workup before and after the Pre-APPE Workshop by specifically teaching this process. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING The patient workup process was included in the Pre-APPE Workshop, a one-week APPE orientation course at the end of the third professional year. Students completed a 34 question self-assessment prior to instruction and after completion of the course to assess their comfort level with working up patients and readiness for APPEs. Student perceptions were compared pre- and post-assessment. Additionally, performance on assignments and results from a voluntary course evaluation were assessed. FINDINGS One hundred and fifty-two (100%) students enrolled in the Pre-APPE Workshop completed the pre- and post- self-assessments. Differences in student comfort level were found between the pre- and post-course self-assessments (median, [interquartile range]) related to performing an inpatient workup (3 [2-3] versus 3 [3-3], median change 0 [range - 2, 3]), and the outpatient workup (3 [2-3] versus 3 [3-4], median change 1 [range - 2, 3]), Overall, students felt more prepared to start APPEs after the Pre-APPE Workshop (3 [2-3] versus 3 [3-4]).

1459,35307099,"Experiential education supervisors as assessors of pharmacy student injection technique. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students at the University of Waterloo in spring 2020 enrolled in the injections training curriculum were unable to complete the practical assessment component under the usual in-person model. Therefore, an alternative assessment strategy needed to be adopted to meet these curricular outcomes. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING To allow students to complete their training and apply this skill during co-operative work placements in fall 2020, pharmacist supervisors (preceptors) who were authorized to administer injections were asked to evaluate the practical assessment on behalf of the university. Students were mailed supplies to use for practice and assessment, and preceptors were provided the grading rubric and a copy of the didactic training materials for their reference. To obtain feedback on the process and identify areas for improvement, students and supervisors were invited to complete a brief survey containing both Likert scale and open-ended questions upon completion of the assessment. FINDINGS By fall 2020 term end, 69 of 121 students successfully completed the practical assessment component at a workplace. Survey responses indicated that, despite some challenges accommodating the assessment within a busy pharmacy's existing workflow and identifying volunteers to receive the injections, the modified assessment was well received. SUMMARY Supervisors can be effective adjuncts to in-class instruction and assessment of injection technique. Even when initial assessments can take place at the university, providing supervisors with access to training materials and rubrics can reinforce these skills for students immediately prior to their implementation into practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1461,35307309,"Framework to enable pharmacist access to health care data using Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. BACKGROUND Decentralization and authentication are embedded in blockchain technology, which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure seamless sharing of data among different health care providers while safeguarding data privacy. Although community pharmacists are highly accessible to patients and possess robust clinical knowledge, they are limited in the clinical services they can provide owing to their lack of access to patient health records. We proposed a blockchain- and AI-based conceptual framework by performing a scoping review of successful blockchain integration in health systems. OBJECTIVE To formulate a conceptual framework based on a scoping review to improve access to health care data in the community pharmacy setting through the adoption of blockchain technology and AI. METHODS We performed a scoping review of literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses review criteria to identify the specific areas where blockchain can be implemented in health systems. We utilized the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP) to identify 2 critical areas for blockchain integration that can support community pharmacists to access patient electronic health records and implement patient-specific information in clinical decision-making. RESULTS We included 7 articles out of 70 articles in our final review. The 2 areas in the PPCP identified for the use of blockchain on the basis of the literature review were ""Assess"" and ""Implement."" Our proposed model involves pharmacists using AI and blockchain technology to comprehensively assess any concerns with the prescribed medication through access to laboratory results for patients and then implement a plan based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's health record. CONCLUSIONS Utilizing blockchain to securely share health data with community pharmacies has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize medication safety, and amplify pharmacists' roles in patient care.

1462,35307310,"Twelve-month supply of short-acting contraception methods: Pharmacists' perspectives on implementation of new state law. BACKGROUND Oral contraceptives and other short-acting reversible contraceptive (SARC) methods such as the patch, vaginal ring, and medroxyprogesterone injections are used by approximately 30% of people using contraception. People may face barriers in obtaining a timely and adequate supply of their SARCs. It is well established that dispensing more than 1-month supply at a time is more convenient for patients, improves continuation, and decreases the risk of unintended pregnancy. Given the potential for public health impact, 20 states, including Massachusetts, have expanded access to a 12-month supply of SARCs. OBJECTIVES The goal of this qualitative study was to explore Massachusetts pharmacists' general awareness and specific knowledge of the state's 2017 Act Advancing Contraceptive Coverage and Economic Security in Our State (ACCESS) law, explore barriers to the implementation of the law, and elicit recommendations to improve uptake of this practice. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of community pharmacists in Massachusetts between September 2020 and May 2021 using a pretested interview guide. Interviews were audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Data collection ceased when theoretical saturation was achieved. Data were analyzed using modified grounded theory, including code book development and line-by-line and axial coding. RESULTS Sixteen pharmacists from diverse practice settings participated in the interviews. All the pharmacists (100%) reported that they had received no training on the ACCESS law, and only 1 pharmacist reported having complete knowledge of the specifics of the law. We identified key themes and subthemes related to pharmacists' concerns about implementation of the law at the system, pharmacy, and patient level, including insurance coverage, communication of new laws, stocking, supply, and misuse by patients. CONCLUSION Addressing the need for pharmacist training and communication regarding new regulations may improve provision of an extended supply of SARC methods.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1463,35307311,"Effects of pharmacist interventions on pain intensity: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. BACKGROUND Pharmacists can play an important role in pain management. OBJECTIVE(S) This review aims to summarize the effects of any type of pharmacist intervention, whether led by a pharmacist or in a supportive role, on pain intensity over time in individuals with pain of any etiology. METHODS Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched from inception to the end of May 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the effect of pharmacist interventions on pain intensity. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated study quality. The analyses used a random-effects models and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to rate the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcome was reduction in pain intensity and presented as standardized mean differences (SMD). RESULTS Twelve RCTs including 1710 participants were included. Pooled estimate of 12 studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity compared with control (SMD -0.22 [95% CI -0.31 to -0.12], I2 = 0%, low certainty). The intervention was more effective when a pharmacist delivered a combination of services comprising educational interventions, medication review, and pharmaceutical care services (SMD -0.24 [95% CI -0.35 to -0.13], I2 = 0%, moderate certainty). For educational interventions alone, no statistically significant difference was observed (SMD -0.15 [95% CI -0.45 to 0.15], I2 = 47.6%, low certainty). Pharmacist intervention was also effective in reducing pain intensity for patients with cancer-related pain (SMD -0.76 [95% CI -1.17 to -0.36], I2 = 0%, moderate certainty). CONCLUSION There is some promising evidence to suggest that multicomponent pharmacist interventions including medication review or any other pharmaceutical care services, rather than merely educational interventions, are beneficial in reducing pain intensity, particularly in patients with chronic pain. High-quality RCTs are required to confirm the clinical significance of this findings before advocating for its widespread implication in clinical practice.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,"Oncology, Palliative care",,,,Other,
1464,35307471,"Analysis of Blood Type for SARS-CoV-2 and Correlation for Disease Acquisition in Various Sociodemographic Groups Including Women of Childbearing Age. BACKGROUND Multiple studies have occurred to determine if a patient's blood type, Rhesus factor (Rh), and sociodemographic attributes contribute to contracting SARS-CoV-2. True association remains unknown. METHODS Inclusion criteria included in-patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with blood type assessed. Study endpoints combined ABO, Rh and all cause inpatient mortality (ACIM) with testing positivity. Pregnancy status was one of several secondary endpoints evaluated. A logistic regression analysis was used to estimate association. RESULTS Of the 27,662 patients who met inclusion criteria, Type A blood was associated with increased positivity [1.01 (1.0-1.21), p=0.03]. Type B [1.10 (0.99-1.23), p=0.08] and AB [0.98 (0.81-1.19), p =0.84] showed no association. When evaluating ACIM, type A [1.18 (0.91-1.52), p=0.22], B [1.13 (0.82- 1.56), p=0.480], and AB [1.06 (0.62-1.81), p=0.839] were not associated with increased mortality. The female subgroup was less likely to test positive [0.88 (0.82-0.986), p=0.002]. Black patients demonstrated a higher likelihood of positivity when compared to White [1.96 (1.79-2.14), p<0.001]. Non-pregnant women exhibited a 2.5 times greater likelihood of testing positive [2.49 (2.04-3.04), p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms results of previous research which showed SARS-Co-V-2 positivity related to blood type. It also confirms more recent research demonstrating inequities related to acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 for certain sociodemographic groups. Larger studies are warranted to confirm and further explore novel pregnancy findings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1465,35308574,"The response to COVID-19 among drug retail outlets in Indonesia: A cross-sectional survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Background Pharmacists have been at the frontline of the COVID-19 response in Indonesia, providing medicines, advice, and referral services often in areas with limited healthcare access. This study aimed to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and practices during the pandemic, so that we can be better prepared for future emergencies. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Indonesia was conducted between July and August 2020. The dataset was analysed descriptively, and logistic regression was used to explore willingness to participate in COVID-19 interventions. Findings 4716 respondents participated in the survey. Two-thirds (66·7%) reported knowing only ""a little"" about COVID-19 and around a quarter (26·6%) said they had not received any COVID-19 guidelines. Almost all were concerned about being infected (97·2%) and regularly took steps to protect themselves and their clients (87·2%). Stock-outs of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other products (32·3%) was the main reason for not taking any precautions. Around a third (37·7%) mentioned having dispensed antibiotics to clients suspected of having COVID-19. To support COVID-19 response efforts, most respondents were willing to provide verbal advice to clients (97·8%), distribute leaflets to clients (97·7%), and participate in surveillance activities (88·8%). Older respondents, those identifying as male, and those working in smaller outlets were more willing to provide information leaflets. Those working in smaller outlets were also more willing to engage in outbreak surveillance. Interpretation Drug retail outlets continue to operate at the frontline of disease outbreaks and pandemics around the world. These providers have an important role to play by helping to reduce the burden on facilities and providing advice and treatment. To fulfil this role, drug retail outlets require regular access to accurate guidelines and steady supplies of PPE. Calls for drug retail outlet staff to plat in response efforts including the provision of information to clients and surveillance could ease escalating pressures on the health system during future outbreaks.

Results The overall knowledge was better among nurses (64.56%), followed by pharmacists (54.5%). 81.65% of PHPs were willing to learn more and expressed the need for collaboration with dentists. In the past 3 months, 18.81% of them had PC patients with dental/oral health issues, but only 3.5% of nurses and 0.8% of pharmacists treated them. The logistic regression model revealed higher scores in mucositis/mucosal pain (OR = 1.41), altered taste sensation (OR = 1.34), sensitive gums (OR = 1.71), and dental caries (OR = 1.32) domains (p < 0.05). Those who had readiness to learn (OR = 5.37), nurses and pharmacists, and having less years of experience (OR = 1.31) and higher degree (OR = 1.4) had a positive attitude (p < 0.05). Conclusion PHPs had limited empowerment in terms of knowledge and practice but showed a positive attitude toward the prevention and management of dental/oral health issues of PC patients. For better practice, continuing education and collaboration with dental professionals is essential.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1468,35310300,"Experiences to date with the logistical management of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine.  The logistical management of an injectable therapy for the treatment of HIV can be expensive, time consuming, frustrating and riddled with barriers. In this Commentary, we describe our experiences to date with acquiring, storing, handling, administering and billing for long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine through four scenarios, each of which have presented their own unique obstacles and learning curves. At the time of writing, we have successfully transitioned four patients from the CUSTOMIZE trial to long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine. In doing so, we encountered a variety of barriers to acquiring, handling and administering the medication for both insured and uninsured patients; it is expensive, on a limited number of insurance formularies, and often requires a prior authorization from the provider. Cold-chain handling of the injectable therapy, along with individual patient characteristics, present barriers to management and administration of this therapy. Whilst a seemingly very attractive option for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine present a variety of challenges to pharmacists, providers and clinic staff on how to obtain it for and administer it to the patient. We plan to continue documenting our experiences, progress and successes, or lack thereof, in order to fine-tune our process and share with others.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1469,35310405,"A mixed-methods needs assessment to identify pharmacology education objectives for emergency medicine residents. Objectives Medication errors represent a significant threat to patient safety. Pharmacotherapy is one of the 23 Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education milestones for emergency medicine, yet there is minimal understanding of what content should be prioritized during training. The study aim was to develop objectives for a patient-safety focused pharmacology curriculum for emergency medicine residents. Methods We incorporated data from a de-identified safety event database and survey responses of 30 faculty and clinical pharmacists at a single-site suburban university hospital with 24-hour emergency medicine pharmacists and an annual volume of approximately 70,000. We reviewed the database to quantify types and severity of medication errors over a 5-year period for a total of 370 errors. Anonymous surveys included categorical items that we analyzed with descriptive statistics and short answer questions that underwent thematic analysis by 2 coders. We summarized all data sources to identify curriculum gaps. Results Common medication errors reported in our database were wrong dose (43%) and computer order entry errors (14%). Knowledge gaps were medication cost (63%), pregnancy risk information (60%), antibiotic stewardship (53%), interactions (47%), and side effects (47%). Qualitative analysis revealed the need to optimize computer order entry, understand the scope of critical medications, use references, and consult pharmacists. Integration of data suggested specific medications should be covered in curricular efforts, including antibiotics, analgesics, sedatives, and insulin. Conclusion We developed objectives of pharmacology topics to prioritize during emergency medicine training to enhance prescribing safety. This study is limited due to its small sample and single institution source of data. Future studies should investigate the impact of pharmacology curriculum on minimizing clinical errors.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Worldwide, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, there was an increase in the tendency of misusing prescription drugs as well as self-medicating with over-the-counters. Additionally, an increase in the use of herbs and natural products was reported. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted in Jordan from May 19th to July 29th, 2021, to assess the medications and natural products used in Jordan during the second wave of the pandemic. The survey was developed and validated, then distributed using Google Forms via social media platforms. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences-24. The study participants (n=386) had a mean age of 29.35 (SD=11.90) years. Most of participants were females (72.8%), not married (64.5%), non-smoker (69.2%), have a Jordanian nationality (80.6%), hold a bachelor's degree (73.1%), and living in the middle of Jordan (74.1%). More than 70% of the participants used vitamin C, D and pain relievers. The most used natural products were citrus fruits (78.8%), honey (63.0%) and ginger (53.1%). The participants reported that family and friends (55.4%) played a major role in advising them to use medications and dietary supplements. Pharmacists ranked second (54.1%), followed by social media platforms (43.3%). Multiple logistic regression analysis highlighted that only the age significantly affected the participants' use of medications and natural products (P<0.001). The results of this study warrant the need of conducting awareness campaigns guided by trained healthcare providers to educate people and minimize the risk of side effects that may arise from unsupervised use of medications and natural products.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1471,35311397,"""Still on the Fence:"" A Mixed Methods Investigation of COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence Among Health Care Providers. BACKGROUND There is evidence of disparities in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among health care providers. The purpose of this study was to examine confidence receiving and recommending COVID-19 vaccines by health care provider type and race/ethnicity. METHODS This mixed methods study involved a cross-sectional survey and qualitative, semi-structured interviews from March to May 2021 among a sample of physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and pharmacists. These workers were recruited through voluntary response sampling from an integrated health system in Southern California. The primary dependent variables were (a) confidence in vaccine safety, (b) confidence in vaccine effectiveness, and (c) intent to recommend the vaccine to others. The primary independent variables were health care provider type and race/ethnicity. FINDINGS A total of 2,948 providers completed the survey. Nurses relative to physicians were 15% less likely to perceive the COVID-19 vaccine to be safe (risk ratio [RR] = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83-0.87); 27% less likely to perceive the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 (RR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.69-0.76); and 11% less likely to recommend the vaccine to others (RR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.87-0.91). Hispanic/Latinx providers were 10% less likely to perceive the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 (RR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.83-0.98) relative to White providers. Qualitative themes included: No need for vaccine; distrusting vaccine research and roll-out; caretaking barriers; uncertainty and potential to change one's mind; framing vaccine decisions around personal beliefs.

1472,35311594,"The Effect of Patient Opioid Education on Opioid Use, Storage, and Disposal Patterns.  We evaluated the impact of patient education over opioid use, storage, and disposal on opioid handling patterns of palliative and chronic nonmalignant pain patients. We compared patient surveys before and after education and conducted further analysis for individual clinics due to group differences found prior to education. A total of 100 patients were included. After education, more patients reported never sharing their prescription opioid (95% vs. 66%; P < 0.01), and all reported awareness that one dose could be harmful to someone else (100% vs. 31%; P < 0.01). In addition, more patients reported locking their opioid for storage (85% vs. 13%; P < 0.01). Lastly, less patients reported leftover opioids (2% vs. 40%; P < 0.01), not always disposing (1% vs. 44%; P < 0.01), or purposefully saving (0% vs. 15%; P < 0.01), and all reported knowing the right way to dispose (100% vs. 14%; P < 0.01). Proper methods of disposal increased, including mixing with unpalatable substances (96% vs. 13%; P < 0.01) and utilizing drug-take-back programs (78% vs. 24%; P < 0.01).

1473,35313632,"The Practice of the Community Pharmacists in Managing Potential Drug-Drug Interactions: A Simulated Patient Visits. Background Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can cause treatment failure and serious adverse drug reactions, leading to morbidity and mortality. Due to their significant effects on the patient's health, community pharmacists (CPs) competence in detecting and preventing these interactions is essential to provide optimal health services. Thus, this study aimed to explore the performance of the CPs in situations involving the presence of potential DDIs. Methods A cross-sectional, simulated patient study was conducted in 235 community pharmacies in the Khartoum locality. Two scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of the CPs. Ten final year B. Pharm. students were selected to act as simulated patients (SPs); they were trained for two weeks to familiarize their roles. All encounters were documented immediately after leaving the pharmacy by the SPs in the data collection form. Results All planned SPs visits were completed, resulting in 470 visits. None of the CPs asked about the patients' medication history in both scenarios. After the SPs provided information about the drug used currently by the patient, 13.6% and 23.4% of the CPs had identified the potential DDIs in scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively. In scenario 1, 59.4% distinguished the interaction of simvastatin with both drugs, while, in scenario 2, 74.5% recognized the interaction of warfarin with both drugs. In identifying DDIs, around half of the CPs were dependent on their knowledge or using drug interaction checker programs. The most common intervention made by the CPs was referring the patient to the prescriber (56.3% CPs in scenario 1 and 60% CPs in scenario 2). Conclusion CPs practice in identifying and managing potential DDIs was poor. The current CPs practices need substantial improvement. Therefore, professional education and the use of software programs in community pharmacies should be encouraged.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1474,35313880,"Exploration of changes in pharmacy students' perceptions of and attitudes towards professionalism: outcome of a community pharmacy experiential learning programme in Taiwan. BACKGROUND A powerful way to nurture and strengthen professionalism is by accruing practice-based experiences. However, few studies in Taiwan have evaluated the impacts of experiential learning programmes on pharmacy students' views on professionalism - the core of quality healthcare practices and services. This study aimed to measure changes in perceptions of and attitudes towards professionalism among third-year pharmacy students following an introductory-intermediate experiential learning course. METHODS A single-group pre- and postcourse comparative study using a self-administered survey was conducted in 2017. Pharmacy students in their third year of a six-year programme were eligible to participate in this study. We used a 28-item questionnaire with a 10-point Likert-type scale to assess students' professionalism. Among them, 10 items were employed to assess students' perceived importance of professionalism in pharmacy practice, and another 18 items adapted from the Pharmacy Professionalism Instrument were used to evaluate students' attitudes towards pharmacy professionalism. An independent t test was performed to compare the differences in students' anonymous survey responses before and after the course, with an a priori level of statistical significance of 0.05. RESULTS Fifty-two pharmacy students participated in the study. They showed significant improvement in three tenets of professionalism, namely, altruism (p = 0.035), accountability (p = 0.026), and duty (p = 0.002), after completing the 5-week experiential course. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy students' attitudes towards professionalism were modifiable by purposely designed experiential learning programme in the community setting.

1475,35314118,"The role of nonprescription syringe sales in ending the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic.  In 2019, the executive branch of the United States released ""Ending the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Epidemic: A Plan for America"" (EHE). EHE proposes to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030. To do so requires a multifaceted effort from all health care providers addressing every possible avenue of HIV transmission. An important aspect of this mission is to increase access to sterile syringes for people who inject drugs (PWID). For many PWID, access to Syringe Service Programs is limited because of hours, location, and state laws. Pharmacies are able to provide clean syringes in a safe, clean, climate-controlled atmosphere with access to a health professional. Although published research shows pharmacist ambivalence toward the nonprescription sales of syringes, pharmacist involvement in states with established guidance and support from departments of health suggests that pharmacists are interested in this public health effort. However, without proper support from departments of health and access to training on the dignified delivery of services, pharmacies will continue to be an ineffective avenue for prevention of HIV spread through the provision of sterile syringes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1476,35314119,"Impact of a hormonal contraceptive training program for pharmacists. BACKGROUND Several states have passed legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraceptives in an effort to expand access to family planning options for patients. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this research is to evaluate participant knowledge and perception, attitudes, and preparedness regarding pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception before and after completion of the American Pharmacists Association's interactive online training program, ""Increasing Access to Hormonal Contraceptive Products: A Training Program for Pharmacists."" METHODS Training program participants were assessed on their knowledge after each module, and they were invited to participate in a pre- and postsurvey about practice environments and opinions related to hormonal contraceptive prescribing. Descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical survey responses, and means and standard deviations were calculated for program knowledge assessment scores. Pre- and postsurvey responses were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or McNemar's test according to the type of response options. RESULTS More than 450 participants completed the Hormonal Contraception Training Program; 61% completed the presurvey and 39% completed the postsurvey. Participants had an average score of 86% across modules for both surveys. Comfort level increased statistically significantly in all areas surveyed after program completion. Survey results identified statistically significant changes between pre- and postsurvey in the belief that pharmacists are trained and educated to counsel on and initiate hormonal contraceptives (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) and that prescribing hormonal contraceptives should be within a pharmacist's scope of practice (P < 0.001). Most respondents (83%) agreed that pharmacy schools should expand content on contraceptive prescribing, although more than half (56%) reported that their pharmacy school taught them the requisite hormonal contraceptive clinical content. CONCLUSION Training programs play an important role in preparing pharmacists for prescribing roles by providing knowledge and increasing confidence and generally positively affecting perceptions of and attitudes toward prescribing hormonal contraceptives.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1477,35314424,"An Introductory Over-The-Counter Simulation For First-Year Pharmacy Students Using A Virtual Pharmacy.  Objective. First-year pharmacy students at two institutions were required to complete a virtual over-the-counter (OTC) simulation during their community pharmacy practice skills laboratory course. The simulation was designed to introduce first-year pharmacy students to OTC product selection and consultation prior to didactic coursework and community introductory pharmacy practice experiences. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the OTC simulation on students' knowledge and confidence of OTC medications and overall perceptions of the activity.Methods. Patient simulation cases set in the virtual community pharmacy setting were developed and delivered to students utilizing the MyDispense platform. Students concurrently completed a Google Form that provided directions for the virtual activity, including a combination of didactic and active learning strategies within the online platform. Student surveys assessed knowledge and confidence before and after the activity with perceptions added to the post-survey.Results. Total knowledge scores for the 142 students from 2 institutions who completed both the pre-and post-survey significantly improved and, when assessed individually, improved for seven out of 10 individual knowledge questions. All five confidence statements significantly increased after students completed the OTC simulation. Student perceptions were overall very positive, with significant variation only occurring for the statement of ""I learn better in this format rather than a classroom lecture.""Conclusion. Introduction of OTC counseling processes to first-year pharmacy students through a virtual pharmacy resulted in increased student knowledge and confidence in providing OTC recommendations.

Due to COVID-19 and the limitation of face-face teaching, electronic adaptation for formative and continuous assessment methods were greatly used and documented between 2020 and 2021. This study aims to implement a virtual escape room that will help assist and refine problem-solving skills in fifth-year pharmacy students by reviewing Beer's criteria and selecting the most appropriate management. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted following the implementation of the virtual escape room using google form. Students had to unlock five puzzles using Beer's criteria. To evaluate pharmacy students' perception of this method, they completed a survey to identify their views of the game. Of the 128 students enrolled in the geriatric course, all were able to escape (100%). A one-sample t-test indicated statistical significance between gender. Female students escaped statistically faster than male students (p &lt; 0.00002) and were more likely to recommend the game to other students and thought the game encouraged them to think of the material in a new way, whereas male students were more neutral towards it.

This study aimed to evaluate the current practice of community pharmacists from patients' and pharmacists' perspectives in Saudi Arabia. This paper presents the pharmacist's perspective. A cross-sectional self-administered online survey was designed to collect responses from community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia from February to April 2021. The questionnaire consisted of several statements related to best practice in community pharmacy. Pharmacists' responses to each statement were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores represented a greater extent to which they adhered to best practice in the community pharmacy setting and vice versa. Data of 164 participants were included in the analysis. The minimum median score was related to the statement: Pharmacist explains the main side effects. The maximum median score was related to the statement: Pharmacist explains dosage regimen. Pharmacists aged 30 years or above and non-Saudi pharmacists had significantly higher median scores compared with pharmacists less than 30 years of age (p = 0.016) and Saudi pharmacists, respectively (p = 0.001).

1481,35314621,"Introducing Audio Podcasts into a Practical Laboratory Course for Pharmacy Students as a Novel Tool for Performance Assessment.  The use of digital tools can positively impact higher education for both scholars and faculty. In recent years, it has become apparent that podcasts are a suitable medium for use in teaching. They are provided almost exclusively by lecturers for students, with students passively listening to them rather than actively participating in their production. However, this could also be valuable for students. Therefore, this pilot study investigated the extent to which the creation of a podcast would be accepted by students as a method for capturing pharmacy students' understanding of the learning content. The evaluation was performed as part of the ""Clinical Chemistry"" practical course, which was attended by third-year pharmacy students in groups of three. After passing the station dealing with practical clinical chemistry relevant diagnostic systems, the groups were asked to produce an educational podcast covering the essential content on the topics of urine test strips or pulse oximetry, respectively. Student attitudes toward the adoption of podcasts as a tool for performance assessment were determined with an anonymous and voluntary survey. The respondents reported that they had fun creating the podcast, which enabled them to look at the instructional content from a different perspective. Competencies such as social and communication skills and media literacy as well as self-organized and self-directed learning were also promoted. However, the students assumed that the tool is not ideally suited for dealing with extensive topics. Nonetheless, the students clearly support the continued creation of podcasts as a performance assessment tool. In addition, they suggest integrating podcasts into other courses within the pharmacy curriculum. This may also be related to the infrequent use of novel technologies, such as podcasts, in their education thus far.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent study found that only 23.8% of blood pressure (BP) devices available for purchase from Australian pharmacies were validated for accuracy. The extent to which pharmacists are aware of this, and other issues related to the accuracy of BP devices, is not known and gathering this information was the aim of this study. An online survey of Australian pharmacists was distributed via the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia between 1 October and 25 November 2020. Questions were focused on the views of pharmacists related to the accuracy of BP devices. Two hundred and ten pharmacists completed the survey. The accuracy of BP devices sold by pharmacists was considered 'quite' or 'extremely important' to most respondents (94%). However, most respondents (90%) were unaware that less than one-quarter of BP devices sold by Australian pharmacies were validated, and this was 'quite' or 'extremely surprising' to many (69%). Many respondents (64%) associated a particular brand of BP device with greater accuracy. There was low awareness on proper ways to identify accurate BP devices, such as checking reputable online databases (43%). BP devices were stocked in respondents' pharmacies based on perceived quality (50%), accuracy (40%), or as determined by the pharmacy chain (36%). In conclusion, providing accurate BP devices to consumers is important to pharmacists, but they were generally unaware that most devices available from pharmacies were not validated for accuracy.

Two-stage facilitated, structured, audio-recorded interviews were conducted at each of four CPs in London, England, between May and November 2019 [1 month in each CP]. Parents/carers or young persons (aged 16-18 years) who visited CP for a child-related matter were invited to participate. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, using thematic analysis to identify themes. In total, 249 (58.2% of 428 eligible) customers agreed to participate and completed the two interviews. Out of these, 82.3% (205/249) reported positive experiences with the CP. The general practitioner (GP) was the preferred healthcare provider for minor ailments (44.6%,111/249), while 35.7% (89/249) would choose CP. Eighty-two participants (33%) visited an Emergency Department in the last 12 months, with 13.4% (11/82) of them visited for cold and cough reasons. Where a child was present with parents/carer (128/249), there was a low level of interaction between children and pharmacists (13.3%, 17/128). Lack of awareness about the CP services provided for children and privacy were among the barriers identified by participants. Advertising of CP services and creating a child-friendly environment were recommendations suggested by participants. The findings of this paper show that CP remains an underutilised health service for children by parents/carers and young persons.

1484,35316690,"Risky alcohol use among patients dispensed opioid medications: A clinical community pharmacy study. BACKGROUND Included among the significant risk factors for opioid overdose is concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, particularly alcohol. Given the continued expansion of community pharmacy in the continuum of care, it is imperative to characterize alcohol use among pharmacy patients dispensed opioids in order to establish a foundation for identification and intervention in these settings. METHODS This secondary analysis utilized data from a one-time, cross-sectional health assessment conducted among patients dispensed opioid medications in 19 community pharmacies in Indiana and Ohio. Adult, English speaking, patients not receiving cancer care who were dispensed opioid medications were asked to self-report alcohol and substance use, behavioral and physical health, and demographic information. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were employed to characterize alcohol use/risky alcohol use and patient characteristics associated therewith. RESULTS The analytical sample included 1494 individuals. Participants were on average 49 years of age (Standard Deviation=14.9)-with 6% being persons of color (n = 89). Weekly drinking was reported by 18.1% (n = 204) and daily drinking was reported by 6.8% (n = 77) of the study sample, with a total of 143 (9.6%) participants reporting moderate/high risk drinking. Males (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=1.94, 95% CI=1.3,2.9), those with higher pain interference (AOR=1.44, 95% CI=1.0,2.0), overdose history (AOR=1.93, 95% CI=1.1,3.5), sedative use (AOR=2.11, 95% CI=1.3,3.5), and tobacco use (AOR=2.41, 95% CI=1.6,3.7) had increased likelihood of moderate/high risk alcohol use (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Medication labeling and clinical guidelines clearly indicate that patients should abstain from concomitant use of opioids and alcohol.

1485,35317473,"A case for implementation of adult pneumococcal vaccine program in Africa: review and expert opinion.  Vaccines are considered as a therapeutic area for children; the scientific community focuses mainly on managing chronic disease when it comes to adults. There currently is an increase in the burden of vaccine preventable illnesses in adults. Adult vaccination has been shown to dramatically increase the health and quality of life of older populations. Therefore, adult vaccinations need to be approached as a public health issue, similar to smoking cessation programs, for example. According to the Kenya Non-Communicable Diseases and injuries poverty commission report, 2018. Kenya has a high percentage of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) from communicable diseases at 63%, while non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contribute 30% of the DALYs. Specific to pneumococcal pneumonia (PP) in adults, the Global burden of disease (GBD) study in 2016 found that 2,377,697 people of all ages died from lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in 2016. Of these, more people died from Streptococcus pneumonia(SP) than from all other studied respiratory pathogens combined. While the incidence of LRTIs in children under five years old was reducing, partly as a result of well-established vaccination programs in children, the incidence, morbidity and mortality of PP was increasing in older populations. The expert recommendations included the following; i) all individuals 65 years of age and above, and individuals with a predisposing comorbidity regardless of age, should receive the pneumococcal vaccine; ii) several systemic modules can be emulated from the successful childhood vaccines programs onto an adult vaccine program; iii) formulation of an effective vaccine program will require collaboration from the public, the government, healthcare providers, and the media, to create awareness; iv) stakeholders who need to be involved in vaccine policy development and implementation include medical professional associations, nurses, pharmacists, clinical officers, payers (private and public insurances), government, medical learning institutions and faith-based medical organizations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION Pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing services have been delivered through community pharmacies across the globe, though not yet in the UK. This paper is reporting a focus group study, the first stage of a participatory co-design process to increase the chance of a successful implementation of a PGx service through community pharmacy in the UK. AIM To identify the barriers and enablers to implementing a community pharmacy based PGx service in the UK. METHOD Three focus groups were conducted with community pharmacists (n = 10), prescribers (n = 8) and patients (n = 8) in England. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using the Braun and Clarke six phase reflexive thematic analysis approach. RESULTS The analysis identified five themes about PGx testing in community pharmacies: (1) In- principle receptiveness, (2) Appreciation of the benefits, (3) Lack of implementation resources (4) Ambiguity about implications for implementation and (5) Interprofessional relationship challenges. CONCLUSION The identified enablers for implementation of a PGx service were at a macro health system strategic level; the concerns were more at a granular operational procedural level. Overall receptiveness was noted by all three participant groups, and both prescriber and pharmacist groups appreciated the potential benefits for patients and the healthcare system. Prior to implementation in the UK, there is a need to disambiguate health professional's concerns of the guidance, resources, and knowledge required to set up and deliver the service and to resolve patient concerns about the nature of genomics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

A dose-dependent increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma was observed in toxicology studies conducted in rats. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of osteosarcoma over a 10-year period among teriparatide-treated patients versus patients unexposed to teriparatide with osteoporosis and patients in the general population using national pharmacy dispensing data linked with data from participating state cancer registries (SCRs) in the US. METHODS Patients aged 18 years or older with a dispensed teriparatide prescription formed two different cohorts: Teriparatide-Osteoporosis (Teriparatide-OP) was formed by matching teriparatide patients to unexposed patients with osteoporosis and Teriparatide-General Population (Teriparatide-GP) was formed by matching teriparatide patients to general population patients with a dispensed prescription for a medication other than teriparatide. Matching was performed using select demographics and other variables. Study cohorts were linked to SCR data to ascertain osteosarcoma status. To account for missing outcome data from non-participating SCRs, two analytic approaches were used: the first adjusted the person-time at-risk using a coverage fraction and the second restricted the analyses to patients from states with participating SCRs. RESULTS There were 18 osteosarcoma cases across four study cohorts: the same three cases in the Teriparatide-OP and Teriparatide-GP cohorts, six cases in the Osteoporosis cohort, and nine cases in the General Population cohort. For the analysis using the coverage fraction the incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing the Teriparatide-OP and Teriparatide-GP cohorts to the Osteoporosis and General Population cohorts was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.2, 4.5) and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.2, 5.1), respectively. When restricting the analysis to patients from states with participating SCRs, the IRR was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.1, 3.6) and 0.8 (95% CI 0.1, 4.0), respectively. CONCLUSION The estimates of association between teriparatide and osteosarcoma were imprecise due to the small number of observed osteosarcoma cases. However, the incidence of osteosarcoma observed in each study cohort was within the expected range given background rates for the US general population. The evidence generated by this study, in conjunction with other real-world studies evaluating the risk of osteosarcoma, was used to support changes to the US teriparatide label (including removal of the black box warning regarding potential risk of osteosarcoma) and expand treatment options for patients with osteoporosis.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1488,35318713,"Increase of high-risk tramadol use and harmful consequences in France from 2013-2018: evidence from the triangulation of addictovigilance data. AIM To assess recent developments in non-medical tramadol use, tramadol use disorder, illegal procurement, and deaths. METHODS Repeated cross-sectional analysis of data collected nationwide from 2013-2018. Analysis through the multisource monitoring of the French Addictovigilance Network: 1) validated reports of high-risk tramadol use, 2) record systems collecting information from: toxicology experts investigating analgesic-related deaths (DTA) and deaths related to substance abuse (DRAMES), and pharmacists for forged prescriptions (OSIAP), and 3) survey in drug users, with investigation of patterns of use while visiting in addiction specialised structures (OPPIDUM). RESULTS Despite a plateauing level of tramadol exposure in the French population, the proportion of tramadol reports increased by 1.7 times (187 cases in 2018, 3.2% (95%CI: [2.74-3.63%]), versus 1.9% (95%CI: [1.49-2.42%] in 2013). Trends were similar in OSIAP (11.9% of forged prescriptions in 2018 (95%CI, [10.56-13.45%]); 1.7 times increase), in OPPIDUM (0.76% (95%CI, [0.55-1.02]); 2.2 times increase), and DRAMES (3.2% of drug abuse-related deaths in 2018 (95%CI, [1.89-5.16]) versus 1.7% in 2013 (95%CI, [0.65-3.84]). Tramadol was the first opioid in analgesic-related deaths in DTA (45% in 2018). Two profiles of high-risk tramadol users were identified: 1) patients treated for pain or with tramadol persistence when pain disappeared (mainly women; mean age 44 years), and 2) individuals with non-medical use for psychoactive effects (mainly men; mean age 36 years). CONCLUSION The triangulation of the data obtained through addictovigilance monitoring evidenced a recent increase of high-risk tramadol use. Those findings had a practical impact on the limitation of the maximal duration of tramadol prescription.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1489,35318920,"Decrease in Tuberculosis Cases during COVID-19 Pandemic as Reflected by Outpatient Pharmacy Data, United States, 2020.  We analyzed a pharmacy dataset to assess the 20% decline in tuberculosis (TB) cases reported to the US National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020 compared with the 2016-2019 average. We examined the correlation between TB medication dispensing data to TB case counts in NTSS and used a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model to predict expected 2020 counts. Trends in the TB medication data were correlated with trends in NTSS data during 2006-2019. There were fewer prescriptions and cases in 2020 than would be expected on the basis of previous trends. This decrease was particularly large during April-May 2020. These data are consistent with NTSS data, suggesting that underreporting is not occurring but not ruling out underdiagnosis or actual decline. Understanding the mechanisms behind the 2020 decline in reported TB cases will help TB programs better prepare for postpandemic cases.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1490,35320289,"Efficacy and safety of antimicrobial stewardship prospective audit and feedback in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: A protocol for a pragmatic clinical trial. BACKGROUND The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is widespread in patients with COVID-19 despite a low prevalence of bacterial co-infection, raising concerns for the accelerated development of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is vital but there are limited randomized clinical trial data supporting AMS interventions such as prospective audit and feedback (PAF). High quality data to demonstrate safety and efficacy of AMS PAF in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are needed. METHODS AND DESIGN This is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferiority, pragmatic randomized clinical trial evaluating AMS PAF intervention plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone. We include patients with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible ward beds and critical care unit beds will be randomized prior to study commencement at each participating site by computer-generated allocation sequence stratified by intensive care unit versus conventional ward in a 1:1 fashion. PAF intervention consists of real time review of antibacterial prescriptions and immediate written and verbal feedback to attending teams, performed by site-based AMS teams comprised of an AMS pharmacist and physician. The primary outcome is clinical status at post-admission day 15 measured using a 7-point ordinal scale. Patients will be followed for secondary outcomes out to 30 days. A total of 530 patients are needed to show a statistically significant non-inferiority, with 80% power and 2.5% one-sided alpha assuming standard deviation of 2 and the non-inferiority margin of 0.5. DISCUSSION This study protocol presents a pragmatic clinical trial design with small unit cluster randomization for AMS intervention in hospitalized COVID-19 that will provide high-level evidence and may be adopted in other clinical situations.

1491,35320485,"The standards of practice for delivery of polypharmacy and chronic disease medication reviews by general practice clinical pharmacists: a consensus study.  Background General practice in the UK is experiencing a crisis. Greater multidisciplinary working is a potential solution. The new general practice contract in Scotland encourages this and includes a new pharmacotherapy service to be delivered by General Practice Clinical Pharmacists (GPCPs). Consensus is lacking for the standards of practice for delivery of pharmacotherapy medication reviews (which are polypharmacy and chronic medication reviews) as part of this service. Aim To identify and validate standards of practice for polypharmacy and chronic disease medication (pharmacotherapy level 3) reviews conducted by GPCPs. Method A two-phased mixed-methods consensus methodology was used. Phase 1: An expert group of GPCPs (n = 4) and clinical pharmacist managers (n = 2) responsible for delivering the pharmacotherapy service used a Modified Nominal Group Technique to generate potential standards. Phase 2: Two-round Delphi survey involving GPCPs with ≥ 1 year of experience of working in general practice (n = 159). Results The expert group identified 44 potential standards of practice for polypharmacy and chronic disease reviews. Practicing GPCPs indicated during the Delphi phase that the 44 standards were applicable to practice. The standards of practice covered seven main categories: skills, environment, qualifications, qualities and behaviours, knowledge, process and experience. Conclusion Practicing GPCPs indicated that the standards identified by the expert group are acceptable and valid for current practice and the delivery of polypharmacy and chronic medication reviews. The application of these standards to practice may help GPCPs and general practices to ensure equitable delivery of patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1492,35321755,"Opportunities for extended community pharmacy services in United Arab Emirates: perception, practice, perceived barriers and willingness among community pharmacists. BACKGROUND Community pharmacies are widely distributed in the United Arab Emirates where community pharmacists' (CPs') perspectives on provision of extended community pharmacy services (ECPS) is not known. This study assessed CPs perception, practices, perceived barriers and willingness to provide ECPS. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional survey using a self-administered Likert-type questionnaire (Cronbach alpha = 0.976) was conducted among 195 community CPs in Northern emirates, selected through multistage sampling technique. The filled questionnaires were assessed for CPs' perception, practice, perceived barriers and willingness to perform ECPS. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests examined the association between demography and outcome variables (alpha value of 0.05) with further analysis using Dunn' post hoc test. RESULTS Of the respondents, 71.8% (n = 140) 'strongly agreed' that every CP must provide ECPs and 39% (n = 76) 'strongly agreed' in supporting ECPS with another 44.1% (n = 86) 'agreed' on the same. The major barriers felt by CPs in practicing ECPS were lack of incentive for employee pharmacists [3 (2-3)], lack of documentation [3 (2-3)], insufficient time [3 (2-3)] and lack of patients' demand [(2-3)]; maximum score (5-5). CPs also responded 'completely' willing to provide services such as blood pressure measurement, pregnancy testing and BMI measurement. Pharmacy location influenced practice score (p = 0.008) and access to the internet had a significant effect on barriers score (p = 0.000). Availability of drug information sources impacted perception (p = 0.038), practice (p = 0.000) and willingness scores (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS CPs' perception on providing ECPS was positive and they are currently offering ECPS within their available resources and facilities. Less demand from patients and lack of time were reportedly the major barriers in offering ECPS. Proper utilization of CPs in providing ECPS can complement the healthcare system with additional cost and time savings for the patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1493,35322454,"Qualitative exploration of the experiences of community pharmacists delivering the Diabetes MedsCheck service. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE The Diabetes MedsCheck (DMC) pharmacist service improves patient medication use and provides education on diabetes self-management. The original 2012 program evaluation identified barriers and facilitators in implementation. There are no recent studies exploring pharmacists' experiences with the DMC service. This pilot study may contribute to achieving an optimal diabetes management service in Australia. To explore the experiences of community pharmacists in providing the DMC service. METHODS A purposive sampling approach was used to recruit practising Australian community pharmacists from July to December 2019. Inclusion criteria included provision of DMC service for more than 1 year and having delivered the service within 3 months of recruitment. Semi-structured interviews elicited pharmacists' experience with the DMC service. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Twelve interviews of community pharmacist owners, managers and employees (including three who had additional medication review and diabetes qualifications), resulted in four primary themes: benefit of and need for training in diabetes management, challenges of service delivery and implementation, the challenge of patients' diabetes management and the positive effect of DMC on pharmacists' professional satisfaction from the positive impact on patient interactions and diabetes management. Pharmacists highlighted the need for continuous training on diabetes management and patient communication, and a dedicated time and space for service provision for optimal implementation and delivery of DMC. DMC helped to fulfil pharmacists' desires to provide health care. Pharmacists perceived through patient engagement and patient feedback that DMC benefits patient health care. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Positively, the implementation of the DMC service has promoted engagement with other health professionals while also contributing to pharmacists' professional satisfaction. Patient satisfaction and awareness of the health knowledge that pharmacists provide promotes pharmacist capabilities to the public. To ensure that accessible diabetes care in community pharmacy is optimized for greatest patient care, pharmacists delivering DMC should be supported by provision of contemporary diabetes management training and communication skills. Additional investment in community pharmacy operational set-up, such as dedicated pharmacist time, dedicated consulting space, upskilling of staff and investment in technology is also required to support optimal delivery of DMC.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1494,35323859,"Home infusion pharmacy quality improvement for central venous access devices using anti-reflux needleless connectors to reduce occlusions, emergency room visits, and alteplase costs. PURPOSE The study's purpose was to measure the impact of anti-reflux needleless connector usage in prevention of intraluminal thrombotic occlusions among central venous catheters, as represented by alteplase usage, in a home infusion patient population. METHODS An18-month before-and-after cohort study of a single home infusion intervention was conducted to compare occlusion outcomes with use of two types of needleless connectors-neutral and anti-reflux-in preventing catheter occlusions, which have been reported to occur in 28% of home infusion patients, resulting in treatment delays, increased nursing encounters and emergency room visits, and higher overall pharmacy costs for supplies and alteplase. RESULTS A total of 552,707 patient therapy days were studied: 42.5% in the neutral needleless connector group (n = 235,004 therapy days) and 57.5% in the anti-reflux needleless connector group (n = 317,703 therapy days). The rate of alteplase usage with neutral versus anti-reflux needleless connectors was 4.4% versus 2.2% per 1,000 therapy days, with median alteplase use of 112 (95% CI, 89-169) units versus 82 (95% CI, 68-109) units (P < 0.001). Implementation of anti-reflux connectors reduced occlusions and alteplase usage by 48%. CONCLUSION Statistical evidence demonstrated that use of anti-reflux needleless connectors with central venous access devices reduced the need for alteplase in the study population. Since 10% of patient occlusions were within 7 days after home infusion admission, future research may indicate that placement of anti-reflux needleless connectors at the time of in-hospital insertion can improve patient outcomes. This quality improvement measure reduced central catheter occlusions, alteplase costs, and the number of required nursing and emergency room visits.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1495,35324362,"Home-based treatment of biologics for asthma: who, what, where, when and why. INTRODUCTION The advent of biologic therapies for severe asthma has profoundly changed the management of this pathology. The introduction of home administration is therefore an important innovation to optimize the patients' management, even if there are many aspects that need to be clarified and pointed out. AREAS COVERED This review summarizes the path that led to the possibility of self-administration of biologics, and what the pandemic has changed in the management of these patients. EXPERT OPINION The growing understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes is enabling the careful selection of patients suitable for biologics. In this context, the availability of reliable and simple self-injection devices is important in implementing self-administration. The transition to self-injection is also possible thanks to the high safety profile of biologics. With attention, most patients may potentially be suitable for self-administration. The transition process from hospital to home administration can therefore be carried out correctly by clinicians with adequate expertise in the field of severe asthma and biologic therapies, with the support of other health professionals, pharmacists, and general practitioners. Home administration is probably the best way to guarantee high adherence and high-level satisfaction of patients, even in the long term.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1498,35325134,"A communication procedure between community pharmacists and primary care professionals resolves medication errors and other administrative issues. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to implement a communication procedure, with agreed-upon protocols, to resolve daily medication errors and other administrative issues that require communication between community pharmacists (CPs) and primary healthcare professionals (PHCPs). METHODS A 6-month pilot study followed by a year-length principal study was carried out in the Donostialdea Integrated Healthcare Organisation (IHO). Afterwards, the project was extended to other IHOs. The CPs identified medication errors or other administrative issues that required communication with PHCPs, contacting the customer service staff by telephone for urgent problems and by email for non-urgent problems. KEY FINDINGS In total, 49 community pharmacies participated in the study. A total of 1179 medication errors and other administrative issues were detected, and over 90% of problems were solved in less than 24 h (n = 1079, 91.5%). Email was the more frequently used communication method (n = 874, 74.1%), and the most prevalent problems were due to absent (n = 766, 65.0%) and expired (n = 226, 19.2%) electronic prescriptions. Most of the participants were satisfied with the programme.

1499,35325143,"Seasonal influenza vaccination in pharmacy in France: description and determinants of the vaccinated at-risk population using this service, 1 year after implementation. OBJECTIVES Vaccination of the at-risk population against influenza by pharmacists was widely implemented in France in 2019. Only little data are available about the population using this service. We have explored the characteristics and determinants of the at-risk population vaccinated in pharmacy through a web-based cohort during the 2019-20 winter season. METHODS This study is based on the data of the profile survey of at-risk over-18 vaccinated participants of the cohort GrippeNet.fr, for the 2019-20 winter season. Population characteristics were described using the inclusion questionnaire data. Factors associated with pharmacy influenza vaccination were analysed through a logistic regression model. KEY FINDINGS In total, 3144 people were included in the study. 50.2% (N = 1577) of them were women and 65.5% (N = 2060) were over 65 years old. 29.5% (N = 928) of participants were vaccinated in pharmacy. 73.1% (N = 678) of participants vaccinated in pharmacy were over 65 years old and 46.6% (N = 432) had a treatment for one or more chronic disease. Factors positively associated with being vaccinated by a pharmacist were: being a man (OR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [1.06-1.47]), being over 65 years old (OR = 1.97 [1.49-2.63]), living in a test region (OR = 1.62 [1.29-2.02] and 1.72 [1.43-2.07] depending on the year of the implementation of the experimentation) and being vaccinated against influenza in 2018/2019 (OR = 1.71 [1.32-2.21]). Factors negatively associated were: taking a chronic treatment (OR = 0.83 [0.70-0.97]), and living alone (OR = 1.40 [1.17-1.67] and being in contact with sick people (OR = 0.68 [0.50-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed some factors associated with pharmacy influenza vaccination and feeds the debate on other uncertain factors. These findings can support public health authorities' willingness to enhance pharmacists' involvement in the future country-wide vaccination campaign. Our study also highlights the necessity to further investigate the impact of this measure in a few years.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1500,35325201,"Effectiveness of pharmacological-based interventions including education and prescribing strategies to reduce subacute pain following total hip or knee arthroplasty: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials. BACKGROUND Total knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA, THA) surgeries are among the most common elective procedures. Moderate to severe postoperative pain during the subacute period (defined here as the period from hospital discharge to 3 months postoperatively) is a predictor of persistent pain 12 months postoperatively. This review aimed to examine the available post-discharge pharmacological interventions, including educational and prescribing strategies, and their effect on reducing pain during the subacute period after TKA or THA. METHODS We searched seven electronic databases from inception to 22 April 2021. Published randomised controlled trials of adults who underwent TKA or THA and received a pharmacological-based intervention commencing within one week after hospital discharge and conducted for up to three months postoperatively were compared to any treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data on the primary outcome, pain intensity. This review was registered prospectively on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021250384). RESULTS Four trials involving 660 participants were included. Interventions included changing analgesic prescribing practices upon hospital discharge and education on analgesic use. Providing multimodal non-opioid analgesia in addition to reduced opioid quantity was associated with lower subacute pain (Coeff -0.81; 95% CI -1.33 to -0.29; p = 0.003). Education on analgesic use during multidisciplinary home visits was effective for reducing pain intensity during the subacute period (6.25 ± 10.13 vs. 35.67 ± 22.05; p < 0.001) compared to usual care.

1501,35325584,"North Carolina Pharmacists' Support for Hormonal Contraception Prescription Status Change. BACKGROUND Pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception (HC) may offer additional avenues of access for patients; however, it is unknown whether pharmacists would support over-the-counter access to contraception over pharmacist-prescribed models. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to understand how North Carolina (NC) pharmacists believed HC should be classified and how pharmacist and pharmacy characteristics were associated with those beliefs. METHODS This study was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey completed by 587 licensed NC pharmacists. The primary outcome of interest was how pharmacists believed HC should be classified: prescription-only, pharmacist-prescribed, behind-the-counter, or over-the-counter. Multinomial bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to describe the association between pharmacist and pharmacy characteristics with the outcomes of interest through odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios, respectively. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association of geographic location with distribution of attitudes toward HC classification. RESULTS Fifty-one percent of NC pharmacists supported classification of HC as pharmacist-prescribed, while 23% supported non-prescription (behind- or over-the-counter) classification. Controlling for pharmacist demographics and pharmacy characteristics, completing residency training was significantly associated with supporting pharmacist-prescribed vs prescription-only classification (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.55, P = .02). Pharmacists had higher odds of supporting pharmacist-prescribed vs prescription-only HC if they agreed that they were well trained to do so (aOR = 3.14, P < .01). Distribution of attitudes about classification of HC did not significantly differ by geographic location (P = .14). CONCLUSIONS Most NC pharmacists support deviating from the current prescription-only classification of HC, with more support for pharmacist-prescribed classification. Continuing education programs should focus on training pharmacists to feel more confident prescribing HC.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1502,35326793,"Impact of the Acceptance of the Recommendations Made by a Meropenem Stewardship Program in a University Hospital: A Pilot Study.  Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) promote appropriate antimicrobial use. We present a 4-year retrospective study that evaluated the clinical impact of the acceptance of the recommendations made by a meropenem-focused ASP. A total of 318 meropenem audits were performed. The ASP team (comprising infectious disease physicians, pharmacists and microbiologists) considered meropenem use in 96 audits (30.2%) to be inappropriate. The reasons to consider these uses inappropriate were the possibility of de-escalating to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic, in 66 (68.7%) audits, and unnecessary meropenem use, in 30 (31.3%) audits. The ASP team recommended de-escalation in 66 audits (68.7%) and discontinuation of meropenem in 30 audits (31.3%). ASP interventions were stratified according to whether or not recommendations were followed. The group in which recommendations were accepted and followed (i.e., accepted audit, AA) included 66 audits (68.7%) and the group in which recommendations were not followed (i.e., rejected audit, RA) included 30 (31.3%) audits. The comorbidity of the AA group (Charlson score) was higher than in the RA group (7.0 (5.0-9.0) vs. 6.0 (4.0-7.0), p = 0.02). Discontinuation of meropenem was recommended in 83.3% of audits in the AA group vs. 62.2% in the RA group (OR 3.05 (1.03-8.99), p = 0.04). Ertapenem de-escalation resulted in a 100% greater rate of follow-up compared with the non-carbapenem option (100% vs. 51.9%, OR 1.50 (1.21-1.860), p = 0.001). Significant differences were observed in the AA group when cultures were taken before antibiotic prescription-98.5% vs. 83.3% (p = 0.01, OR 13.0 (1.45-116.86))-or when screening cultures were taken-45.5% vs. 19.2% (p = 0.03, OR 3.5 (1.06-11.52)). There were no differences between the groups in terms of overall mortality and 30-day mortality, length of stay, Clostridiodes difficile infection, 30-day readmission or hospitalization costs.

1503,35326844,"Interprofessional Collaboration between ICU Physicians, Staff Nurses, and Hospital Pharmacists Optimizes Antimicrobial Treatment and Improves Quality of Care and Economic Outcome.  (1) Background: Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide health threat. The WHO published a global strategic plan in 2001 to contain antimicrobial resistance. In the following year, a workshop identified crucial barriers to the implementation of the strategy, e.g., underdeveloped health infrastructures and the scarcity of valid data as well as a lack of implementation of antibiotic stewardship (ABS) programs in medical curricula. Here, we show that interprofessional learning and education can contribute to the optimization of antibiotic use and preserving antibiotic effectiveness. We have initiated interprofessional rounds on a medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a focus on gastroenterology, hepatology, infectious diseases, endocrinology, and liver transplantation. We integrated ICU physicians, hospital pharmacists, nursing staff, and medical students as well as students of pharmacy to broaden the rather technical concept of ABS with an interprofessional approach to conceptualize awareness and behavioral change in antibiotic prescription and use. Methods: Clinical performance data and consumption figures for antibiotics were analyzed over a 10-year period from 2012 to 2021. The control period covered the years 2012-2014. The intervention period comprised the years 2015-2021, following the implementation of an interprofessional approach to ABS at a MICU of a German university hospital. Data from the hospital pharmacy, hospital administration, and hospital information system were included in the analyses. A specific electronic platform was developed for the optimization of documentation, interprofessional learning, education, and sustainability. The years 2020 and 2021 were analyzed independently due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the care of numerous COVID-19 patients at the MICU. Results: Implementation of an interprofessional ABS program resulted in the optimization of antibiotic management at the MICU. The suggestions of the hospital pharmacist for optimization can be divided into the following categories (i) indication for and selection of therapy (43.6%), (ii) optimization of dosing (27.6%), (iii) drug interactions (9.4%), (iv) side effects (4.1%), and (v) other pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacoeconomic topics (15.3%). These suggestions were discussed among the interprofessional team at the MICU; 86.1% were consequently implemented and the prescription of antibiotics was changed. In addition, further analysis of the intensive care German Diagnosis Related Groups (G-DRGs) showed that the case mix points increased significantly by 31.6% during the period under review. Accordingly, the severity of illness of the patients treated at the ICU as measured by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II increased by 21.4% and the proportion of mechanically ventilated patients exceeded 50%. Antibiotic spending per case mix point was calculated. While spending was EUR 60.22 per case mix point in 2015, this was reduced by 42.9% to EUR 34.37 per case mix point by 2019, following the implementation of the interprofessional ABS program on the MICU. Through close interprofessional collaboration between physicians, hospital pharmacists, and staff nurses, the consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g., carbapenems, was significantly reduced, thus improving patient care. In parallel, the case mix and case mix index increased. Thus, the responsible use of resources and high-performance medicine are not contradictory. In our view, close interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration between physicians, pharmacists, and nursing staff will be of outstanding importance in the future to prepare health care professionals for global health care to ensure that the effectiveness of our antibiotics is preserved.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,"Infectious diseases, Critical care",,,,Inpatient,
1504,35326862,"Effective Clinical Pathway Improves Interprofessional Collaboration and Reduces Antibiotics Prophylaxis Use in Orthopedic Surgery in Hospitals in Indonesia.  Clinical pathways can improve the quality of health services. The effectiveness and impact of implementing clinical pathways are controversial. The preparation of clinical pathways not only enacts therapeutic guidelines but requires mutual agreement in accordance with the roles, duties, and contributions of each profession in the team. This study aimed to investigate the perception of interprofessional collaboration practices and the impact of clinical pathway implementation on collaborative and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) prophylactic antibiotics per 100 bed-days in orthopedic surgery. The Collaborative Practice Assessment Tool (CPAT) questionnaire was used as a tool to measure healthcare' perceptions of collaborative practice. The clinical pathway (CP) in this study was adapted from existing CPs published by the Indonesian Orthopaedic Association (Perhimpunan Dokter Spesialis Orthopaedi dan Traumatologi Indonesia, PABOI) and was commended by local domestic surgeons and orthopedic bodies. We then compared post-implementation results with pre-implementation clinical pathway data using ANCOVA to explore our categorical data and its influence towards CPAT response. ANOVA was then employed for aggregated DDD per 100 bed-days to compare pre and post intervention. The results showed that the relationships among members were associated with the working length. Six to ten years of working had a significantly better relationship among members than those who have worked one to five years. Interestingly, pharmacists' leadership score was significantly lower than other professions. The clinical pathway implementation reduced barriers in team collaboration, improved team coordination and organization, and reduced third-generation cephalosporin use for prophylaxis in surgery (pre: 59 DDD per 100 bed-days; post: 28 DDD per 100 bed-days). This shows that the clinical pathway could benefit antibiotic stewardship in improving antibiotic prescription, therefore reducing the incidence of resistant bacteria.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1505,35326981,"Community Pharmacists' Knowledge, Willingness, and Readiness to Prescribe Oral Contraceptives in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND The role of community pharmacists (CPs) in various healthcare settings is well documented in the literature including providing safe and easy access to medications. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) are the most frequently used method of terminating unwanted pregnancies worldwide. OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the Community pharmacist's knowledge, willingness, and readiness to prescribe OCPs in Saudi communities in Saudi Arabia. METHODS This is across sectional, self-administered questionnaire-based study conducted between May and November 2021 in the central region of Saudi Arabia. The results were presented as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square tests were used to sort significant association between groups. RESULTS Out of 368 CPs who got the questionnaire, 347 completed (94.3%). Most of CPs were be-tween the ages of 25 and 35, with 76.9% working in chain pharmacies. Of the surveyed CPs, 45.5% had &gt;24 months of experience in community pharmacies. 41.8% of them prescribed more than six prescriptions for OCPs/week. The patients' safety (77.2%), physician's resistance (54.5%), and CPs objection based on religious purposes (36.9%) and lack of time (29.7%) were the most commonly cited barriers among CPs. CPs who worked in chain pharmacies were significantly too busy (p = 0.038) to prescribe OCPs. Also, community pharmacists with experience of more than two years significantly agreed not to prescribe OCPs due to religious convictions (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION The current study revealed that most of the CPs were knowledgeable about OCPs. Additionally, most of them were likely to prescribe oral contraceptives. We further suggest overcoming the barriers associated with contraceptives among CPs and providing sufficient training to improve the oral contraceptive prescriptions in CPs is needed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1506,35327028,"Evaluating the Impact of Medication Risk Mitigation Services in Medically Complex Older Adults.  Adverse drug events (ADEs) represent an expensive societal burden that disproportionally affects older adults. Therefore, value-based organizations that provide care to older adults-such as the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)-should be highly motivated to identify actual or potential ADEs to mitigate risks and avoid downstream costs. We sought to determine whether PACE participants receiving medication risk mitigation (MRM) services exhibit improvements in total healthcare costs and other outcomes compared to participants not receiving structured MRM. Data from 2545 PACE participants from 19 centers were obtained for the years 2018 and 2019. We compared the year-over-year changes in outcomes between patients not receiving (control) or receiving structured MRM services. Data were adjusted based on participant multimorbidity and geographic location. Our analyses demonstrate that costs in the MRM cohort exhibited a significantly smaller year-to-year increase compared to the control (MRM: USD 4386/participant/year [95% CI, USD 3040-5732] vs. no MRM: USD 9410/participant/year [95% CI, USD 7737-11,084]). Therefore, receipt of structured MRM services reduced total healthcare costs (p &lt; 0.001) by USD 5024 per participant from 2018 to 2019. The large majority (75.8%) of the reduction involved facility-related expenditures (e.g., hospital admission, emergency department visits, skilled nursing). In sum, our findings suggest that structured MRM services can curb growing year-over-year healthcare costs for PACE participants.",0,0,1,1,0,Unclear if pharmacist performed intervention.,,,,,,,,,
1507,35327033,"Applying Simulation Optimization to Minimize Drug Inventory Costs: A Study of a Case Outpatient Pharmacy.  Drug inventory management is an important part of hospital management. The large amounts of drug data in hospitals bring challenges to optimizing the setting values for the safety stock and the maximum inventory of each drug. This study combined a two-stage clustering method with an inventory policy (s, S) and established a simulation optimization model for the case hospital's outpatient pharmacy. This research used the simulation optimization software Arena OptQuest, developed by Rockwell Automation Inc (Rockwell Automation, Coraopolis, PA, USA), in order to determine the minimum and maximum values (s, S) of the best stock amounts for each drug under the considerations of cost and related inventory constraints. The research results showed that the minimum and maximum inventory settings for each drug in the simulation model were better than those set by the case outpatient pharmacy system. The average inventory cost was reduced by 55%, while the average inventory volume was reduced by 68%. The proposed method can improve management efficiency and inventory costs of hospital pharmacies without affecting patient services and increasing the inventory turnover rate of the drugs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of appropriate medicines for children has a significant impact on health care practices in various countries around the world, including Thailand. The unavailability of pediatric medicines in hospital formularies causes issues regarding off-label use and extemporaneous preparation, resulting in safety and quality risks relating to the use of medicines among children. This research aimed to identify missing pediatric formulations based on the experience of healthcare professionals in a teaching hospital in northern Thailand. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data on missing pediatric formulations, the reasons for their inaccessibility, their off-label uses, their reactions to the situation, and suggestions to improve access to these identified medications. The survey was distributed to all physicians, nurses, and pharmacists involved in prescribing, preparing, dispensing, and administering pediatric medicines. A total of 218 subjects responded to the survey. Omeprazole, sildenafil, and spironolactone suspension were most often identified as missing formulations for children by physicians and pharmacists. They are unavailable on the Thai market or in any hospital formulary. For nurses, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and chloral hydrate were the most problematic formulations in terms of preparation, acceptability, and administration.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is responsible for an important premature mortality. Pharmacists involved in community-based pharmaceutical care services could help patients with diabetes through education and management as they participate in their regular and long-term care. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between interventions led by pharmacists in the primary care setting and mean change in HbA1c levels. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with a control group were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the mean change in HbA1c values between baseline and end of the intervention in each group.

The availability of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and other methods for personalizing medicine now allows evaluation of their real-world impact on healthcare delivery. For example, addressing issues associated with polypharmacy in older patients using pharmacogenomics (PGx) and comprehensive medication management (CMM) is thought to hold great promise for meaningful improvements across the goals of the Quadruple Aim. However, few studies testing these tools at scale, using relevant system-wide metrics, and under real-world conditions, have been published to date.

Introduction: High tacrolimus intrapatient variability is associated with poor outcomes following transplantation. A commonly hypothesized cause of this variability is medication non-adherence, but this has not been conclusively demonstrated. Research Question: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between medication adherence and tacrolimus intrapatient variability. Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of kidney transplant recipients. Adherence was assessed at the 12-month clinic visit as a composite of patient self-report, pharmacist assessment, and lab monitoring frequency. Tacrolimus intrapatient variability was calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV). Linear regression and receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis were used to assess the relationship between adherence and CV. Results: Nonadherence was identified in 37.5% of patients. The median CV was 27.1% for adherent patients and 29.8% for non-adherent patients (P = 0.051). In the multivariable analysis, the only significant predictor of CV was the incidence of dose changes (P = 0.002). ROC analysis demonstrated poor discriminant power with an AUC of 0.597. Discussion: The results fail to support a clinically meaningful relationship between medication adherence and tacrolimus CV. There is very little evidence at this time that adherence is the primary contributing factor to tacrolimus intrapatient variability and, by extension, that CV can be used as a surrogate for adherence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND With the necessary skills available to community pharmacists, they are well equipped to relieve pressure on hospitals and general practices by providing referral services for symptomatic patients for COVID-19 testing. OBJECTIVE The assessment of potential barriers that limit the successful implementation of a community pharmacy referral service for patients with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS A questionnaire comprising of 100 questions was administered to one pharmacist by interview in 1023 working community pharmacies in 4 regions of Egypt between May 17 and May 30th 2020. RESULTS Forty-five barriers were identified. Respondents (79%, n = 803) had difficulty obtaining an accurate patient history. Patient data confidentiality was a significant issue for pharmacists who had not received referral training, with these respondents being significantly (P = .010) less able to differentiate between COVID-19 and similar conditions. Respondents (68.8%, n = 698) were not confident in determining whether COVID-19 was the cause of the patient's presenting symptoms. A large majority (73.7%, n = 747) of respondents were worried about referring misdiagnosed patients and were concerned about the negative implications of proceeding with such a referral, including legal consequences. Of Respondents (71.7%, n = 727) reported that online referral was not easy, and 71.6% (n = 722) were unable to locate paper referral forms. Only a small number of pharmacists (11%, n = 112) preferred to report a referral in their own name. CONCLUSIONS This study has demonstrated the potential of the community pharmacist's role as a point of referral for COVID-19 testing, and identified some major barriers to implementation of this. The lack of pharmacists' education, legal support, availability of referral forms, clarity of responsibility and unsupportive management teams are key obstacles that must be overcome for the successful implementation of a COVID-19 referral service.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1514,35331122,"Potential Drug-Drug Interactions Between Anti-Cancer Drugs and Other Medications in Lung Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Study. BACKGROUND Cancer patients are more vulnerable to developing drug-drug interactions as multiple medications are administered concomitantly with cytotoxic agents to treat the underlying comorbidities. These drug-drug interactions often receive less medical attention and consequently are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE We intended to comprehensively characterize the drug-drug interactions among anticancer drugs and other concomitantly prescribed drugs in hospitalized lung cancer patients. METHODS A retrospective, observational, single-centre study was conducted on lung cancer inpatients from the medical records department of Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, India. Drug-drug interactions were identified using the drug interaction checkers of two drug information databases, Micromedex and Epocrates. These drug-drug interactions were categorized based on the source from which they were identified, mechanism, severity/significance, adverse consequences, and management strategies required. RESULTS Among 196 patients, 555 drug-drug interactions were identified in 185 patients using Micromedex and Epocrates. Based on the mechanism of action, 74% and 22% of the drug-drug interactions were classified as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic respectively. 112 drug-drug interactions were recorded from Micromedex alone, while 549 interactions were found using Epocrates. The oral chemotherapeutic drug gefitinib was found to be associated with the highest number of drug-drug interactions. CONCLUSION Drug-drug interactions were highly prevalent among the hospitalized lung cancer patients. Structured screening and monitoring for these potentially clinically relevant drug-drug interactions by oncologists in collaborations with clinical pharmacists should be carried out prior to initiation and during anticancer treatment to prevent adverse clinical outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Infectious diseases like the common cold, otitis media, or gastroenteritis frequently occur in childhood. In addition to prescription drugs, parents often use supplementary over-the-counter (OTC) products recommended by pharmacists and other non-medical professionals to relieve their children's symptoms. However, the efficacy of such alternative treatments lacks conclusive evidence. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of OTC products and related active ingredients in children, and the motivations behind this choice. METHODS The present study included 215 children aged between 1 and 14 years with an acute respiratory tract infection, e.g., common cold, bronchitis, otitis media, tonsillitis, or gastroenteritis. During their visit to the pediatric practice, parents filled in a self-administered questionnaire about their child's diagnosis, additional treatment options, and motivations to integrate supplementary medicinal products after their first visit for acute infection or follow-up examination. Children with chronic illnesses and patients visiting for a routine maternal and child health program check-up were excluded. RESULTS The study included 111 (51.6%) males and 104 (48.4%) females. Median age was 3.00 (IQR 2.0 - 5.0) years. The most common reason for a visit was a respiratory tract infection (78.6%). Out of 215 parents, 182 (84.7%) resorted to non-prescription remedies to alleviate their child's symptoms. Teas (45.1%), and home remedies (43.3%) were the most popular. At total 133 (74.3%) followed recommendations from friends and family regarding additional medications usage. Parents with previous experience with complementary medicine tended to prefer this approach to treat their children (p.adjust = 0.08).

1516,35331488,"Clinical nutrition and the role of hospital pharmacist in the management of covid patient.  The nutritional status of everyone represents a fundamental element to maintain a good health and it can be related to infectious agents in some disorders. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should be included in the management of SARS-CoV-2 patients in order to improve both short- and long-term prognosis. In Covid patients the choice of route of administration for nutrition is closely related to respiratory autonomy. In subjects who are not mechanically ventilated or with non-invasive ventilation (NIV), spontaneous oral feeding is strongly indicated, while considering the patient's comorbidity, chewing ability and swallowing. If this is not possible or if it is not possible to meet the appropriate nutritional needs, it is necessary to resort to artificial nutrition (enteral or parenteral). Enteral nutrition (EN) is preferred to parenteral nutrition (PN) because it allows to maintain the trophism of the gastrointestinal tract, involving a lower risk of infectious complications and it is easier to manage. PN is usually used in patients in whom NE is not feasible, insufficient or contraindicated, or in patients with invasive total mechanical ventilation. Based on these considerations, it would be necessary to develop a targeted nutritional pathway in order to support the management of Covid patients. In the nutritional management of these patients, the role of the hospital pharmacists is fundamental. They collaborate with clinicians, nutritionist, dieticians and speech therapists to choose the most appropriate nutrition, based on the clinical characteristics of the patient and on the availability of nutritional formulations in the therapeutic guide.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS A multidisciplinary group of experts in patient safety was set up to define what signals the new AI system must emit to improve ADEs management in OAAs. The baseline data for the new AI system were generated through an observational and ambispective study carried out in a university hospital. All patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected consecutively every working day for 6 months. The ADEs were collected by interview and by the review of health records. The ADEs were categorised according to how they could be detected: patient, analysis, examination. RESULTS The group defined what signals the AI system must emit to improve ADEs management in OAAs: a signal to educate the patient when the possible ADEs were categorised as patient, a signal as a reminder to request a blood test or a microbiological culture when the possible ADEs were categorised as analysis, and a signal as a reminder for the necessity of a clinical examination when the possible ADEs were categorised as examination. A total of 1652 ADEs were reported in the interviews (ADE-interview) with the pharmacist, and doctors noted 1989 ADEs in the health record (ADE-HR).

1521,35332787,"Comparing and validating medication complexity from insurance claims against electronic health records.  BACKGROUND: Patient effort to comply with complex medication instructions is known to be related to nonadherence and subsequent medical complications or health care costs. A widely used Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) has been used with electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients who could benefit from pharmacist intervention. A similar claims-derived measure may be better suited for clinical decision support, since claims offer a more complete view of patient care and health utilization. OBJECTIVE: To define and validate a novel insurance claims-based medication complexity score (MCS) patterned after the widely used MRCI, derived from EHRs. METHODS: Insurance claims and EHR data were provided by HealthPartners (N = 54,988) (Bloomington, Minnesota) and The Johns Hopkins Health System (N = 28,589) (Baltimore, Maryland) for years 2013 and 2017, respectively. Yearly measures of medication complexity were developed for each patient and evaluated with one another using rank correlation within different clinical subgroupings. Indicators for the presence of individually complex prescriptions were also developed and assessed using exact agreement. Complexity measures were then correlated with select covariates to further validate the concordance between MCS and MRCI with respect to clinical metrics. These included demographic, comorbidity, and health care utilization markers. Prescribed medications in each system's EHR were coded using the previously validated MRCI weighting rules. Insurance claims for retail pharmacy medications were coded using our novel MCS, which closely followed MRCI scoring rules. RESULTS: EHR-based MRCI and claims-based MCS were significantly correlated with one another for most clinical subgroupings. Likewise, both measures were correlated with several covariates, including count of active medications and chronic conditions. The MCS was, in most cases, more associated with key health covariates than was MRCI, although both were consistently significant. We found that the highest correlation between MCS and MRCI is obtained with patients who have similar counts of pharmacy records between EHRs and claims (HealthPartners: P = 0.796; Johns Hopkins Health System: P = 0.779). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest good correspondence between MCS and MRCI and that claims data represent a useful resource for assessing medication complexity. Claims data also have major practical advantages, such as interoperability across health care systems, although they lack the detailed clinical context of EHRs.

1522,35332788,"Analysis of a panel-based pharmacogenomics testing program among members of a commercial and Medicare client of a pharmacy benefits manager.  BACKGROUND: Although the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx) has existed for decades, use of pharmacogenomic information by providers to optimize medication therapy for patients has had relatively slow adoption. There are many factors that have contributed to the slow adoption of PGx testing, but it is partially due to a lack of coverage by payers. If PGx testing is covered by payers, frequently only testing of a specific gene is covered, rather than a panel of many genes. As a result, little is known about how coverage of a panel-based PGx test will affect a member's medication therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine how giving providers specific medication optimization recommendations, based on results of a panel-based PGx test, impacted members' medication regimens. METHODS: Pharmacy claims data were retrospectively reviewed for this exploratory study. Members who participated in PGx testing were in the intervention group and members who chose not to participate in the PGx testing, but who were eligible to participate, were in the control group. PGx test results, including suggested medication changes, were mailed to providers. To determine if providers adopted the suggested medication changes, pharmacy claims data were analyzed retrospectively for the 4-month period preceding and following the date from which recommendations were provided to prescribers. RESULTS: Of the 101 members included in the analysis, 50 were in the intervention group and 51 were in the control group. In the intervention group, members were taking in a total of 352 medications; 165 of the medications had PGx guidance. Based on the PGx test results, 62 of these medications (37.6%) had recommendations. Of members who received PGx testing, 76% had at least 1 recommended change. When pharmacist recommendations were made, a change was made to the medication 27% of the time. There was a statistically significant difference between the number of medication changes in the PGx group and the control group (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations based on PGx testing can lead to changes in medications and an optimized medication regimen for members.

BACKGROUND Transition-related patient safety errors are high among patients discharged from hospitals to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and interventions are needed to improve communication between hospitals and SNF providers. Our objective was to describe the implementation of a pilot telehealth videoconference program modeled after Extension for Community Health Outcomes-Care Transitions and examine patient safety errors and readmissions. METHODS A multidisciplinary telehealth videoconference program was implemented at two academic hospitals for patients discharged to participating SNFs. Process measures, patient safety errors, and hospital readmissions were evaluated retrospectively for patients discussed at weekly conferences between July 2019-January 2020. Results were mapped to the constructs of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) model. Descriptive statistics were reported for the conference process measures, patient and index hospitalization characteristics, and patient safety errors. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause 30-day readmissions. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was conducted using logistic regression models fit to compare the probability of 30-day hospital readmission in patients discharged to participating SNFs across 7 months prior to after telehealth project implementation. RESULTS There were 263 patients (67% of eligible patients) discussed during 26 telehealth videoconferences. Mean discussion time per patient was 7.7 min and median prep time per patient was 24.2 min for the hospital pharmacist and 10.3 min for the hospital clinician. A total of 327 patient safety errors were uncovered, mostly related to communication (54%) and medications (43%). Differences in slopes (program period vs. pre-implementation) of the probability of readmission across the two time periods were not statistically significant (OR 0.95, [95% CI 0.75, 1.19]).

1529,35334546,"Experience of Vancomycin Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Two Multidisciplinary Hospitals in Latvia.  Background and Objectives: Management of infectious diseases is a huge burden to every healthcare system worldwide. Antimicrobial resistance, including antibacterial resistance, is an increasing problem worldwide; therefore, more new antibiotics are necessary to be discovered. Meanwhile, ""old"" antibacterial agents are still administered to fight infectious diseases caused by resistant bacteria. One of these antibacterial agents is vancomycin, which is effective in treating serious systemic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. Thus, it is necessary to perform vancomycin concentration measurements in plasma due to its narrow therapeutic index. Various approaches are implemented for more precise therapy, including therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin and with a supervision of a clinical pharmacist. The purpose of the study was to investigate if the TDM practice is improved with a local vancomycin TDM protocol applied in a hospital. The results of TDM in two multidisciplinary hospitals, one with a local TDM protocol implemented and applied and the other with no local TDM protocol implemented and applied, were compared. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed in two multidisciplinary hospitals in Latvia. The data were collected for a time period of 4 years (2016-2020) in a hospital without a local TDM protocol and for a time period of 2 years (2018-2020) in a hospital with a local TDM protocol, starting with a period of time when the vancomycin TDM protocol was developed. The data about the patients included in the study were analyzed based on gender, age, body weight, and renal function. Vancomycin therapy was analyzed based on dosing schemes (vancomycin dose and dosing interval), data about loading and maintenance doses, vancomycin concentration, and details about vancomycin concentration (sampling time and concentration level). Results: Differences between the hospitals were found in terms of the initiation of vancomycin administration and concentration sampling. In the hospital with a TDM protocol compared with the hospital without a TDM protocol, more accurate initiation was found, alongside adaption of therapy (97.22% vs. 18.95%, p &lt; 0.001), better performance of administration of a loading dose (22.73% vs. 1.29%, p &lt; 0.01), and reaching of target concentration (55.56% vs. 35.29%, p &lt; 0.01). Concentration sampling in the correct timeframe before the vancomycin dose and vancomycin administration did not show statistically better results in either of the hospitals (4.60% vs. 6.29%, p = 0.786). Conclusions: Better results of adequate adjustments of vancomycin therapy were achieved in the hospital with a TDM protocol. In the long term, sustainable results and regular medical professionals' training is necessary.",0,0,1,1,0,Unclear what pharmacist actually performed intervention of was in a supervisory role.,,,,,,,,,

Polypharmacy of psychotropic medications predisposes older adults to adverse drug events (ADEs). One contributing factor is inhibition of metabolic pathways between substrates (competitive inhibition) or between substrates and inhibitors of the same cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoforms. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate observed sedation and difficulty concentrating from augmentation therapy for resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) and to highlight the value of clinical tools to identify opportunities for treatment optimization to reduce ADEs. The pharmacist identified significant medication burden and competitive inhibition of drug metabolism in the CYP450 system during a telehealth medication therapy management consultation with a 69-year-old male. The pharmacist recommended clinical monitoring and communicated concerns about medication-induced sedation, difficulty concentrating, and other medication-related problems (MRP) to providers.

1533,35334884,"Development of Therapeutic and Prophylactic Zinc Compositions for Use against COVID-19: A Glimpse of the Trends, Inventions, and Patents.  Zinc is an essential nutrient for human health; it is involved in the catalytic, structural, and regulatory functions of the human cellular system. Different compositions of zinc, as well as its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are available on the market. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of zinc in combating COVID-19. It has been determined that zinc prevents the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells by lowering the expression of ACE-2 receptors and inhibiting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. Zinc also prevents the cytokine storm that takes place after the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, via its anti-inflammatory activity. The authors believe that no study has yet been published that has reviewed the trends, inventions, and patent literature of zinc compositions to treat/prevent COVID-19. Accordingly, this review has been written in order to fill this gap in the literature. The information about the clinical studies and the published patents/patent applications was retrieved from different databases. This review covers patent literature on zinc compositions up to 31 January 2022. Many important patents/patent applications for zinc-based compositions filed by innovative universities and industries were identified. The patent literature revealed zinc compositions in combination with zinc ionophores, antioxidants, antivirals, antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, heparin, ivermectin, and copper. Most of these studies were supported by clinical trials. The patent literature supports the potential of zinc and its pharmaceutical compositions as possible treatments for COVID-19. The authors believe that countless zinc-based compositions are still unexplored, and there is an immense opportunity to evaluate a considerable number of the zinc-based compositions for use against COVID-19.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing support for HPV vaccination in the pharmacy setting, but the availability of the HPV vaccine is not well known. Additionally, little is known about perceptions of medical providers regarding referring patients to community pharmacies for HPV vaccination. The purpose of this study was to determine HPV vaccine availability in community pharmacies and to understand, among family medicine and obstetrics-gynecology providers, the willingness of and perceived barriers to referring patients for HPV vaccination in a pharmacy setting. HPV vaccine availability data were collected from pharmacies in a southern region of the United States. Family medicine and obstetrics-gynecology providers were surveyed regarding vaccine referral practices and perceived barriers to HPV vaccination in a community pharmacy. Results indicated the HPV vaccine was available in most pharmacies. Providers were willing to refer patients to a community pharmacy for HPV vaccination, despite this not being a common practice, likely due to numerous barriers reported.

1535,35335066,"Safety Profile of COVID-19 Vaccines among Healthcare Workers in Poland.  The aim of the study was to compare the safety profiles (prevalence of both local and systemic side effects) of COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca) among healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, and pharmacists) administered with a first and a second dose of the vaccines. Another goal of the research was to evaluate potential demographic and clinical risk factors for the frequency and intensity of side effects. A post-marketing, cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out on a sample of 971 respondents (323 doctors, 324 nurses, and 324 pharmacists), all more than 18 years old, who have taken two doses of the following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) (group 1), mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (group 2), and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) (group 3). A validated, self-administered questionnaire was developed and delivered online to the target population group of healthcare workers. The survey was conducted during the third wave of the COVID-19 (1 February 2021-1 July 2021) pandemic. It was based on the CAWI (computer-assisted web interview) method. Questionnaires were disseminated using selected social media. The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine was the most commonly administered COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare professionals in Poland (69.61%). Side effects following a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were reported by 53.11% of respondents in group 1, 72% in group 2, and 67.59% in group 3. The following were the most common side effects regardless of the type of vaccine administered: pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, fever, chills, and fatigue. The number and intensity of reported side effects following administration of a BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine were significantly lower than in the other two study groups (p &lt; 0.00001). Risk factors for side effects following administration of one of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines subject to the analysis included being female, young, and suffering from a diagnosed allergy. Our results clearly show that the short-term safety profiles of the eligible COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca) are acceptable. Nevertheless, the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines available in Poland differ significantly in the frequency of both local and systemic side effects and their intensity.

1536,35335072,"Assessment of Satisfaction with Pharmacist-Administered COVID-19 Vaccinations in France: PharmaCoVax. BACKGROUND COVID-19 vaccines are among the most effective measures to reduce serious illness and death from infection with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus. To improve vaccine accessibility, pharmacists in France have been authorized to administer COVID-19 vaccinations since March 2021. This study aims to assess satisfaction among French people receiving their COVID-19 vaccination from a community pharmacist. METHODOLOGY The PharmaCoVax study was conducted in French community pharmacies from 16 March to 30 June 2021. Interested pharmacists completed an online participation form, giving them access to the self-administered questionnaire. People receiving a pharmacist-administered COVID-19 vaccination completed this questionnaire in the pharmacy. RESULTS Among the 442 pharmacists involved, 123 actively participated in the study. Overall, 5733 completed questionnaires were analyzed. A proportion of 59% (n = 3388) of those who received a pharmacist-administered COVID-19 vaccination had previously received their influenza vaccination, most often in the same pharmacy (n = 1744). Only 24% (n = 1370) of people visiting a pharmacy had tried to obtain their COVID-19 vaccination elsewhere. Satisfaction was excellent with a rating of 4.92 out of 5.00, and the net promoter score was 93. CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist-administered COVID-19 vaccination service was overwhelmingly appreciated by users. The trust placed in pharmacists may explain the desire to have them perform additional vaccinations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1537,35335106,"Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceptions and Vaccination Acceptance/Hesitancy among the Community Pharmacists of Palermo's Province, Italy: From Influenza to COVID-19.  In Italy, following the start of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, community pharmacies (CPs) were recruited on a voluntary basis in order to administer COVID-19 vaccines as part of their activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention, and vaccine acceptance/hesitancy towards COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations among the community pharmacists operating in the Palermo Province. A cross-sectional study was conducted, with two different questionnaires administered before and after the conduction of the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 at the COVID-19 vaccination center of the Palermo University Hospital (PUH). The baseline survey showed that 64% of community pharmacists (CPs) declared that they planned to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2, and 58% were vaccinated against influenza during the 2020/2021 season. Factors significantly associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination were confidence in vaccines (adjOR 1.76; CI 1.11-2.80), fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjOR 1.50; CI 1.06-2.11), considering COVID-19 vaccination to be the best strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 (adjOR 1.79; CI 1.39-2.29), and adherence to influenza vaccination during the 2020/2021 season (adjOR 3.25; CI 2.23-4.25). The adherence among CPs of the Palermo Province to COVID-19 vaccination was 96.5%. From the post-vaccination survey, the main reasons for changing opinions on vaccination adherence were the introduction of mandatory vaccinations, fear of contracting COVID-19, and limitations on work activities in the case of vaccine refusal. The achievement of very high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates among healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the present study was mainly due to the mandatory vaccination policies; nevertheless, a willingness for COVID-19 vaccination was relatively high among pharmacists before the beginning of the vaccination campaign. HCPs and CPs should receive training on vaccination, which is recommended in the national immunization plan and is also suggested by the respondents in our study, in order to routinely re-evaluate their own vaccination profiles, as well as those of their patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1543,35337757,"Economic impact of pharmaceutical services on polymedicated patients: A systematic review. BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is commonly related to poor drug adherence, decreased quality of life and inappropriate prescribing in eldery. Furthermore, this condition also leads to a higher utilization of health services resources, due to the increased risk of adverse drug events, length of stays in hospitals and readmissions rates after discharge. OBJECTIVE This Systematic Review aimed to synthesize the current evidence that evaluates pharmaceutical services on polymedicated patients, from an economic perspective. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, SCOPUS and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies that were published until January 2021. Experimental and observational studies were included in this review, using strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and were assessed for quality using the following tools: RoB and ROBINS-I. Two independent reviewers selected the articles and extracted the data. RESULTS 3,662 articles were retrieved from the databases. After the screening, 18 studies were included: 9 experimental and 9 observational studies. The studies reported that the integration of the pharmacist as a member of the healthcare team provides an optimized use of pharmacotherapy to polymedicated patients and contributes to health promotion, providing reduction of spending on medication, reduction of expenses related to emergency care and hospitalizations and other medical expenses. The ECRs made cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis, and most of the Non Randomized studies had statistically significant cost savings even considering the expenses of pharmaceutical assistance. Experimental studies reported a cost reduction varying between US$ 193 to US$ 4,966 per patient per year. Furthermore, observational studies estimated a cost reduction of varying from US$ 3 to US$ 2,505 per patient per year. The cost savings are related to decrease in emergency visits and hospitalizations, through pharmacist intervention (medication review and pharmacotherapy follow-up). CONCLUSIONS Considering the set of studies included, pharmaceutical care services directed to polymedicated patients may cooperate to save financial resources. Most of the interventions showed positive economic trends and also contributed to improving clinical parameters and quality of life. However, due to the majority of the studies having exploratory or qualitative methodology, it is essential to carry out more robust studies, based on full economic evaluation.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review of meta-analysis,,,Other,,,,Other,

BACKGROUND Pharmacists as the most accessible health professionals can serve as an important resource on medication safety for breastfeeding women. Previous research suggests that a barrier to pharmacists providing optimal pharmaceutical care for this population is a lack of knowledge. OBJECTIVE To evaluate pharmacist perceptions and barriers related to medication management of patients who are breastfeeding. METHODS A 25-question electronic survey was distributed via e-mail list servers to members of state pharmacy organizations. Pharmacists were queried on the importance of breastfeeding, barriers to pharmaceutical care, comfort level in making pharmacotherapy recommendations, adequacy of pharmacy school's curriculum, breastfeeding resources used, and need for continuing pharmacy education regarding medication use during breastfeeding. RESULTS Pharmacists from all geographic regions of the United States and diverse practice settings agreed to participate in the survey (N = 197). Most pharmacists reported feeling somewhat or extremely comfortable making recommendations and counseling breastfeeding patients on over-the-counter (102 of 187, 55%) and prescription medications (110 of 187, 59%). In contrast, 66% (123 of 187) reported feeling somewhat or extremely uncomfortable making recommendations and counseling on the use of herbal supplements in breastfeeding.

1546,35339394,"Moving forward: Implementing health psychology research to improve patient acceptance of biosimilars.  As more biosimilars enter the pharmaceutical market, patient acceptance remains a significant barrier to their uptake. Psychological factors, such as negative expectations, are important causes of patient hesitancy. As a result, patients can develop nocebo responses following a transition, discontinue biosimilar treatment early, or have poor adherence. These negative outcomes may offset some of the cost-saving potential of biosimilars. Key healthcare professionals such as pharmacists, physicians, and nurses already play a noteworthy role in educating and transitioning patients. However, given the psychological aspect of biosimilar acceptance, it is logical for healthcare professionals and researchers to draw on research and theory from health psychology. This commentary outlines how a multidisciplinary approach can add to the understanding of the mechanisms behind patient resistance to biosimilars and help engage patients in the transitioning process.

BACKGROUND Emotional intelligence (EI) can help perceive, understand, and manage emotions and positively impact performance in any profession, including pharmacists, and consequently may have positive influence on patient-related outcomes. Although there is strong body of evidence suggesting that developing EI in health professionals (HPs) can increase their capacity to successfully communicate and build relationships with patients, thus increasing patient satisfaction, little is known about it in pharmaceutical care (PhC). OBJECTIVES This review aimed to synthesize available data on the probable impact of EI on PhC. METHODS PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched for papers in English dated between January 2000 and June 2021. Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed method studies on EI and PhC that involved practicing pharmacists were included. RESULTS The inclusion criteria were met by 4 papers only. One reported positive impact of EI in reducing the negative correlation between autistic-like traits and empathy among hospital pharmacists. One study demonstrated that EI levels can be significantly enhanced through pharmacy leadership programs. Another study established a positive correlation between EI and entrepreneurial orientation in practicing community pharmacists. Higher EI scores were predictors of increased work innovation, proactivity, and risk-taking levels. One study reported comparative EI data between different HPs and found pharmacists' superiority in the EI subdomains of self-awareness, self-motivation, and social skills. CONCLUSION Additional research is required to provide evidence on how EI and EI development programs can add value to the provision of PhC.

Introduction Obesity has been reported to be linked with menstrual abnormalities including abnormality in cycle length, duration, and period blood loss. However, which anthropometric parameter is a better marker of menstrual abnormality is yet unknown. This study aims to explore the association of BMI, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-height ratio (WHtR) with menstrual abnormalities. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 240 nursing students on two nursing campuses of Nepal. Demographic and menstrual characteristics related data were collected from the participants via the face-to-face interview technique followed by anthropometric measurements. Binary logistic regression was used to study the association of BMI, WHR, and WHtR with menstrual characteristics. Univariable and multivariable regression models were calculated at 95% confidence interval and a P value of 0.05 using a Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM SPSS® v21 (IBM, Armonk, New York). Results Out of 240 participants, 52 participants (21.67%) were underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), and 47 participants (19.58%) were either overweight (≥23 kg/m2) or obese (≥25 kg/m2). Overweight and obese BMI was associated with abnormality in menstrual cycle length (AOR = 4.24; 95% CI = 1.77-10.17), duration of the menstrual period (AOR = 2.52; 95% CI = 1.09-5.81), and periodic menstrual blood loss (AOR = 9.04; 95% CI = 3.55-23.01). Increase in WHtR (>0.5) was associated with abnormal cycle length (AOR = 3.09; 95% CI = 1.09-8.80) and abnormal period duration (AOR = 3.05; 95% CI = 1.10-8.44). An increase in WHR (>0.8) was associated with abnormal cyclical menstrual blood loss (AOR = 4.93; 95% CI = 1.55-15.71). Conclusions Obesity predisposes to menstrual irregularities. BMI is a better predictor of menstrual irregularity as the increase in BMI is associated with abnormality in menstrual cycle length, period duration, and blood loss. Increased WHR was associated with periodic blood loss only. Increased WHtR was associated with abnormal cycle length and period duration, but not menstrual blood loss.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacists relied on their personal experience to resolve ethical dilemmas (n = 274, 70.3%), and when they seek advice, their work colleagues (n = 180, 46.4%) %), followed by the head of departments (144 n; 37.1%), were the main source of advice on ethical issues. The overall median knowledge score of pharmacists about data confidentiality was 2.0 out of 5.0 (IQR = 2.0). A considerable percentage of the pharmacists was willing to share information with family members without asking for permission from the patient (n = 98, 25.3%). Pharmacists had a median behavior score of 3.5 out of 4.0 (IQR = 0.4) regarding practices related to data confidentiality, where the majority of them handled medical information from the patient with great confidentiality (304 n, 78.4%), and 85.8% of them (n = 333) gave patient's sexual diseases-related medical information the highest confidentiality. However, based on univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis, none of the examined sociodemographic variables significantly predicted pharmacists' knowledge or behaviors (P > 0.05). Conclusion Pharmacists are aware of the importance of confidentiality issues of their patients. However, a number of gaps in their knowledge and practices of data confidentiality were identified. Training that targets these gaps in their knowledge, and rectifies incorrect practices is needed during university education and as part of their continuous medical education.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1551,35343261,"Antacids revisited: review on contemporary facts and relevance for self-management.  Heartburn and acid regurgitation are the typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Despite the availability of several treatment options, antacids remain the mainstay treatment for gastroesophageal reflux-related symptoms based on their efficacy, safety, and over-the-counter availability. Antacids are generally recommended for adults and children at least 12 years old, and the FDA recommends antacids as the first-line treatment for heartburn in pregnancy. This narrative review summarizes the mechanism, features, and limitations related to different antacid ingredients and techniques available to study the acid neutralization and buffering capacity of antacid formulations. Using supporting clinical evidence for different antacid ingredients, it also discusses the importance of antacids as OTC medicines and first-line therapies for heartburn, particularly in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which reliance on self-care has increased. The review will also assist pharmacists and other healthcare professionals in helping individuals with heartburn to make informed self-care decisions and educating them to ensure that antacids are used in an optimal, safe, and effective manner.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1552,35343287,"Long-Term Healthcare Cost Savings of a Pediatric Nephrotoxic Medication-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Reduction Program in a Simulated Sample. BACKGROUND Nephrotoxic medication exposure is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized children and is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The pharmacist-reliant NINJA program reduced nephrotoxic medication exposure and associated AKI. OBJECTIVES We assess potential healthcare cost savings from reduced CKD by preventing AKI with the NINJA program for a pediatric population through age 21. METHODS We simulated a cohort of 1000 hospitalized non-critically ill children. From the published literature, 310 develop AKI, 267 survive to 6 months, and 10-70% develop CKD, and NINJA implementation reduced AKI by 23.8%. Allowing for varying CKD rates, we estimated a range of NINJA's savings. We assumed an annual GFR decline of 1.2 (noHTN) ml/min/1.73 m2 for half the sample and 1.7 (HTN) ml/min/1.73 m2 for the other half to account for CKD progression without and with hypertension (HTN). We model attributable costs including CKD stage-related medications and outpatient visits/tests in 2018 dollars discounted at 3%. We subtract the cost of NINJA screening (daily serum creatinine and pharmacist time) from net savings. We exclude end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hospitalization costs. RESULTS No intervention estimated CKD related costs are $761,852 to $5,735,027. Post-NINJA cost decreases to $616,086 to $4,312,183 (net savings: $145,766 to $1,422 183). Total savings, accounting for NINJA screening ($256,680) are -$110,914 to $1,1 165 503. The breakeven AKI to CKD conversion rate is 13-14% with growth hormone cost included, and 64-65% without. CONCLUSION The NINJA program is likely cost beneficial, with greater savings into adulthood by avoiding/delaying ESRD and its costs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1553,35344192,"Best Evidence-Based Dosing Recommendations for Dexmedetomidine for Premedication and Procedural Sedation in Pediatrics: Outcome of a Risk-Benefit Analysis By the Dutch Pediatric Formulary. BACKGROUND Dexmedetomidine is currently off-label for use in pediatric clinical care worldwide. Nevertheless, it is frequently prescribed to pediatric patients as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia or for procedural sedation. There is ample literature on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in this vulnerable patient population, but there is a general lack of consensus on dosing. In this project, we aimed to use the standardized workflow of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to establish best evidence-based pediatric dosing guidelines for dexmedetomidine as premedication and for procedural sedation. METHOD The available literature on dexmedetomidine in pediatrics was reviewed in order to address the following three questions: (1) What is the right dose? (2) What is known about efficacy? (3) What is known about safety? Relevant literature was compiled into a risk-benefit analysis document. A team of clinical experts critically appraised the analysis and the proposed dosing recommendations. RESULTS Dexmedetomidine is most commonly administered via the intravenous or intranasal route. Clearance is age dependent, warranting higher doses in infants to reach similar exposure as in adults. Dexmedetomidine use results in satisfactory sedation at parent separation, adequate sedation and a favorable recovery profile. The safety profile is good and comparable to adults, with dose-related hemodynamic effects. CONCLUSION Following the structured approach of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary, best evidence-based dosing recommendations were proposed for dexmedetomidine, used as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia (intranasal dose) and for procedural sedation (intranasal and intravenous dose) in pediatric patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND There is controversy over whether non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) use increase the risk of hepatic impairment in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). We conducted a comprehensive assessment using multi-source medical data. METHODS We first performed a systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases (through 11 August 2021) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies (RWSs) that reported hepatic impairment events in patients with NVAF administered NOACs or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) therapy. The primary outcomes were hepatic impairment identified by diagnostic liver injury (DLI) or abnormal liver enzyme (ALE). The secondary outcome was hepatic failure. Relative risks (RRs) for RCTs and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for RWSs were calculated separately using random-effects models. We also conducted a disproportionality analysis by extracting reports of hepatic impairment associated with NOACs from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) were calculated to identify the statistical associations between NOACs and hepatic impairment. Scenario analyses were further performed to eliminate event- and drug-related competition bias. RESULTS A total of 559,873 patients from five RCTs and four RWSs were included in the pooled analysis. For RCTs, NOACs use was not associated with an increased risk of DLI (RR: 0.96, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.73-1.28) or ALE (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.69-1.19) compared with VKAs. The merged results of RWSs also showed a similar risk of DLI (aHR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.72-1.09) or ALE (aHR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.82-1.00) between NOACs and VKAs. The results of hepatic failure were in accordance with the primacy outcomes. Analyses of individual NOACs did not significantly affect the results. Insights from the FAERS database failed to detect hepatic impairment signals for overall NOACs agents (ROR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.32-0.37). Scenario analyses confirmed the primary results. CONCLUSIONS Insights from multi-source medical data confirmed that NOACs use was not associated with an increased risk of hepatic impairment in patients with NVAF.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1555,35346050,"Information exchange networks for chronic diseases in primary care practices in Germany: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Coordination of care requires information exchange between health workers. The structure of their information exchange networks may influence the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021. As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of connections, density and centralization for each of the health conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in primary care practices. RESULTS We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25 practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17 for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members. Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with nurses and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS This study identified four types of information exchange structures, which provides a practical tool for management and improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer connections and could hardly be considered a network.

BACKGROUND While international guidelines recommend medication reviews as part of the management of multimorbidity, evidence on how to implement reviews in practice in primary care is lacking. The MultimorbiditY Collaborative Medication Review And Decision Making (MyComrade) intervention is an evidence-based, theoretically informed novel intervention which aims to support the conduct of medication reviews for patients with multimorbidity in primary care. Our aim in this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a trial of the intervention with unique modifications accounting for contextual variations in two neighbouring health systems (Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI)). METHODS A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted, using a mixed-methods process evaluation to investigate the feasibility of a trial of the MyComrade intervention based on pre-defined progression criteria. A total of 16 practices will be recruited (eight in ROI; eight in NI), and four practices in each jurisdiction will be randomly allocated to intervention or control. Twenty people living with multimorbidity and prescribed ≥ 10 repeat medications will be recruited from each practice prior to practice randomisation. In intervention practices, the MyComrade intervention will be delivered by pairs of general practitioners (GPs) in ROI, and a GP and practice-based pharmacist (PBP) in NI. The GPs/GP and PBP will schedule the time to review the medications together using a checklist. Usual care will proceed in practices in the control arm. Data will be collected via electronic health records and postal questionnaires at recruitment and 4 and 8 months after randomisation. Qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and explore experiences related to multimorbidity management will be conducted with a purposive sample of GPs, PBPs, practice administration staff and patients in intervention and control practices. The feasibility of conducting a health economic evaluation as part of a future definitive trial will be assessed. DISCUSSION The findings of this pilot study will assess the feasibility of a trial of the MyComrade intervention in two different health systems. Evaluation of the progression criteria will guide the decision to progress to a definitive trial and inform trial design. The findings will also contribute to the growing evidence-base related to intervention development and feasibility studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN80017020 .

1557,35346393,"CENTER-IT: a novel methodology for adapting multi-level interventions using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research-a case example of a school-supervised asthma intervention. BACKGROUND Implementation science frameworks advise the engagement of multi-level partners (at the patient, provider, and systems level) to adapt and increase the uptake of evidence-based practices (EBPs). However, there is little guidance to ensure that systems-level adaptations reflect the voices of providers who deliver and patients/caregivers who receive EBPs. METHODS We present a novel methodology, grounded in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), which anchors the engagement of multi-level partners to the voices of individuals who deliver and receive EBPs. Using the CFIR domains: intervention adaptation, individuals involved, inner/outer setting, and process, we illustrate our 4-step methodology through a case example of Asthma Link, a school-supervised asthma management intervention. In step 1, we interviewed ""individuals involved"" in the intervention (providers/caregivers/patients of Asthma Link) to identify implementation barriers. In step 2, we selected systems-level partners in the ""inner and outer setting"" that could assist with addressing these barriers. In step 3, we presented the barriers to these systems-level partners and conducted semi-structured interviews to elicit their recommended solutions (process). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and open-coded. A theoretical sampling model and deductive reasoning were used to identify solutions to implementation barriers. In step 4, we utilized multi-level input to adapt the Asthma Link intervention. RESULTS Identified barriers included inability to obtain two inhalers for home and school use, inconsistent delivery of the inhaler to school by families, and challenges when schools did not have a nurse. Interviews conducted with school/clinic leaders, pharmacists, payors, legislators, and policymakers (n=22) elicited solutions to address provider and patient/caregiver-identified barriers, including (1) establishing a Medicaid-specific pharmacy policy to allow dispensation of two inhalers, (2) utilizing pharmacy-school delivery services to ensure medication reaches schools, and (3) identifying alternate (non-nurse) officials to supervise medication administration. The iterative process of engaging multi-level partners helped to create an adapted Asthma Link intervention, primed for effective implementation. CONCLUSIONS This novel methodology, grounded in the CFIR, ensures that systems-level changes that require the engagement of multi-level partners reflect the voices of individuals who deliver and receive EBPs. This methodology demonstrates the dynamic interplay of CFIR domains to advance the field of implementation science.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1558,35346606,"The physician perspective on pharmacist-physician collaboration and trust. BACKGROUND Health care has shifted to focus less on individual practitioners and more on providing interprofessional and collaborative patient care. A strong working relationship among pharmacists and physicians is imperative for patient care and safety. OBJECTIVES The objective of this research was to examine physician perspectives of the relationship between physicians and pharmacists, specifically evaluating the qualities and actions necessary for pharmacists to establish trust to provide the best quality of patient care. METHODS Semistructured qualitative key informant interviews were conducted with 11 physicians. Questions were designed to gather information about the physicians' experiences with pharmacists and perceived barriers and opportunities for building trust and collaboration. The Unified Theory of Trust and Collaboration was used as a theoretical framework. RESULTS The ability to cooperate was the most important aspect identified by all 11 physicians in creating effective collaboration along with respect, knowledge, communication, and trust. Common barriers identified with the pharmacist-physician relationship were the lack of identity, rapport, knowledge, positive attitude, and communication. CONCLUSION Building trust and narrowing the gaps of communication are crucial in achieving effective collaborative practice among health professionals. Pharmacists and physicians must have the capability to cooperate with one another, understand the common moral responsibility they share, recognize the implications of their personal behavior on their professional relationships, and focus on their scope of practice without crossing boundaries. Through positive behaviors of civility, communication, adaption, and mutual respect in their individual roles, pharmacists and physicians can enhance their relationship and practice collaboratively.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This study systematically sorted out the evidence data of the safety, effectiveness, economy, innovation, suitability, accessibility, and characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) of Reyanning Mixture in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection(heat-toxin attacking lung syndrome) with the qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods adopted. Based on evidence-based medicine, epidemiology, clinical medicine, evidence-based pharmacy, pharmacoeconomics, and health technology evalua-tion(HTA), the clinical value of Reyanning Mixture was evaluated using multi-criteria decision analysis(MCDA) model, Chinese patent medicine clinical evidence, and value evaluation software(CSC v2.0). The SRS monitoring data, Meta-analysis, and other safety evidence showed that the main adverse reactions of Reyanning Mixture were nausea, diarrhea, and rash, and no serious adverse reactions were found. The pharmacovigilance system was sound, and the system was perfect. There was no recall, notification, or interview for unqualified products. Based on the existing research, the evidence was sufficient, and the risk was controllable. Hence, its safety was grade A. Meta-analysis showed that in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection, Reyanning Mixture combined with Amoxicillin Capsules was better than Amoxicillin Capsules alone in shortening the complete fever relief time and improving the cure rate. Besides, it was superior to Shuanghuanglian Granules in shortening the complete fever relief time, cough relief time, nasal congestion relief time, and pharyngeal congestion relief time. The Meta-analysis was conducted based on AMSTAR standard, and its ove-rall quality was proved good. The evidence quality in GRADE system evaluation was medium and low. The quality of evidence was medium, and the clinical value was obvious. Hence, its effectiveness was grade A. The results of pharmacoeconomic research showed that compared with Amoxicillin Capsules, Reyanning Mixture alone or in combination with Amoxicillin Capsules had cost-effectiveness advantages in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection, and the results were stable in sensitivity analysis. According to the CASP economic evaluation checklist, the research problems were clear and the results were reliable. As revealed by the comprehensive evaluation, the evidence quality was sufficient and the result was clear. Its economy was grade B. Reyanning Mixture had multiple therapeutic targets like anti-virus, anti-bacteria, antipyresis, and anti-cough, with good clinical innovation. There were many innovative initiatives in ensuring drug supply, especially at the grass roots, drug safety, and effectiveness, and also multiple innovative contributions to production technology, quality control, scientific and technological research and development, and enterprise management and marketing. Therefore, its innovation was grade B. The dosage form of Reyanning was mixture, which made it convenient for storage and transportation. The usage was easy to be mastered and accepted by doctors and nurses, exhibiting good suitability for clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients who received this drug and basically meeting the needs of clinical medication. The suitability was grade B. The average daily cost of this drug was 8.082 yuan, and the price was low. The treatment cost accounted for a small proportion of the annual disposable income of urban and rural residents, indicating that it was affordable. Reyanning Mixture was available in 31 provinces, cities and autonomous regions, covering 6 910 hospitals. The allocation of hospitals at all levels was more than 50%. There was no shortage or supply restriction of medicinal material resources. The annual production capacity was sufficient to meet the supply demand, so its accessibility was grade A. Reyanning Mixture, sourced from &quot;pneumonia Ⅲ&quot;, has been subjected to a real-world study of its clinical application, with 4 367 cases involved, and the characteristic of TCM was grade B.

1560,35348582,"AFSE: towards improving model generalization of deep graph learning of ligand bioactivities targeting GPCR proteins.  Ligand molecules naturally constitute a graph structure. Recently, many excellent deep graph learning (DGL) methods have been proposed and used to model ligand bioactivities, which is critical for the virtual screening of drug hits from compound databases in interest. However, pharmacists can find that these well-trained DGL models usually are hard to achieve satisfying performance in real scenarios for virtual screening of drug candidates. The main challenges involve that the datasets for training models were small-sized and biased, and the inner active cliff cases would worsen model performance. These challenges would cause predictors to overfit the training data and have poor generalization in real virtual screening scenarios. Thus, we proposed a novel algorithm named adversarial feature subspace enhancement (AFSE). AFSE dynamically generates abundant representations in new feature subspace via bi-directional adversarial learning, and then minimizes the maximum loss of molecular divergence and bioactivity to ensure local smoothness of model outputs and significantly enhance the generalization of DGL models in predicting ligand bioactivities. Benchmark tests were implemented on seven state-of-the-art open-source DGL models with the potential of modeling ligand bioactivities, and precisely evaluated by multiple criteria. The results indicate that, on almost all 33 GPCRs datasets and seven DGL models, AFSE greatly improved their enhancement factor (top-10%, 20% and 30%), which is the most important evaluation in virtual screening of hits from compound databases, while ensuring the superior performance on RMSE and $r^2$.

PURPOSE To evaluate the impact of a bariatric clinic-based pharmacist on inpatient length of stay, medication errors, and patient experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study comparing patients who received a pre-operative pharmacist consultation to historical cases without pre-operative pharmacist consultation prior to admission for bariatric surgery. A patient experience survey was administered post-operatively to the intervention group. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included corrected medication errors on reconciliation, pharmacist interventions, adverse drug event (ADE) prevention, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS With 68 patients in the intervention group and 67 patients in the control group, the majority were female (76%) and received either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (53%) or sleeve gastrectomy (47%). The median LOS in the intervention group was 55.5 h, which did not significantly differ from the median 57.9 h in the control group (p = 0.56). The clinic-based pharmacist made an average of 13 interventions per patient. Surveys were distributed to 73 patients with a 60% response rate. High overall satisfaction with the pre-operative pharmacist consultation was reported by 97% of patients. CONCLUSION Although hospital LOS did not significantly differ between groups, pre-operative pharmacist consultation prevented potential ADEs, and provided strong patient satisfaction.

INTRODUCTION The implementation of new drug safety information and Direct Healthcare Professional Communications (DHPCs) in hospitals is important for patient safety. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to gain insight into which procedures and practices are in place to handle new drug safety information and particularly DHPCs in the Dutch hospital setting. METHODS We first conducted focus groups including medical specialists and hospital pharmacists, focusing on handling of drug safety information at the individual and organisational level. A survey was then developed and distributed among hospital pharmacists in all Dutch hospitals to quantify the existence of specific procedures and committees to handle drug safety information and DHPCs. RESULTS Eleven specialists and 14 pharmacists from six hospitals participated in focus groups. Drug safety information was usually considered before drugs were included in formularies or treatment protocols. Furthermore, drug safety information was consulted in response to patients experiencing adverse events. DHPCs were mostly dealt with by individual professionals. DHPCs could lead to actions but this was very uncommon. Completed surveys were received from 40 (53%) of the hospitals. In 32 (80%), the hospital pharmacy had procedures to deal with new drug safety information, whereas in 11 (28%) a hospital-wide procedure was in place. Drug safety was considered in committees concerning drug formulary decisions (69%) and antibiotic policies (63%). DHPCs were assessed by a hospital pharmacist in 50% of the hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Drug safety information was used for evaluation of new treatments and in response to adverse events.

WHO supports the harnessing of mobile technologies to improve access to smoking cessation services. As such, this study evaluated the effectiveness of smoking cessation services provided by community pharmacists using PharmQuit compared with standard care. The study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that included 156 participants who were 18 years or older and smoked at least one cigarette daily for a month, were ready to quit, willing to participate, and had a smartphone. The study was performed at seven community pharmacies in three provinces in Thailand. Participants were allocated to the intervention (n = 78) and control groups (n = 78). Both groups received the usual smoking cessation services with pharmacotherapy and counseling from community pharmacists for 6 months. The intervention group received PharmQuit as an additional service. Both groups were scheduled for follow-up visits on days 7, 14, 30, 60, 120, and 180. The primary outcome was continuous abstinence rate on day 180. The secondary outcomes included 7-day point abstinence rate, number of cigarettes smoked per day, exhaled carbon monoxide levels, adherence rate to the program, and satisfaction with PharmQuit. An analysis using the intent-to-treat principle was performed. Smoking cessation rates and the number of cigarettes smoked per day were significantly higher during the follow-up visits in both groups (p < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The adherence rate to the smoking cessation program was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (74 days vs. 60 days, p > 0.05). The results showed the benefits of the contribution of community pharmacists. Although the inclusion of PharmQuit did not yield better results than pharmacists' counselling alone, it may help obtain better adherence to smoking cessation programs.

OBJECTIVE Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that requires complex, lifelong treatment regimens to maintain health and reduce disease progression. The aims of this study were 1) to gain the perspectives of multiple health professions to understand medication and well-being challenges of people living with CF; and 2) to apply the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to further identify opportunities for pharmacists to support people with CF. METHODS Health care professionals were recruited from a Cystic Fibrosis Center in the Midwest, to participate in audio-recorded semistructured interviews. Topics examined during the interviews included medication education for patients as well as experiences with outpatient, specialty, and community pharmacists. The themes assessed during the pharmacist interviews included support for people living with CF, preferences in conducting medication education, and pharmacist-specific counseling. Interview transcripts were thematically analyzed into categories to determine major themes. Prevalent codes were categorized into 5 major themes guided by the SEIPS model. Interrater reliability was strong (kappa = 0.94). RESULTS Five major themes were identified: 1) patient tasks; 2) external environment; 3) organizational conditions; 4) patient medication education; and 5) pharmacists' roles and tasks.

1566,35350470,"Bridging Allied Health Professional Roles to Improve Patient Outcomes in Rural and Remote Australia: A Descriptive Qualitative Study. Purpose Australia's rural and remote populations experience inequality of access to healthcare, with demand exceeding capacity for delivery of health services, often due to a maldistribution of the health workforce. A strategy which may overcome barriers to accessing adequate healthcare includes implementation of interdisciplinary collaborative teams, identified as a successful method of healthcare delivery. This study thus aimed to explore interdisciplinary allied health collaborative practice in a rural community. Methods Role theory, as a philosophical perspective, was used to explore role perceptions and the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration between pharmacists and allied health professionals including dieticians/public health nutritionists, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists, by conducting 29 interviews in a rural community. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and categorised into emerging themes. Results Five constructs of role theory were used to describe the data: role identity, role overload, role sufficiency, role conflict, and role ambiguity. Participants identified as rural generalists and health promoters, who work within innovative and adaptive healthcare settings. Role overload was reported as considerable due to high demand for services and a lack of resources in rural and remote regions, resulting in poor role sufficiency. Overall, there was a low level of role conflict, and participants were highly in favor of interprofessional collaboration; however, uncertainty of the pharmacist's role (role ambiguity) was a major barrier identified. Health professionals with more years in practice provided few examples of how they would utilise a pharmacist in their practice, although these gave valuable insight into the potential integration of a pharmacist into an interdisciplinary health team, with allied health professionals. Conclusion This study has applied role theory providing a greater understanding of the enablers and barriers of pharmacists working within interdisciplinary allied health teams and highlighting opportunities to bridge interprofessional roles to improve patient outcomes, especially in rural and remote communities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1567,35351117,"Views, knowledge, and practices of hospital pharmacists about using clinical pharmacokinetics to optimize pharmaceutical care services: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Pharmacokinetics (PK) is often used to optimize individualized dosing regimens of some drugs. This study was conducted to determine views, knowledge, and practices of hospital pharmacists in Palestine about using clinical PK to optimize pharmaceutical care services. METHOD This study was conducted in a cross-sectional design using a questionnaire. The questionnaire collected information about the nature of PK courses taught to hospital pharmacists, importance, relevance, effectiveness, adequacy, and depth of these courses, adequacy of PK skills, implementing PK knowledge/skills in current practice, and barriers limiting the implementation of PK to optimize pharmaceutical care services for hospitalized patients. The hospital pharmacists were visited in their places of work and were asked to complete the questionnaire in privacy. Categorical data were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 145 hospital pharmacists. Of the pharmacists, 84 (57.9%) received basic PK courses, 79 (54.5%) were taught integrated PK courses, and 94 (64.8%) agreed that the PK courses were important to their current practice. Similarly, 85 (57.9%) of the pharmacists were not satisfied with the teaching methods and contents of the PK courses. Pharmacists who obtained their degrees from Palestine were less satisfied with the methods of teaching compared to those who obtained their degrees from foreign countries (p-value = 0.006). Only 25 (17.2%) pharmacists reported frequent use of PK knowledge in their current practice. Lack of practical knowledge and continuing education, poor understanding of PK by pharmacists and other healthcare professionals were identified as barriers limiting the implementation of PK in optimizing pharmaceutical care services to hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION The hospital pharmacists were generally not satisfied with the way PK courses were taught and expressed difficulty in implementing PK knowledge and skills to improve pharmaceutical care services to hospitalized patients. Integrating PK topics within other relevant courses and adopting more clinically oriented learning methods could improve understanding and implementing PK knowledge and skills in optimizing pharmaceutical services to hospitalized patients. Further studies are still needed to determine the optimal teaching/learning methods that can improve knowledge and skill acquisitions of pharmacists in the area of PK.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1568,35351121,"Impact of proton pump inhibitor management committee's multifaceted interventions on acid suppressant prescribing patterns in outpatient and emergency departments. BACKGROUND A nationwide campaign for rational proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use launched in 2015 had a positive impact for hospitalized patients PPI use. But there were few studies focusing on the rational use of PPIs in outpatients. In 2018, the PPI management committee conducted a year-long intervention on the appropriate use of PPIs in outpatient and emergency departments, including clinical pharmacist interventions and stewardship interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the PPI management committee's multifaceted interventions by comparing the real-world acid suppressant prescribing patterns for outpatients before (2017) and after intervention (2019) at a Chinese tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS Prescriptions containing any acid suppressant in outpatient and emergency departments in baseline (2017) and postintervention (2019) periods were extracted from the hospital information system and the prescription automatic screening system. Acid suppressant prescribing patterns were evaluated based on primary diagnoses and patient demographics. The prescribed acid suppressants stratified using age groups (< 7, 7-17, 18-45, 46-65, 66-85 and > 85 years) were also examined. RESULT The utilization rate of acid suppressant in 2017 and 2019 was 2.5% (41,165/1,619,366) and 2.2% (49,550/2,236,471), respectively (P < 0.0001). 60,135 acid suppressant prescriptions were obtained in 2017 and 73,275 in 2019. The rate of acid suppressant prescriptions for the approved indications significantly increased from 62.6% (2017) to 65.4% (2019) (P < 0.0001). Prescriptions diagnosed as abnormal symptoms, signs and clinical manifestations, decreased in 2019 (13.0% vs. 16.5%, P < 0.0001). The most frequently prescribed PPIs differed between 2017 and 2019 (rabeprazole 2017 vs. esomeprazole 2019). Omeprazole was the most common PPI and cimetidine was the most common H2RA prescribed to patients aged < 18 years in 2017 and 2019. A total of CNY11.83 million was spent on acid suppressants in 2019, accounting for about 48.7% of total medication cost, increased by 11.3% from 2017 (37.4%). CONCLUSION The proportion of acid suppressant prescriptions for approved indications was enhanced after the PPI management committee's multifaceted interventions, but there were still some problems in the selection of acid suppressants.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1569,35351326,"Patients experience and perceived concerns regarding obtaining and taking prescriptions for head and neck osteoradionecrosis.  The main components of the medical management of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) are combinations of clodronate, pentoxifylline, tocopherol, sometimes with antibiotics or chlorhexidine rinses. Anecdotally in the Cheshire and Merseyside network, patients report having difficulties getting and taking their prescription, hence the aim was to survey patient experience of obtaining prescriptions, administration of the medications, and side effects. Patients prescribed tocopherol and pentoxifylline from the pharmacy department's record database from the period of January 2019 to June 2020 were invited to take part in a semi-structured telephone survey. Sixteen patients out of a total 33 (48%) responded. 11 patients (69%) reported some issue collecting their repeat prescriptions, commonly low stock of medicines in community or unwillingness of GPs to prescribe. One patient permanently stopped treatment owing to difficulties obtaining medication, whilst for three there were temporary gaps in treatment. Difficulty in administration of the medications was reported in 7 patients (44%) patients, most commonly in those with pre-existing dysphagia. Issues related to difficulties in swallowing the large pentoxifylline tablet or with the vitamin E capsules. Patients crushed the medications, but this was associated with gastrointestinal side-effects in one patient who had to stop treatment. One patient stopped chlorhexidine mouthwash due to oral soreness. In conclusion, medical management of ORN is well tolerated by patients. There is difficulty for patients getting prescriptions in primary care. Few patients need to stop taking the medication due to difficulty in administration or side-effects. More patient information would be useful for all concerned.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1570,35351354,"Trends in Emergency Contraceptive Use Among Adolescents and Young Adults, 2006-2017. PURPOSE In 2013, age restrictions for adolescents on over-the-counter access were removed for ""Plan B One-Step"", a single oral medication option for emergency contraception use. Restrictions on generic options of the emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) were removed in 2014. METHODS National Survey of Family Growth data were used to assess the prevalence of ever use of ECPs among sexually experienced female adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 15-24 years (2015-2017 sample), and trends in indicators of ECP use and acquisition (2006-2017 samples). Prevalence estimates were obtained by age subgroups for 15-17, 18-19, and 20-24 years. Statistical significance was determined using an alpha of .05 and 95% confidence intervals calculated around the point estimates. RESULTS The weighted estimate of sexually experienced female AYA in the United States ranged from 13.3 million in 2006-2008 to 12.7 million in 2015-2017. The prevalence of ever ECP use was 18.2% (95% CI 15.7-21.1) and 31.8% (95% CI 26.9-37.1) in 2006-2008 and 2015-2017, respectively. Ever use in 2015-2017 varied by age group, number of lifetime opposite-sex partners and abortions, and experience of nonconsensual sex. In 2008-2010, 46.1% (95% CI 36.0-56.5) of respondents last obtained ECPs at community health or family planning clinics, and 31.8% (95% CI 22.9-42.2) last obtained ECPs at a pharmacy compared to 18.1% (95% CI 12.0-26.4) and 70.1% (95% CI 60.6-78.1) respectively in 2015-2017. Prevalence of provider counseling about emergency contraception in female AYA regardless of prior sexual experience in the past 12 months remained at or below 5% from 2006 to 2017. CONCLUSION Increasing access to ECPs over-the-counter may have contributed to notable increases in reported ever use of ECPs and in the receipts from a pharmacy among AYA between 2006 and 2017. AYA may benefit if pharmacists and healthcare providers increase reproductive health counseling.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1571,35351709,"Barriers and facilitators of successful deprescribing as described by older patients living with frailty, their informal carers and clinicians: a qualitative interview study. OBJECTIVE To explore the barriers/facilitators to deprescribing in primary care in England from the perspectives of clinicians, patients living with frailty who reside at home, and their informal carers, drawing on the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify behavioural components associated with barriers/facilitators of the process. DESIGN Exploratory qualitative study. SETTING General practice (primary care) in England. PARTICIPANTS 9 patients aged 65+ living with frailty who attended a consultation to reduce or stop a medicine/s. 3 informal carers of patients living with frailty. 14 primary care clinicians including general practitioners, practice pharmacists and advanced nurse practitioners. METHODS Qualitative semistructured interviews took place with patients living with frailty, their informal carers and clinicians. Patients (n=9) and informal carers (n=3) were interviewed two times: immediately after deprescribing and 5/6 weeks later. Clinicians (n=14) were interviewed once. In total, 38 interviews were undertaken. Framework analysis was applied to manage and analyse the data. RESULTS 6 themes associated with facilitators and barriers to deprescribing were generated, respectively, with each supported by between two and three subthemes. Identified facilitators of deprescribing with patients living with frailty included shared decision-making, gradual introduction of the topic, clear communication of the topic to the patient and multidisciplinary working. Identified barriers of deprescribing included consultation constraints, patients' fear of negative consequences and inaccessible terminology and information. CONCLUSIONS This paper offers timely insight into the barriers and facilitators to deprescribing for patients living with frailty within the context of primary care in England. As deprescribing continues to grow in national and international significance, it is important that future deprescribing interventions acknowledge the current barriers and facilitators and their associated behavioural components experienced by clinicians, patients living with frailty and their informal carers to improve the safety and effectiveness of the process.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1572,35351797,"A Survey of Pandemic Impacts on Pharmacy Residency Applications, Interviews, and Selection Factors.  Objective. To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmacy residency application/interview processes, match rate, and factors influencing match rankings at a single college of pharmacyMethods. In Spring of 2020 and 2021, an anonymous survey of professional year four (PY4) residency applicants at one college of pharmacy was administered. Survey responses were compared to explore trends in showcase participation, number/type/geographic dispersion of applications submitted, interview invitations, grade point average (GPA), research experience, and match rate. A thematic analysis evaluated common factors influencing match rankings.Results. Responses were collected from 75 of 99 (75.8%) residency-seeking students in 2020 and 79 of 94 (84.0%) in 2021. Students in 2021 reported applying to a higher median number of programs, with no significant differences in mean reported number of interview invitations or match rate. The virtual ASHP Midyear Showcase led to a median reported savings of $1,000 with no significant impact on perceived value. Virtual interviews led to a median reported savings of $430. Thematic analysis revealed feel/culture, location, and learning experience options as the most prevalent deciding factors for match rankings in both years.Conclusion. The pandemic led to an increase in the number of residency applications per student and yielded a net cost savings. There were no differences in number of interviews offered, match rate, or in deciding factors influencing match rankings. As the pandemic evolves, schools should maintain a flexible and dynamic approach to support students.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1573,35351798,"The Need for Quality Assessment of Entrustable Professional Activities in Pharmacy Education.  Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are specific tasks that a professional is entrusted to perform autonomously and, together, define the scope of a profession. There are specific attributes that a task must possess both structurally and conceptually to be classified as an EPA. A high-quality EPA must be an observable, measurable, and professional task that requires training to execute, is fit for entrustment, and can be performed independently. In 2017, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) defined 15 Core EPAs expected of a pharmacy learner upon graduation (Core EPAs). Despite acceptance and implementation by pharmacy schools across the country, the Core EPAs have not been evaluated using an objective assessment tool to ensure that they meet specific EPA quality standards outlined in the literature.

BACKGROUND Chronic pain is prevalent and costly; cost-effective nonpharmacological approaches that reduce pain and improve patient functioning are needed. OBJECTIVE Report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with usual care, of cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at improving functioning and pain among patients with chronic pain on long-term opioid treatment. DESIGN Economic evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic cluster randomized trial. SUBJECTS Adults with chronic pain on long-term opioid treatment (N=814). INTERVENTION A cognitive behavioral therapy intervention teaching pain self-management skills in 12 weekly, 90-minute groups delivered by an interdisciplinary team (behaviorists, nurses) with additional support from physical therapists, and pharmacists. OUTCOME MEASURES Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost per additional responder (≥30% improvement on standard scale assessment of Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity, and Sleep). Costs were estimated as-delivered, and replication. RESULTS Per patient intervention replication costs were $2145 ($2574 as-delivered). Those costs were completely offset by lower medical care costs; inclusive of the intervention, total medical care over follow-up was $1841 lower for intervention patients. Intervention group patients also had greater QALY and responder gains than did controls. Supplemental analyses using pain-related medical care costs revealed ICERs of $35,000, and $53,000 per QALY (for replication, and as-delivered intervention costs, respectively); the ICER when excluding patients with outlier follow-up costs was $106,000. LIMITATIONS Limited to 1-year follow-up; identification of pain-related utilization potentially incomplete. CONCLUSION The intervention was the optimal choice at commonly accepted levels of willingness-to-pay for QALY gains; this finding was robust to sensitivity analyses.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1576,35353042,"Understanding Engagement and the Potential Impact of an Electronic Drug Repository: Multi-Methods Study. BACKGROUND Centralized drug repositories can reduce adverse events and inappropriate prescriptions by enabling access to dispensed medication data at the point of care; however, how they achieve this goal is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE This study aims to understand the perceived clinical value; the barriers to and enablers of adoption; and the clinician groups for which a provincial, centralized drug repository may provide the most benefit. METHODS A mixed methods approach, including a web-based survey and semistructured interviews, was used. Participants were clinicians (eg, nurses, physicians, and pharmacists) in Ontario who were eligible to use the digital health drug repository (DHDR), irrespective of actual use. Survey data were ranked on a 7-point adjectival scale and analyzed using descriptive statistics, and interviews were analyzed using qualitative descriptions. RESULTS Of the 161 survey respondents, only 40 (24.8%) actively used the DHDR. Perceptions of the utility of the DHDR were neutral (mean scores ranged from 4.11 to 4.76). Of the 75.2% (121/161) who did not use the DHDR, 97.5% (118/121) rated access to medication information (eg, dose, strength, and frequency) as important. Reasons for not using the DHDR included the cumbersome access process and the perception that available data were incomplete or inaccurate. Of the 33 interviews completed, 26 (79%) were active DHDR users. The DHDR was a satisfactory source of secondary information; however, the absence of medication instructions and prescribed medications (which were not dispensed) limited its ability to provide a comprehensive profile to meaningfully support clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS Digital drug repositories must be adjusted to align with the clinician's needs to provide value. Ensuring integration with point-of-care systems, comprehensive clinical data, and streamlined onboarding processes would optimize clinically meaningful use. The electronic provision of accessible drug information to providers across health care settings has the potential to improve efficiency and reduce medication errors.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical pharmacists are encouraged to participate in falls prevention programs in many healthcare facilities. A uniform methodology for the work of clinical pharmacist in fall prevention has not yet been established in the Czech Republic. The aim of this work is to offer the methodology based on our own data analysis. Retrospective clinical pharmacist&#39;s output analysis was performed in two areas: fall&#39;s pharmacoprevention and post-fall drug audits. In the results 78 % of patients who fell during hospitalization were over 65 years of age. Age was subsequently taken as the basic criterion for the patient&#39;s medication evaluation with regard to the risk of falling. Thanks to the widespread expansion of clinical pharmaceutical care and the newly introduced fall prevention and monitoring system at ÚVN Prague, there was a positive trend in the incidence of medication&#39;s adverse effects on patient&#39;s falls: in 2017 it was 34 % of cases, in 2020 only 13 %. Based on our data and experience, we offer a methodology for the clinical pharmacist&#39;s activity in fall prevention: 1. performing revision of medication also with regard to the risk of falls in patients over 65 years of age, 2. ensuring the automatic requests sending to the clinical pharmacy department in the case of a patient&#39;s fall in a medical facility.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate NJ pharmacists' perceptions on the safety and potential consequences of performing COVID-19 testing within their community pharmacy practice sites. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to NJ-registered pharmacists approximately 3 months after the administrative order was issued. RESULTS The survey was completed by 523 recipients (3.39% response rate) and responses from 311 NJ pharmacists practicing in community pharmacy were analyzed. The majority of respondents (83.8%) were not providing testing, while 16.2% were testing at the time of survey distribution. Most testing pharmacists were staff pharmacists with one to five years of experience, working in a pharmacy chain approximately 30-40 hours per week. Those not testing identified lack of a pharmacy drive-through, insufficient staff, and potential workflow disruption as reasons for not testing. Increased workload and fear of spreading the virus to others were concerns noted by both testers and non-testers.

Their significant value has been further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. OBJECTIVES To identify and categorize potential barriers and facilitators to the role of community pharmacists during the pandemic and their association with demographic factors. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of community pharmacists was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire during April 2020 across all regions of Egypt. KEY FINDINGS Respondents (n = 1018; 98.4% response rate) revealed practical and psychological barriers, including inadequate levels of pandemic preparedness (mean 61.43%; ±SD 0.47), inadequate working environments (mean 56.23%; ±SD 0.49) and uncooperative behaviour from stakeholders (mean 65.3%; ±SD 0.47).The majority of respondents emphasized the universal, region-independent necessity for facilitators, including the availability of timely (94.9%) guidance (97.4%) published by the Egyptian healthcare authority (94.6%), in electronic format (82.1%), through smartphone application (80.0%) and the provision of a dedicated telephone hotline (89.5%). Furthermore, authorities must use the media to manage public perceptions (97.2%) and increase public trust (94.8%) towards the pharmacist. CONCLUSIONS The barriers and facilitators identified herein could improve service provision in an integrated manner by overcoming the reported inadequate level of preparedness (barrier) through the provision of electronic guidance (facilitator), and the use of the media in managing public perceptions and trust (facilitators) to reduce the panic that negatively affects the working environment (barrier) for pharmacy staff.

1587,35359861,"Exploring Pakistani Physicians' Knowledge and Practices Regarding High Alert Medications: Findings and Implications.  Introduction: While many low-middle income countries (LMICs), including Pakistan, try and ensure patient safety within available resources, there are considerable concerns with medication use. Unsafe and inappropriate medication use, especially high alert medications (HAMs), is one of the important factors compromising patient safety and quality of care. Besides economic loss, HAMs contribute to greater morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Physicians as key members of the provision of healthcare are expected to be well aware of the administration and regulations surrounding HAMs. However, the current status is unknown in Pakistan. Consequently, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge of Pakistani physicians about the administration, regulation, and practices related to HAMs. This builds on our recently published study with nurses. Methods: An online cross-sectional study design was used, and data were gathered from the physicians throughout Pakistan using previously used self-administered questionnaires during a period of 5 months (January 1 to May 30, 2021). All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 22 for Windows. Results: Physicians (847) who provided consent were enrolled in the study. Most physicians (62.2%) were male, aged between 25 and 30 years (75.2%) and had 2- to 5-year work experience (50.9%). About 27% were working in the emergency departments. The median (IQR) knowledge score for HAMs administration and regulation was 5 (3) and 5 (2), respectively. About 46.4% of respondents were found to have moderate knowledge about HAMs; increasing age, work experience, and higher qualifications were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with better HAMs knowledge. Around 58% had good practices relating to HAMs during their routine work. Median practice scores increased significantly (p < 0.05) with age, work experience, and postgraduate qualification. Conclusion: Most Pakistani physicians possess moderate knowledge about HAMs administration and regulations. However, their practices relating to the HAMs administration and regulations are typically sub-optimal. Consequently, HAMs awareness needs to be improved by including course content in the current curriculum, provision of hospital-based continuous training programs about patient safety and care, and establishment of multi-disciplinary health care teams, including board-certified pharmacists and specialized nurses, for the effective execution of medication use process in Pakistani hospitals in the future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1588,35360007,"A roadmap for the development and evaluation of the eHealthResp online course. Background Inappropriate antibiotic use constitutes one of the most concerning public health issues, being one of the main causes of antibiotic resistance. Hence, to tackle this issue, it is important to encourage the development of educational interventions for health practitioners, namely by using digital health tools. This study focuses on the description of the development and validation process of the eHealthResp online course, a web platform directed to physicians and pharmacists, with the overall goal of improving antibiotic use for respiratory tract infections, along with the assessment of its usability. Methods The eHealthResp platform and the courses, developed with a user-centered design and based on Wordpress and MySQL, were based on a previously developed online course. A questionnaire to assess the usability was distributed among physicians (n = 6) and pharmacists (n = 6). Based on the obtained results, statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the usability score and appraise the design of the online course, as well as to compare the overall scores attributed by both groups. Further qualitative comments provided by the participants have also been analyzed. Results The eHealthResp contains two online courses directed to physicians and pharmacists aiming to aid in the management of respiratory tract infections. The average usability score of the eHealthResp online courses for physicians and pharmacists was of 78.33 (±11.57, 95%CI), and 83.75 (±15.90, 95%CI), respectively. Qualitative feedback emphasized the usefulness of the course, including overall positive reviews regarding user-friendliness and consistency. Conclusions This study led us to conclude that the eHealthResp online course is not recognized as a complex web platform, as both qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained were globally positive.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1589,35360810,"Knowledge, attitude and practice towards pharmacovigilance among ayurveda physicians and teachers of Gujarat State: A cross sectional study. Aim The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards pharmacovigilance for Ayurveda among the teachers and practitioners working in Ayurveda colleges of Gujarat State. Materials and Methods A survey questionnaire with 29 questions covering points like participants' knowledge, attitude and practice towards pharmacovigilance, adverse drug reaction reporting, and misleading advertisements related Ayurveda drugs was developed in Google form format. The study was carried out during December 2020 and January 2021. Question-wise analysis was made and their percentage value was calculated with the help of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in MS Office 2010. The result was presented using simple frequencies with percentages in appropriate tables. Results Results from this study show that majority of the respondents were having a good knowledge regarding the concept of pharmacovigilance and ADRs in terms of their definitions and purposes. But, a complete knowledge regarding the structure of present national and international pharmacovigilance programme, reporting the ADR and its format were still lacking among majority of the participants. An encouraging attitude towards reporting of adverse drug reaction of ASU&H drugs and teaching of Pharmacovigilance for all the healthcare professionals by majority of the participants was observed. Further maximum participants opine a mandatory rule for reporting of ADR by Physicians, Pharmacist and Nursing staff. A major part of respondents (78.03%) opine that poor quality of drug, medication errors, prescription errors, dispensing errors are part of Pharmacovigilance under drug-related problems. The observed positive attitude is not being reflected in term of practice i.e., reporting of ADR related to Ayurveda drugs. One-third of the participants reported their experience about adverse drug reactions during their professional practice, out of which very few have reported ADRs. Difficulty in deciding or identifying the ADR and lack of time to report ADR is one of the major factor discouraging the participants from reporting ADRs. A large number of respondents were also not familiar with reporting misleading advertisements. Conclusion Findings of this study reflects a good knowledge of the participants about the concept of Pharmacovigilance but unfamiliarity about the programme. The positive attitude towards practice of Pharmacovigilance and ADR reporting can be converted to foster pharmacovigilance practice through series of awareness programmes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1590,35361211,"Reevaluation of adverse drug reactions of psychiatric drugs under the chinese drug volume-based procurement policy. BACKGROUND The ""4 + 7"" volume-based procurement is a ""large group purchase"" led by the Chinese government, with the aim of reducing the price of medicines by trading volume for price. Although the ""4 + 7"" drugs had passed the national consistency evaluation, the adverse drug reactions need to be further evaluated to ensure the safety of the ""4 + 7"" drugs with low prices. We aimed to analyze the occurrence characteristics and related influencing factors of adverse reactions of psychiatric drugs under the chinese drug volume-based procurement policy(4 + 7 policy), and provide references for clinical medication. METHODS 137 cases of adverse drug reactions of four psychotropic drugs reported under the ""4 + 7"" policy in Wuxi Mental Health Center in 2020 were collected. The gender and age of patients, related ""4 + 7"" drugs, involving organs / systems, clinical manifestations, distribution of new / serious adverse reactions, clinic outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 137 cases of adverse drug reactions, the incidence of adverse drug reactions was the highest in patients aged 61-70 (25.38%). Mainly involved 4 ""4 + 7"" psychiatric drugs, of which olanzapine tablets caused the most adverse reactions (54, 39.24%). The adverse reactions mainly involved the digestive system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, blood and lymphatic system, among which the digestive system was the most common (61, 44.53%). A total of 8 cases (6.16%) of new and 26 cases of serious adverse reactions were reported, all of which led to the prolongation of disease course. Except for the transient side effects, most of that were improved or cured with no death, disability or teratogenicity after stopping or reducing the dose with symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION Since more and more drugs will be included in ""4 + 7"" for clinic, clinical pharmacists should strengthen the publicity and training of the knowledge of ""4 + 7"" drugs, strengthen the monitoring of adverse drug reactions, and provide timely feedback to the clinic, in order to achieve early prevention, early identification, timely diagnosis and reasonable intervention of the adverse drug reactions under the context of ""4 + 7"" policy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1593,35361619,"Impact of a pharmaceutical intervention on influenza vaccination in patients receiving treatment with biological medicines. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were twofold - to determine the impact of a health education intervention led by a hospital pharmacy department on influenza vaccination take-up in patients diagnosed with immune-mediated diseases. Patients were receiving treatment with biological medicines. Secondly, to compare those rates with the vaccination percentages of another hospital pharmacy with similar characteristics in which no educational intervention was conducted. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with immune-mediated diseases receiving treatment with biological medicines. The medicines were dispensed by the hospital pharmacy departments of two hospitals between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020. In Cohort A (intervention group), a health education strategy was implemented with regards to influenza vaccination. Cohort B acted as a control group. The influenza vaccination rates obtained in both cohorts during 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULT A total of 355 patients took part in the study - 148 (41.7%) in Cohort A and 207 (58.3%) in Cohort B. The hospital pharmacy department in Cohort A implemented a health education strategy after which the vaccination percentage during the 2020 campaign increased by 38 patients (45.7%), compared with a 10 patient (5.8%) increase in Cohort B (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The health intervention by the pharmacy department had a positive impact. This included an opportunity to improve vaccination take-up and is a strategy to consider when implementing a vaccination programme. Health education is a fundamental objective of healthcare. In our case it led to an increase in vaccination and had a positive impact on public health. It also provides opportunities for pharmacists to work in a multidisciplinary way with other healthcare professionals.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Ambulatory,
1594,35361995,"Combining familial hypercholesterolemia and statin genetic studies as a strategy for the implementation of pharmacogenomics. A multidisciplinary approach.  The diagnostic process of familial hypercholesterolemia frequently involves the use of genetic studies. Patients are treated with lipid-lowering drugs, frequently statins. Although pharmacogenomic clinical practice guidelines focusing on genotype-based statin prescription have been published, their use in routine clinical practice remains very modest.We have implemented a new NGS strategy that combines a panel of genes related to familial hypercholesterolemia with genomic regions related to the pharmacogenomics of lipid-lowering drugs described in clinical practice guidelines and in EMA and FDA drug labels. A multidisciplinary team of doctors, biologists, and pharmacists creates a clinical report that provides diagnostic and therapeutic findings using a knowledge management and clinical decision support system, as well as an algorithm for treatment selection.For 12 months, a total of 483 genetic diagnostic studies for familial hypercholesterolemia were carried out, of which 221 (45.8%) requested a complementary pharmacogenomic test. Of these 221 patients, 66.5% were carriers of actionable variants in any of the studied pharmacogenomic pathways: 46.6% of patients in one pathway, 19.0% in two pathways, and 0.9% in three pathways. 45.7% of patients could have a response to atorvastatin different from that of the reference population, 45.7% for simvastatin and lovastatin, 29.0% for fluvastatin, and 6.7% patients for pitavastatin.This implementation approach facilitates the incorporation of pharmacogenomic studies in clinical care practice, it does not add complexity nor additional steps to laboratory processes, and improves the pharmacotherapeutic process of patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1595,35362208,"Characteristics of hospitals that report adverse drug reactions: Results of a nationwide survey in Japan. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the primary reasons for hospitalization. The spontaneous reporting of ADRs by healthcare professionals is important for issuing post-marketing drug safety measures. The Japanese Society of Hospital Pharmacists (JSHP) conducts a nationwide survey annually. Using data from this large-scale survey, we identified the characteristics of hospitals that reported ADRs to regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies. METHODS Data were obtained from annual surveys conducted by JSHP from 2015 to 2020. All variables were expressed as categorical variables and tabulated. The Chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variables. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to identify significant trends in the proportion of hospitals reporting ADRs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION From 2015 to 2020, 22,362 responses were recorded. There was a significant increase in the proportion of hospitals that reported ADRs with an increase in number of beds and pharmacists (p < 0.0001). The proportion of hospitals reporting ADRs to regulatory authorities was also significantly higher in those charging an additional fee for pharmacist-performed ward operations and in those with an ADR data management section than in hospitals without these attributes (p < 0.0001). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Hospitals that submitted ADR reports to the regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies charged an additional fee for pharmacist-performed ward operations, had a central ADR data management section, and had fewer beds per pharmacist.

This study investigates the rates and types of criminal convictions encountered by New Zealand's Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal (HPDT) over a 15-year period. Criminal convictions appeared in 24% (n = 101) of cases, with male practitioners (p < 0.01) and pharmacists (p < 0.05) being significantly over-represented. The most frequent types of convictions included crimes against rights of property (33.6%), sexual/morality/decency crimes (21.9%) and misuse of drugs (8.4%). Criminal behaviour settings were evenly split between personal and professional life for medical practitioners (56.5% professional life) and nurses (56.5% professional life) but disproportionately in professional life (85%) for pharmacists. Criminal conviction cases were significantly more likely to result in registration cancellation (p < 0.001) and practice suspensions (p < 0.05) when compared with non-criminal cases, although fewer fines were ordered (p < 0.001).

1598,35363886,"What determines health professionals' COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy?: A nationwide study. INTRODUCTION To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, higher vaccination rates are essential. However, as vaccine hesitancy is a reality, it is important to understand what drives health professionals to refuse getting vaccinated against COVID-19, who have been in the frontline of this pandemic since its beginning and may be key actors to improve vaccine coverage among their patients. PURPOSE This study aims to assess the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy (VH) among health professionals (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and dentists). METHODS A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey, with 890 Portuguese health professionals. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of the independent variables (perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes) per 1-point increase in the Likert scale and VH. RESULTS Complacency, communications, confidence, and convenience were strongly associated with VH probability. Concerns about vaccines' efficacy (ORPhysicians =8.33, 95%CI:4.51-15.36) and safety (ORNurses =11.07, 95%CI:4.12-29.77) increase the risk of VH on all health professional groups. A reduction of VH probability is associated with higher risk perceptions of getting infected (1/ORNurses =2.76, 95%CI:1.52-5.02) and suffering complications (1/ORNurses =33.72, 95%CI:8.48-134.13), higher confidence in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines (1/ORDentists =12.29, 95%CI:2.91-51.89), risk perception of getting infected if vaccinated (1/ORPhysicians = 14.92, 95%CI:6.85-32.50), risk of suffering from complications after getting vaccinated, and higher trust levels on the information transmitted by competent authorities (1/ORDentists =17.76, 95%CI:3.83-82.22). CONCLUSIONS To reduce COVID-19 VH, which appears to be highly influenced by perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes, it is essential to promote interventions directed to transforming these potentially modifiable determinants.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1599,35364752,"Gaps in pharmaceutical care for patients with mental health issues: A cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Medications are a primary method of managing mental health problems, and pharmacists therefore have a vital role in supporting patients and providing them with information about the safety and efficacy of mental health medications. However, the potential role of pharmacists in managing mental health issues in Jordan has not been well established. AIM This study aimed to assess Jordanian pharmacists' attitudes and actual practices related to the provision of mental health services. METHOD This was an exploratory cross-sectional study that used a self-report questionnaire among a convenience sample of 347 pharmacists in Amman, the capital of Jordan. RESULTS The participating pharmacists had positive attitudes towards providing care for patients with mental health problems. However, their actual practices did not resonate with their enthusiasm, particularly in terms of the long-term follow-up of disease symptoms and medication side effects and adherence. The participating pharmacists showed an eagerness to collaborate with their colleagues, but their level of actual cooperation was lower than desired. The most commonly reported barrier to providing care for patients with mental health problems was the lack of education on mental health issues (71.5%), followed by the lack of privacy in pharmacy settings (53.9%). CONCLUSIONS To be effectively involved in the provision of care to mental health patients, pharmacists should receive adequate education/training related to mental health issues, and pharmacies should be redesigned to provide private areas for patient counseling.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1600,35365212,"Redistribution of critical drugs in shortage during the first wave of COVID-19 in France: from operating theaters to intensive care units. BACKGROUND Tension in the supply of highly consumed drugs for patients with COVID-19 (propofol, midazolam, curares) led the French government to set up a centralized supply of hospitals with distribution based on the number of resuscitation beds in March 2020. The French Societies of Clinical Pharmacy and of Anesthesia and Critical Care aimed to evaluate the changes in total needs and the distribution between anesthesia and critical care activities (CCU), to prepare resumed surgical activity. METHODS National declarative survey among pharmacists, via an online form (SurveyMonkey®), was conducted in April and May 2020. The analysis focused on quantities dispensed during the whole year 2019, and March and April of year 2019 and 2020 for the drugs subject to quota, and on their distribution in CCU and operating theaters. RESULTS For the 358 establishments (47% public, 53% private), dispensations in CCU in March 2020 compared to March 2019 increased, respectively: propofol (+81%), midazolam (+125%), cisatracurium (+311%), atracurium (+138%), rocuronium (+119%); and decreased for anaesthesia: propofol (-27%), midazolam (-10%), cisatracurium (-19%), atracurium (-27%), rocuronium (+16%). CONCLUSIONS Variation of dispensations between CCU and others was directly related to the increase of COVID patients in CCU and the decrease in surgical activity. Each establishment could receive up to five or six different presentations and concentrations, leading to a major risk of medication error. This collaborative national survey provided accurate data on the drugs' usual consumption. This work emphasized the need for a strong collaboration between pharmacists and anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians.

1601,35365405,"Improving access to care via psychiatric clinical pharmacist practitioner collaborative management of buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. BACKGROUND As the death toll continues to rise in the opioid overdose epidemic, increasing access to medications for opioid use disorder (OUD), such as buprenorphine, is vital. Psychiatric clinical pharmacist practitioners (CPPs) can help bridge the gap in care but are limited in their ability to prescribe buprenorphine given federal restrictions. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe a pharmacist-psychiatrist collaborative practice designed to increase access to buprenorphine for OUD in rural communities by maximizing the CPP role. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION A CPP operating under a scope of practice with prescriptive authority to manage substance use disorders (SUDs) and comorbid mental health conditions was hired in June of 2020 at a rural Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in Tomah, Wisconsin. PRACTICE INNOVATION A collaborative agreement with X-waivered psychiatrists was established to manage buprenorphine for patients with OUD. EVALUATION METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients with an OUD diagnosis from July 1, 2020, to October 31, 2021, to assess the use of medications for OUD, comorbid psychiatric, and SUD diagnoses; active naloxone prescription; and CPP involvement in care. For patients prescribed buprenorphine, their average wait time to initiation appointment was calculated in days and compared before and after CPP implementation. RESULTS As of October 31, 2021, there were 60 patients with OUD cared for by the Tomah VA, of whom 28 received buprenorphine comanaged with the CPP. On average, those requesting urgent access appointment for buprenorphine assessment from the CPP were seen for same-day induction appointments compared with historically an average of a 6.1 day wait for outpatient appointments and 5.8 days for scheduled inpatient inductions. CONCLUSION Collaborative approaches to buprenorphine management with a CPP improve access to care. Although collaboration decreases time burden for X-waivered psychiatrists, care could be more efficient and timely if a CPP could independently induct, stabilize, and manage patients on buprenorphine.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Psychiatric,,,,Ambulatory,
1602,35365406,"Exploring the frontline experiences of pharmacy technicians during the opioid epidemic in community pharmacies. BACKGROUND The opioid epidemic continues to have a significant negative impact on public health in the United States. Community pharmacies represent an important care setting in confronting the opioid epidemic. However, they continue to be an underutilized care access point. Pharmacy technicians are often the first and most frequent pharmacy personnel to interact with people receiving a prescription for opioid medications. There is a paucity of studies conducted with pharmacy technicians as it pertains to interactions with these patients. OBJECTIVES To explore community pharmacy technicians' roles and their personal experiences when interacting with patients who are receiving a prescription for opioid medications. METHODS A qualitative design was employed in use of focus groups (FGs) conducted virtually across several regions of the United States. Audio recordings of U.S. FGs were transcribed verbatim and imported via Dedoose (v2.0, Dedoose, Manhattan Beach, CA,) for further data assessment using thematic analysis. The researchers used the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS In total, 46 pharmacy technicians participated in 8 FGs. The average length of time for FG was 56 minutes. The mean for the work experience was 7 years, with a range of 1 to 44. Of 46 subjects, 34 were working in a community setting, and the rest were in a hospital setting. Most of the subjects practiced in Tennessee and California at the time of the study. Two themes emerged from the data: ""Interactions between pharmacy technicians and patients who are using opioid prescriptions,"" and ""Interactions between pharmacy technicians and the pharmacy team while dispensing opioid prescriptions.""

1606,35365533,"Feasibility, accessibility and acceptability a pharmacist-led ear health intervention at rural community pharmacies (LISTEN UP): a mixed-methods study in Queensland, Australia. OBJECTIVE Ear disease in rural and remote communities is occurring at high rates, with limited access to health services and health providers contributing to the problem. Community pharmacists are well-placed to provide expanded services to improve ear health in rural communities. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, accessibility and acceptability of a pharmacist-led intervention for ear disease in consumers presenting to community pharmacy. DESIGN Prospective preintervention and postintervention mixed-methods study. An ethnographic lens of rural culture was applied to the descriptive qualitative component of the study. SETTING Two rural community pharmacies in Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS People aged 6 months or older, who present with an ear complaint to a participating community pharmacy. INTERVENTION LISTEN UP (Locally Integrated Screening and Testing Ear aNd aUral Programme) is a community pharmacy-based intervention to improve the management of ear health. Trained pharmacists conducted ear examinations using otoscopy and tympanometry on consumers following a LISTEN UP protocol. They made recommendations including no treatment, pharmacy only products or general practitioner (GP) referral. Consumers were contacted 7 days later for follow-up. RESULTS 55 rural consumers participated in the study. The most commonly reported complaints were 'blocked ear' and 'ear pain'. Pharmacists recommended over-the-counter products to two-thirds of the participants and referred one quarter to a GP. 90% (50/55) of the consumers were highly satisfied with the service and would recommend the service. All consumers described the service positively with particular reference to convenience, improved confidence and appreciation of the knowledge gained about their ear complaint. Pharmacists were motivated to upskill and manage workflow to incorporate the service and expected both consumers and GPs to be more accepting of future expanded services as a result of LISTEN UP. However, without funding to provide the service, during the study other remunerated pharmacy tasks took priority over providing LISTEN UP. CONCLUSION Rural community pharmacists can provide an acceptable and accessible ear health service; however, it is not feasible without a clear funding structure to provide resources including additional pharmacists, equipment and training.

BACKGROUND Loop diuretics help to manage the patients with edema associated with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease and hypertension. The patients taking loop diuretics may receive other medications to treat comorbidities leading to drug interactions. METHODOLOGY The literature was searched in databases such as Medline/PMC/PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, EMBASE, Web of science, Ebsco, Directory of open access journals (DOAJ) and reference lists to spot relevant articles using the keywords Drug interactions, Pharmacodynamic interactions, Loop diuretics, Bumetanide, Ethacrynic acid, Furosemide, and Torsemide. RESULTS Loop diuretics are associated with hypokalemia, ototoxicity and other adverse effects. The drugs affected by hypokalemia, and having the potential of inducing ototoxicity could interact with loop diuretics pharmacodynamically. Loop diuretics can interact with drugs such as amphotericin B, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), antidiabetic drugs, antifungal agents, dobutamine, gossypoland sotalol due to diuretic associated hypokalemia. In addition, the risk of ototoxicity could be enhanced by the concomitant use of loop diuretics and cisplatin, aminoglycoside antibiotics or phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors. Loop diuretics may also interact pharmacodynamically with drugs like cephalosporins, ceritinib, levothyroxine, pixantrone, probenecid, lithium, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfonylureas and herbal drugs. CONCLUSION Clinicians, pharmacists and other health care providers should take responsibility for the safe use of medications. In addition, they are required to be aware of the drugs interacting with loop diuretics, to prevent adverse drug interactions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Afghanistan, a low-income landlocked country, is continuously suffering from domestic war and conflicts; the country struggles to provide quality healthcare services, including affordable medicinal products in the required quantity. Moreover, the quality standards of domestic pharmaceutical companies have not been established yet. One of the internationally recognized guidelines for monitoring manufacturing processes in pharmaceutical companies is Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether a pharmaceutical company in Kabul, Afghanistan adheres to the GMP standards established by WHO. METHOD A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the WHO-delineated GMP compliance of 25 pharmaceutical companies in Kabul, Afghanistan. The inspection checklist was developed by Afghanistan's National Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (NMHRA) using the WHO-delineated GMP guidelines. In addition, direct observation, interviews with respective delegates, and documentation reviews were conducted to collect research data. RESULT Only 38.33% (1.14 ± 1.08) of GMP contents were complied. Personnel 66.67% (2 ± 1.15) and materials 58.67% (1.76 ± 1.11) were the most commonly complied components, whereas the product recall 12.98% (0.39 ± 0.85), quality assurance 16.44% (0.49 ± 0.81) and quality control laboratory 28.35% (0.85 ± 1.12) were the least complied ones.

1609,35367143,"Brighter horizons: The necessity of concentrated sponsorship targeted toward minoritized student pharmacists.  Due to the effects of structural racism, disproportionately lower numbers of Black, Hispanic or LatinX, American Indian, and Alaska Native students pursue a career in pharmacy and successfully matriculate into the profession. Despite these disparities being present for many years, little progress has been achieved in diversifying the pharmacy profession, resulting in a persistent lack of diversity within pharmacy leadership across employers and pharmacy organizations. Consistent with recent recommendations for improving diversity in pharmacy, the PharmGradWishlist (PGWL) initiative was created as a way for practicing pharmacists and organizations to provide direct financial sponsorship to racially and ethnically minoritized trainees to offset costs incurred during training and during the transition from student to practicing pharmacist. Many of these costs, such as residency and fellowship application fees, job interview travel costs, board exam and licensing fees, and moving expenses, are not typically subsidized by federal student funding. Offsetting these costs is an important way to reduce barriers to entering the profession and postgraduate training, the latter of which may be particularly important in trainees' pursuit of academic and leadership positions in pharmacy. The initial development and advertisement of the initiative occurred through social media and the grassroots efforts of the PGWL team, a group of 10 volunteer pharmacists from across the country, and resulted in generous donations from a small proportion of practicing pharmacists nationwide. It is now time for the profession as a whole to embrace the role of direct sponsorship in improving diversity in the profession. We call upon pharmacists and pharmacy organizations to advocate for and participate in financial sponsorship of racially and ethnically minoritized trainees and pharmacists as a way to increase diversity and promote health equity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1610,35367164,"Exploring rates of PCSK9 inhibitor persistence and reasons for treatment non-persistence in an integrated specialty pharmacy model. BACKGROUND Nearly 40% of patients do not continue proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) therapy after 6 months, despite their ability to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and risk of cardiovascular events. Limited work has assessed persistence to PCSK9i therapy in an integrated specialty pharmacy model. OBJECTIVE To assess rates of persistence to PCSK9i therapy and report reasons for non-persistence in patients serviced within an integrated specialty pharmacy. METHODS We conducted a single-center, retrospective review of patients prescribed a PCSK9i at an academic health system between September 2015 and August 2018. Persistence was calculated as a binary measure (yes/no) of whether the patient was still receiving PCSK9i therapy at 3-, 12-, and 24-months; frequency distributions described reasons for non-persistence and descriptive statistics described the change in LDL-C from baseline to 24 months. RESULTS 477 patients met inclusion criteria, 53% were male with median age of 63 years [IQR 56-70]. Median LDL-C at baseline was 157mg/dL and 86% had an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease indication. Persistence at 3-, 12-, and 24-months was 94%, 80%, and 68%, respectively. Of the 262 patients persistent on PCSK9i therapy at 24 months with LDL-C values available, median LDL-C was 65 mg/dL. The most common reasons for non-persistence at 24 months included medication adverse effects (54%) and loss to follow-up (17%). CONCLUSIONS High rates of persistence to PCSK9i were seen in patients receiving care within an integrated specialty pharmacy model compared with rates in previous studies, suggesting specialty pharmacists may play a role in mitigating many common reasons for PCSK9i non-persistence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1611,35367998,"An Investigation on the Consciousness of Patients and Pharmacists Regarding Inhaler Education.  Few studies have focused on the awareness of inhaler education in patients and pharmacists who have crucial roles in inhaler education. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in awareness of inhaler education between patients and pharmacists. We conducted questionnaire-based surveys involving 270 patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 139 pharmacists of 13 pharmacies belonging to the same chain dispensing pharmacy in Hyogo prefecture of Japan in July 2011. We obtained valid responses from 230 patients (85.2%) and 139 pharmacists (100%). Although 75% of pharmacists provided inhaler education about the importance of continuation, only 16% of patients felt that they had learned the importance of continuation. Similarly, 95% of pharmacists provided inhaler education about the importance of gargling, however, only 57% of patients felt that they had learned the importance of gargling. This survey clarified the difference in awareness between pharmacists and patients on inhaler education. It proved to be difficult to educate patients on the importance of compliance and gargling.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE The impact of goal setting in pharmacy preceptor development was evaluated using the Habits of Preceptors Rubric (HOP-R), a criterion-referenced assessment developed to assess, quantify, and demonstrate growth across 11 preceptor habits. METHODS This study retrospectively evaluated initial and follow-up survey responses from the 2019-2020 Clinician Educators Program cohort at Midwestern University College of Pharmacy, Glendale Campus. Enrollees in this teaching and learning curriculum (TLC) were invited to assess their precepting habits using the HOP-R after attending the first seminar and again toward the end of the longitudinal program. Using online surveys, participants rated their precepting capabilities as developing, proficient, accomplished, or master level for each habit. In the initial survey, each participant selected a habit of focus for deliberate development and established an individualized goal using the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) framework. In the follow-up survey, participants indicated their satisfaction with and progress toward accomplishing their precepting goal. RESULTS Initial survey results from 55 study participants identified developing as the most frequently self-reported habit level (53%; n = 605 ratings), while master was the least frequently reported (1%). In the follow-up assessment, accomplished (45%) was the most frequently self-reported habit level, while master (5%) remained the least reported. The cohort reported a median progress in SMART goal accomplishment of 69% (range, 12% to 100%; n = 54). CONCLUSION Preceptors and resident pharmacists reported perceived advancement in precepting capabilities within the conceptual framework of the HOP-R encompassing both their self-selected habit of focus and adjacent habits while enrolled in a TLC.

Background Few studies have described associations between the AKI biomarkers urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) with AKI in cisplatin-treated children. We aimed to describe excretion patterns of urine NGAL and KIM-1 and associations with AKI in children receiving cisplatin. Methods Participants (n=159) were enrolled between 2013 and 2017 in a prospective cohort study conducted in 12 Canadian pediatric hospitals. Participants were evaluated at early cisplatin infusions (at first or second cisplatin cycle) and late cisplatin infusions (last or second-to-last cycle). Urine NGAL and KIM-1 were measured (1) pre-cisplatin infusion, (2) post-infusion (morning after), and (3) at hospital discharge at early and late cisplatin infusions. Primary outcome: AKI defined by serum creatinine rise within 10 days post-cisplatin, on the basis of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines criteria (stage 1 or higher). Results Of 159 children, 156 (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age: 5.8 [2.4-12.0] years; 78 [50%] female) had biomarker data available at early cisplatin infusions and 127 had data at late infusions. Forty six of the 156 (29%) and 22 of the 127 (17%) children developed AKI within 10 days of cisplatin administration after early and late infusions, respectively. Urine NGAL and KIM-1 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with versus without AKI (near hospital discharge of late cisplatin infusion, median [IQR] NGAL levels were 76.1 [10.0-232.7] versus 14.9 [5.4-29.7] ng/mg creatinine; KIM-1 levels were 4415 [2083-9077] versus 1049 [358-3326] pg/mg creatinine; P<0.01). These markers modestly discriminated for AKI (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC] range: NGAL, 0.56-0.72; KIM-1, 0.48-0.75). Biomarker concentrations were higher and better discriminated for AKI at late cisplatin infusions (AUC-ROC range, 0.54-0.75) versus early infusions (AUC-ROC range, 0.48-0.65). Conclusions Urine NGAL and KIM-1 were modest at discriminating for cisplatin-associated AKI.

Background Oncology advanced practitioners (APs), including nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, physician assistants, and clinical pharmacists contribute significantly to quality cancer care. Advanced practitioners enhance value across the spectrum of cancer care. Research is an underdeveloped component of quality care, as well as an underdeveloped component of AP practice. Understanding research-related attitudes and roles of APs could lead to enhanced clinical trial accrual, conduct, and protocol development. Methods A nationwide survey addressing attitudes, beliefs, and roles of APs regarding clinical research was distributed by the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) and Harborside in early 2020. Results 408 oncology APs completed the survey. Thirty-five percent practice in an academic setting and 62% in the community. Nearly all respondents believe clinical trials are important to improve care, and over 90% report clinical trials are available at their practice. About 80% report being comfortable discussing the topic of clinical trials with patients and are involved in the care of trial participants. Sixty percent are comfortable discussing available trials, and 38% routinely explore available trials with patients. While 70% report approaching eligible patients about trials, only 20% report doing so ""a great deal"" or ""a lot."" Ninety percent report that APs should play a role in clinical research, and 73% want to be more involved. Barriers identified to greater AP clinical trial involvement include lack of time, inadequate awareness of trial specifics, and a lack of a formal role in protocol development and leadership. Conclusions Advanced practitioners are engaged and interested in clinical trials and believe clinical research is important to improve cancer care. Multidisciplinary team integration, trials-related education, and policy change are needed to employ APs to their full potential within cancer clinical trials.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background and Aim Gold nanorods (AuNRs) have gained much attention recent years due to their promising optical and chemical properties and are hence used in applied research and industrial nanotechnology. This study was designed to investigate the effect of gold nanoparticle shape (Gold nanorods vs. gold nanosphere) on immune response in rabbit. Materials and Methods Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into six groups (n=5 rabbits). The first group is the control negative received an intravenous (IV) injection of normal saline 0.9%; the second group (vaccinated) is the control positive, and the other four groups were vaccinated and received a single-dose or repeated five consecutive IV doses of 300 mg/kg body weight 50 nm AuNRs or 50 nm gold nanosphere (50 nm AuNSs) dissolved in ultrapure water. Blood and serum were collected for the hematological and biochemical analysis. Results White blood cells (WBCs) count, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils showed significantly (p<0.05) higher values with the repeated-dose AuNRs. g-globulin levels showed a significant difference after 15 days in the single-dose AuNSs. Single-dose AuNSs significantly (p<0.05) increased the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and significantly (p<0.05) decreased the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In addition, it elicited a significant (p<0.05) decrease in the malondialdehyde levels and a significant (p<0.05) increase of the superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase levels. Moreover, evoked red blood cells count, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were significantly (p<0.05) lower than the control group. The platelet count, lysozymes, and nitric oxide were significantly (p<0.05) higher in repeated-dose AuNRs. Conclusion The effect of AuNPs is shape and dose-dependent. The repeated 5 days IV 50 nm AuNRs doses over 15 days showed a significant antioxidant effect, with no considerable toxicity or vascular reactions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1616,35369889,"Usefulness of criteria for intraoperative Management of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting. BACKGROUND Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) delays postoperative recovery, prolongs hospital stays, and hinders patients' return to society, thus making it a major cause of increased healthcare costs. It is also the most troubling postoperative complication in female patients undergoing surgery. However, in Japan, guidelines for the management of PONV have not been established, and the management protocol for PONV is left to each institution and anesthesiologist. Therefore, we developed criteria for intraoperative management of PONV. METHODS In female surgical patients, the usefulness of the criteria was evaluated by comparing the implementation rate of intraoperative management and PONV incidence before and after the establishment of the criteria. An Apfel simplified score (Apfel score) ≥2 was set as an indication for intraoperative management of PONV. RESULTS The implementation rate of intraoperative management increased from 91.2 to 96.0% after the introduction of the criteria. In patients with an Apfel score of 2, the intraoperative management implementation rate significantly increased from 81.1 to 94.7% (p = 0.016), while PONV incidence significantly decreased from 44.6 to 34.1% after the introduction of the criteria (p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS The criteria for intraoperative management of PONV increased the implementation rate of intraoperative management and decreased PONV incidence, indicating the usefulness of the criteria.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Industrial reforms utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) have been progressing remarkably around the world in recent years. In medical informatics, the application of medical big data analytics using AI is also being promoted, and it is expected to provide screening methods for predicting potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and discovering new effects. Previously, we developed a unique ADRs analysis system that incorporates Accord.NET, an open-source machine learning (ML) framework written in the programming language C#, and uses the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. By using this system to analyze ADRs and screening the cause and severity of ADRs, information can be obtained to evaluate efficacy as well as ADRs. Although both statistical methods and ML are commonly used for prediction, a characteristic difference between them is that the former emphasizes causal relationships and the latter emphasizes prediction results. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between cases where decisions must be made with an emphasis on causality and those where decisions must be made by focusing on unknown risks, and statistical methods and ML should be selected and used as appropriate. Against this backdrop, this paper describes a use case and suggests that the proper use of AI tools to analyze medical big data will help clinical pharmacists practice optimal drug management for each patient.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The JMDC Claims Database® contains completely anonymized receipt information on the insured members of health insurance associations. The number of registered users is approximately 9.6 million (6% of the population) as of May 2020. In this database, it is possible to track even outpatient treatment, even if the patient changes the medical facility, as long as the insurer of the subscriber's health insurance does not change, so that long-term medical treatment could be targeted as a research theme. However, as the data do not contain medical record information, it is not possible to obtain laboratory values, although it is possible to know whether clinical tests have been performed. For pharmaceutics-related research, the most suitable use of the receipt database like JMDC Claims Database® seems to be the investigation of actual prescriptions. However, the research topics that pharmacists are interested in are probably comparisons of drug effects, drug-drug interactions, or causal analysis of drugs and side effects. However, laboratory data for evaluating drug efficacy is not available in the receipt database, and the accuracy of the disease name in the database becomes problematic when using the disease name as information indicating the occurrence of side effects.

1622,35370197,"[Impact of Change in Community Pharmacists' Role on Their Estimated Demand].  Pharmacists play a key role in optimizing the safe and effective use of medicines in the super-aged society in Japan. Recently, community pharmacists' role has been transformed and expanded to provide patient-centered care. This study aimed to simulate a change in the demand for community pharmacists resulting from this shift in their role, from 2019 to 2035. The change in demand was estimated by the number of prescriptions obtained from publicly available sources of information. The number of required community pharmacists was calculated separately for full-time and part-time pharmacists and the pharmacists engaged in home medical care. This number was calculated using the estimated demand, the number of prescriptions dispensed per day, and annual working days. We evaluated the effect of changes in the working conditions, which include changes in the dispensing process time, rate of part-time staff and their work time, and number of home medical care per day, on the number of community pharmacists. When the number of prescriptions dispensed per day was set at 19.8, the demand for community pharmacists was estimated as 188,314 in 2035. Furthermore, due to the changes in the working conditions, the demand is expected to change from 153,362 to 266,944. Although the increasing provision of drug information time leads to an increasing number of pharmacists, combining it with work efficiency services could prevent or decrease it.

1623,35370483,"The Quality of Counseling for Headache OTC Medications in German Community Pharmacies Using a Simulated Patient Approach: Are There Differences between Self-Purchase and Purchase for a Third Party? Background In Germany-as worldwide-headache is one of the most frequent causes of self-medication. The dispensing of over-the-counter (OTC) medications may only be carried out by community pharmacies (CPs). In doing so, CPs have to ensure ""adequate"" counseling, for both self-purchase and purchase for a third party, which also occurs in everyday pharmacy practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of counseling for headache OTC medications in German CPs and, as the first study worldwide, to analyze whether and to what extent there are differences in counseling between self-purchase and purchase for a third party. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out using the covert simulated patient methodology (SPM) in all 42 CPs in the German big city Potsdam. With the help of 8 trained simulated patients (SPs), each CP was visited four times by a different SP. The SPs simulated in each CP two scenarios two times with the demand for an OTC medication against headache, which differed only in whether the demand was for themselves or for their boyfriend/girlfriend. Results All 168 planned pharmacy visits (84 visits per scenario) were successfully carried out. Overall, the median counseling score was 3.0 out of 9 points (interquartile range [IQR 2.0]). There were no significant differences between the two scenarios (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p=0.495, r = 0.053). In a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, the counseling level and the different scenarios were not significantly associated (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.635, 95% CI = 0.673-3.972, p=0.278). Conclusions Due to the partly considerable deficits in counseling of German CPs, policy-makers and the regional chambers of pharmacists are called upon to take appropriate measures to improve the quality of counseling. It is positive that no differences in counseling between self-purchase and purchase for a third party were found, but further verifying studies with a modified methodology are recommended.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction: Albumin is an expensive non-blood plasma substitutes with limited availability that has been reported to be inappropriately used in healthcare settings. Hence, interventions are recommended to control its misuse. Objective: To evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacist implemented dispensing protocol on optimization of albumin use in an intensive care unit (ICU). Design: A retrospective prospective 3-phase interventional study was conducted in an ICU in a tertiary Egyptian hospital over a period of 2 years. Methods: The study included three phases; a preparation phase where a local albumin dispensing protocol and a restriction dispensing form were prepared by clinical pharmacists and was approved by the local Drugs and Therapeutics Committee, a retrospective pre-implementation phase in which the medical records of all ICU patients receiving albumin were evaluated for appropriateness of albumin use according to the developed protocol, and a prospective implementation phase where the dispensing protocol and restriction dispensing form were applied. The pattern of albumin consumption and cost were recorded and compared between the retrospective and prospective phases. Results: In the retrospective phase, 190 ICU patients received albumin of whom 83.6% was considered inappropriate indications for albumin compared to only 44 patients in the prospective phase of whom 16% was considered inappropriate (p-value <0.001). Clinical pharmacists' interventions significantly decreased the inappropriate albumin consumption from 4.7 vials/patient in the retrospective phase to 2.7 vials/patient in the prospective phase (p-value <0.001) with a total cost savings of 313,900 Egyptian Pounds (19,930 US Dollars).

PURPOSE The impact of a hospital formulary was evaluated to provide a guide for the establishment of local formularies to optimize patient care and healthcare costs. METHODS A formulary was introduced by formulary pharmacists of the Toda Medical Group for suggesting recommended medicines to physicians based on the medication history. Patients who were hospitalized in the rehabilitation ward of the Niiza Hospital and prescribed medicines according to the formulary introduced between April 2017 and March 2018 were included and followed-up for six months. RESULTS Of the 183 patients screened, 154 patients were enrolled as the formulary's introduction patients (76 males/78 females, median age 78 years); 92% of these patients received formulary-proposed prescriptions at the specified timepoints; and 19 patients re-consulted at the Niiza Hospital after discharge and continued the same formulary medicines. The proposed acceptance rate by physicians was 100%. Most changes suggested introduced generic formulations. The doses were equivalent for all pharmacological classes with the exception of medicines that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system, which fell from 10.7 to 7.2 mg (P< .0001). Overall daily medication costs fell at discharge compared to admission (38.5 vs. 94.6 yen per patient, respectively, P< .0001). This was valid for all pharmacological classes except for calcium channel blockers. CONCLUSION Hospital formulary-prescribed medications continued after discharge and promoted significant decreases in costs associated with outpatient prescriptions.

OBJECTIVES Hospital point prevalence surveys (PPS) are shown to help identifying determinants for inappropriate antimicrobial therapy (AMT) and create feedback opportunities to optimize AMT. METHODS PPS were performed at the AZNikolaas hospital, on four wards with high consumption rates of three alert antibiotics (AB) to judge their appropriateness. The impact of a multidisciplinary interaction between a medical microbiologist, a clinical pharmacist and the prescriber on inappropriate AMT, hospital costs and intravenous AMT days, was analyzed. RESULTS During this survey, 7,39% of hospitalized patients in the selected wards received one or more of three alert antibiotics. Out of 78 prescriptions, 35.90% were judged appropriate, 39.74% inappropriate and 24.36% had insufficient data for judgment. Only the oncology ward was associated with more frequent appropriate use of alert AB. In case of an unknown infection focus or a catheter-related infection, the relative risk of inappropriate use was the highest. Multidisciplinary interaction improved inappropriate AMT in 59% of cases. It resulted in a 2478€ healthcare AMT cost saving and a reduction of 30 intravenous AMT days. CONCLUSIONS This survey shows high consumption rates and a high rate of inappropriate use of three alert AB in the observed wards. It revealed the lack of a local guideline concerning treatment of neutropenic fever of unknown origin and the need for more diagnostic information in electronical medical records. The survey demonstrated that direct feedback on inappropriate AMT to clinicians can be of added value, cost-saving and reducing length of intravenous AMT days.

INTRODUCTION When it comes to non-communicable diseases like diabetes, inadequate knowledge, attitude, and practice are often linked to poor health outcomes. This study aims to assess the patients' knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of diabetes in the outpatient department of a university teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY In this cross-sectional study, diabetes type 2 patients attending outpatient departments at a university teaching hospital, Riyadh, were assessed regarding their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward diabetes using a validated KAP scale. Descriptive and inferential analysis was done to determine the factors associated with KAP score using SPSS version 26.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.). RESULTS Males made up 69.7% of the sample (n = 165), while 56.9% were between the ages of 41 and 75. The level of knowledge and practice had ""good"" in 37.6%, and 47.9%, respectively, but level of attitude had ""positive"" in 30.9% of patients. The association between knowledge tier and gender (p0.014) and insurance status (p0.008), respectively, was shown to be significant. However, the attitude tier was only significantly associated with gender (P = .003). The practice tier also showed a significant age association (P = .049). As regards, the mean scores for diabetes-related knowledge were higher only among insured participants (P = .03) than for other participants' sociodemographic factors. Meanwhile, the mean attitude scores were also higher among males (P = .006) than for other sociodemographic characteristics. A comparison of the participants' sociodemographic characteristics found no statistically significant variations in practice scores. CONCLUSION Unfortunately, this study found that outpatient diabetes patients had insufficient knowledge, practice, and a negative attitude toward diabetes type 2. This imposes a great burden on healthcare workers and hence the healthcare system to improve patient scores via diabetes education programs or pharmacist-led patient counseling initiatives.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Safe and effective long-acting agents for HIV prevention are needed for women. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of injectable cabotegravir compared with daily oral tenofovir diphosphate plus emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) for HIV prevention in HIV-uninfected women. METHODS HPTN 084 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, superiority trial in 20 clinical research sites in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were eligible for enrolment if they were assigned female sex at birth, were aged 18-45 years, reported at least two episodes of vaginal intercourse in the previous 30 days, were at risk of HIV infection based on an HIV risk score, and agreed to use a long-acting reversible contraceptive method. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either active cabotegravir with TDF-FTC placebo (cabotegravir group) or active TDF-FTC with cabotegravir placebo (TDF-FTC group). Study staff and participants were masked to study group allocation, with the exception of the site pharmacist who was responsible for study product preparation. Participants were prescribed 5 weeks of daily oral product followed by intramuscular injections every 8 weeks after an initial 4-week interval load, alongside daily oral pills. Participants who discontinued injections were offered open-label daily TDF-FTC for 48 weeks. The primary endpoints of the study were incident HIV infection in the intention-to-treat population, and clinical and laboratory events that were grade 2 or higher in all women who had received at least one dose of study product. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03164564. FINDINGS From Nov 27, 2017, to Nov 4, 2020, we enrolled 3224 participants (1614 in the cabotegravir group and 1610 in the TDF-FTC group). Median age was 25 years (IQR 22-30); 1755 (54·7%) of 3209 had two or more partners in the preceding month. 40 incident infections were observed over 3898 person-years (HIV incidence 1·0% [95% CI 0·73-1·40]); four in the cabotegravir group (HIV incidence 0·2 cases per 100 person-years [0·06-0·52]) and 36 in the TDF-FTC group (1·85 cases per 100 person-years [1·3-2·57]; hazard ratio 0·12 [0·05-0·31]; p<0·0001; risk difference -2% [-1·3% to -2·7%]). In a random subset of 405 TDF-FTC participants, 812 (42·1%) of 1929 plasma samples had tenofovir concentrations consistent with daily use. Injection coverage was 93% of the total number of person-years. Adverse event rates were similar across both groups, apart from injection site reactions, which were more frequent in the cabotegravir group than in the TDF-FTC group (577 [38·0%] of 1519 vs 162 [10·7%] of 1516]) but did not result in injection discontinuation. Confirmed pregnancy incidence was 1·3 per 100 person-years (0·9-1·7); no congenital birth anomalies were reported. INTERPRETATION Although both products for HIV prevention were generally safe, well tolerated, and effective, cabotegravir was superior to TDF-FTC in preventing HIV infection in women.

1632,35378673,"Experiences and opinions of multi-professional non-medical oncology prescribers on post-qualification training: a qualitative study. BACKGROUND Within the UK, a non-medical prescriber is a non-medical healthcare professional who has undertaken post-registration training to gain prescribing rights. Lack of post-qualification NMP training has previously been identified as a barrier to the development of oncology non-medical prescribing practice. AIM To explore the experiences and opinions of multi-professional non-medical oncology prescribers on post-qualification training. METHOD Nine out of 30 oncology non-medical prescribers (three nurses, three pharmacists and three radiographers) from a single cancer centre in Wales, were selected from a study site NMP database using randomisation sampling within Microsoft® Excel. Participants were interviewed using a validated and piloted semi-structured interview design on the topic of post-qualification training for non-medical prescribers. Participants were invited via organisational email. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Anonymised data were thematically analysed aided by NVivo® software. RESULTS Main themes identified: experience related to training, competency, support and training methods. Competency assessment methods discussed were the annual non-medical prescriber appraisal, peer review and a line manager's overarching appraisal. Support requirements identified included greater consultant input to help non-medical prescribers identify training and peer support opportunities. Organisational support was requested regarding regular study leave and governance around clinical judgement and errors. The need for regular structured in-house training related to non-medical prescriber's level of experience was identified. CONCLUSION Development of organisation-led governance strategies and in-house training programmes will support training equity for all non-medical prescribers within the organisation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1633,35379027,"Developing Medication Therapy Management Training for Community Health Professionals Serving Low-Income Patients. BACKGROUND Each year, medication-related adverse events account for over 1 million emergency department visits according to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Medication therapy management (MTM), a service most commonly performed by health professionals, identifies and resolves medication-related problems and has been shown to both reduce healthcare costs and improve clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE The objective of our project was to expand the use of MTM by developing a training program for health professionals to increase medication adherence for low-income patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) specifically targeting individuals with hypertension and diabetes. METHODS A needs assessment survey was developed and administered to licensed pharmacists across the state of Florida. Based on the results of the survey, an MTM training program was developed to support pharmacists who serve patients with hypertension and diabetes. The second phase included a pre-assessment administered to the FQHC. The training program was modified based on responses to the pre-assessment. RESULTS Based on the FQHC pre-assessment, the team developed MTM support training for health professionals that included 7 modules. These modules were Principles of Chronic Disease Self-Management, Team-Based Care, Client Self-Advocacy, Health Equity, Cultural Competency, Social Determinants of Health, and the Benefits of MTM Services. CONCLUSION Expanding MTM support training to other health professionals is expected to provide greater access to chronic disease management support, improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care for patients. It is also expected over time to reduce the demand for additional chronic disease-related services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To describe the evolution of our Pharmacy Service in relation to the  objectives of Proyecto 2020 (Project 2020) of the Sociedad Española  Farmacia Hospitalaria (Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy), to identify weak  points, and to implement improvement actions to achieve the set  objectives. METHOD A 10-year prospective observational study. We analysed the initial  situation of the Pharmacy Service and conducted follow-up reassessments. We  developed a questionnaire comprising the 28 goals of the five strategic focus  reas (blocks) of the project based on a 4-level quantitative classification of  these goals: level A, implementation in all areas (3 points); level B,  mplementation in some areas (2 points); level C, not implemented, but  formally discussed (1 point); or level D, not addressed (0 points). After each  assessment, we identified the goals with the lowest scores and determined  which improvement actions needed to be implemented. After each assessment,  the targets with lower score were identified and improvement  actions needed to be implemented were decided. Results: The initial assessment was conducted in 2010. The overall score was  42/84 and the highest score (7/9) related to the block scientific evidence. The  follow-up reassessments (2014, 2019) and the final one (2020) showed an  overall gradual increase in level A scores (18% vs 53%) and a  decrease in  level C (43% vs 4%) and D objectives (14% vs 4%). All blocks improved their  score, obtaining a final score of 68/84 (31% increase). A total of 18 weak  points were identified and appropriate improvement actions were implemented,  which included automation, quality management, the creation  of multidisciplinary working groups, the prevention of medication errors, the  incorporation of intelligent pumps or therapeutic drug monitoring among other  solutions. CONCLUSIONS Projects promoted by scientific societies help to prioritize improvement actions in health organizations that contribute to  improve their quality.

1635,35379090,"Use of cyclodextrins as excipients in pharmaceutical products: why not in extemporaneous preparations? OBJECTIVE To conduct an assessment of cyclodextrins used as excipients in  pharmaceutical formulations, considering compounding,  iopharmaceuticalpharmacokinetic, toxicological, regulatory, economic and  commercial aspects. METHODS A literature search was performed of highly cited review and original articles. Regulatory and legislative documents and well-established pharmacopoeias were also consulted. RESULTS Solubility, resistance to hydrolysis and complexation efficiency are  variables that depend on the cyclodextrin itself and on the drug to be complexed. In some cases, addition of excipients is necessary to improve complexation efficiency. Complexation of drugs with cyclodextrins at laboratory scale tends to be rather inconsistent. Moreover, wide variations exist for the same cyclodextrin across different suppliers and even across batches from the same supplier. This means more control analyses must be carried out of pharmaceutical preparations. Problems with  the stability of cyclodextrin-drug complexes could affect the oral bioavailability of the drugs. Additionally, some cyclodextrins may optimize the  drug's permeability through specific biological membranes and the length of  time it remains in contact with them. Despite the safety profile of  cyclodextrins, exceeding certain dosing thresholds and administration times  might cause adverse effects. Only cyclodextrins recognized as excipients by  well-esta blished pharmacopeias should be used in pharmaceutical  compounding. Cyclodextrins lead to an increase in the global costs of  compounding and their purchase through recognized suppliers is often  unfeasible. CONCLUSIONS Despite their interesting properties as excipients due to inclusion  complex formation, the need to carry out more quality control analyses and stability constant studies, combined with the high cost  and difficulty to purchase cyclodextrins, may explain why their use in  pharmaceutical compounding is currently not a viable alternative.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of loss-of-function variants in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene in patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms, assess their clinical relevance, and evaluate the  implementation of a multidisciplinary circuit at three months from its  implementation. METHOD This is a descriptive, observational and retrospective study, which  included adult patients with gastrointestinal cancer treated at a tertiary  university hospital who underwent dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase genotyping between September 2019 and December 2020. The  variables collected were sex, age, type of cancer, location, stage, treatment received, indication of treatment and degree of toxicity  developed during the first three cycles. The genotyped variants were  rs3918290 (c.1905+1G&gt;A), rs55886062 (c.1679T&gt;G), rs67376798  (c.2846A&gt;T) and rs75017182 (c.1129-5923C&gt;G). RESULTS A total of 115 patients were included. The frequency of heterozygous dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase variant carriers was 9.6% (11  patients). The most frequently identified variant was rs75017182 (6 patients). The second most common variant was rs67376798 (3 patients),  followed by rs3918290 (2 patients). No patients presented with the  rs55886062 variant. Two of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase carriers  developed  grade 3-5 toxicity after the first cycle of a regimen that included  fluoropyrimidines. Both received full doses of fluoropyrimidine, since their  dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase genotype was unknown before treatment  initiation. None of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase carriers who began treatment with a reduced dose of fluoropyrimidine experienced grade 3-5  toxicity. Since the creation in October 2020 of a multidisciplinary team, with  the active participation of hospital pharmacists, the monthly average of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase genotyping studies has increased from 6.4  (January-October) to 17.5 (November-December). CONCLUSIONS The present study shows a relatively high prevalence of loss-of- function variants in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene as well as the  importance of genotyping such variants before starting a treatment with  fluoropyrimidines.

OBJECTIVE Personalized therapy in the treatment of infections is essential to  ensure optimization of antimicrobial drug levels. This strategy, together with an  understanding of the activity of these drugs, decreases the risk of bacterial  resistance and improves the drugs' safety profile. Alternative  outes of administration, such as inhalation, and the information provided by  pharmacokinetic models, are essential given the limitation of antimicrobial  activity allowed by the new antimicrobials. METHOD A non-systematic review of the literature is presented as a way of  tackling and finding solutions to the problem. A search for high-quality articles  on the research topic was conducted. Results: A total of 370 articles were  detected, which were subjected to a further selection to discard low quality  papers by a team of five clinical pharmacists and an intensivist. Finally, 153  articles were included in the review. CONCLUSIONS The geriatric and the critical care patient population require the  administration of antimicrobials with close monitoring. The routes of  administration recommended for the first group are discouraged for the  second. The inhaled route often results in high plasma concentrations in  patients with respiratory infections.

OBJECTIVE The goal of this article is to analyze the situation of  harmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics units in the pharmacy departments of  Spanish hospitals, evaluate their development both in the clinical and educational areas, and draw up a map reflecting their current status.  Method: A 29-item survey structured in five blocks was designed with general questions about the respondents' hospital and the clinical and educational activities carried out by their pharmacy department, in the fields of both pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics. RESULTS Sixty-nine  hospitals answered the survey. The highest response rates corresponded to  Catalonia, the Valencia region and Andalusia. The drug families subject to closest monitoring were classic antibiotics (93%), digoxin (57%), classic antiepileptics  (51%) and biologicals (43%). The most frequently used computer programs  included PKS and NONMEM (93% and 22% of hospitals, respectively).  Regarding training in pharmacokinetics, second year residents were those who  most frequently rotated through the pharmacokinetics unit (40%), while 44%  of those units allowed external residents. As far as pharmacogenetics is  concerned, in 42% of hospitals that engaged in pharmacogenetic work, the  department in charge was pharmacy. The most frequent specialties covered  were hemato-oncology (72%) and psychiatry (15%). Twenty-four percent of  hospitals offered rotations through their pharmacogenetics unit but only seven of them allowed external residents. CONCLUSIONS The results of the survey showed an increase in the  erformance of pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic activities by Spanish hospital pharmacies as compared with the data from a 2009 baseline  survey, with many hospitals introducing the performance of therapeutic drug monitoring of non-classical antibiotics, immunosuppressants and biologics. However, the percentage of hospitals that follow the ideal model based on analytical determinations and pharmacokinetic reporting has decreased the data obtained served as a basis to create an updated map of the  harmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics units operating in Spanish hospital  pharmacy departments.

BACKGROUND We report thea case of a 43-year-old Chinese male with tophaceous gout who had been living in our country for some years. CASE PRESENTATION Previous treatments with allopurinol had induced Steven Johnson syndrome, dictating a switch to febuxostat 80 mg daily. After two years of treatment with febuxostat, he developed a diffuse maculopapular rash with severe itching. Rheumatologists stopped the febuxostat but the gout worsened over the following years despite of treatment with kalnicitrate and colchicine. Therefore, an allergy consultation was called for. A slow desensitization protocol with febuxostat was started, with a low oral dosage scheme to be increased up to 80mg/day. Febuxostat was prepared in a solid formulation by the pharmacist as pills, instead of the more frequently used liquid suspension. CONCLUSION The patient is currently receivinges febuxostat 80 mg, shows no side effects and his gout has improved.

1643,35379307,"A deprescribing medication program to evaluate falls in older adults: methods for a randomized pragmatic clinical trial. BACKGROUND Opioids and benzodiazepines (BZDs) are some of the most commonly prescribed medications that contribute to falls in older adults. These medications are challenging to appropriately prescribe and monitor, with little guidance on safe prescribing of these medications for older patients. Only a handful of small studies have evaluated whether reducing opioid and BZD use through deprescribing has a positive impact on outcomes. Leveraging the strengths of a large health system, we evaluated the impact of a targeted consultant pharmacist intervention to deprescribe opioids and BZDs for older adults seen in primary care practices in North Carolina. METHODS We developed a toolkit and process for deprescribing opioids and BZDs in older adults based on a literature review and guidance from an interprofessional team of pharmacists, geriatricians, and investigators. A total of fifteen primary care practices have been randomized to receive the targeted consultant pharmacist service (n = 8) or usual care (n = 7). The intervention consists of several components: (1) weekly automated reports to identify chronic users of opioids and BZDs, (2) clinical pharmacist medication review, and (3) recommendations for deprescribing and/or alternate therapies routed to prescribers through the electronic health record. We will collect data for all patients presenting one of the primary care clinics who meet the criteria for chronic use of opioids and/or BZDs, based on their prescription order history. We will use the year prior to evaluate baseline medication exposures using morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) and diazepam milligram equivalents (DMEs). In the year following the intervention, we will evaluate changes in medication exposures and medication discontinuations between control and intervention clinics. Incident falls will be evaluated as a secondary outcome. To date, the study has enrolled 914 chronic opioid users and 1048 chronic BZD users. We anticipate that we will have 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in MMEs or DMEs. DISCUSSION This clinic randomized pragmatic trial will contribute valuable evidence regarding the impact of pharmacist interventions to reduce falls in older adults through deprescribing of opioids and BZDs in primary care settings.

1644,35379559,"Rethinking the gold standard - The feasibility of randomized controlled trials within health services effectiveness research. BACKGROUND An evidence-based randomized controlled trial for a novel Pharmacy Asthma Service was tested in 3 Australian states. Positive asthma outcomes were achieved after the 12-month intervention, albeit in both the intervention and comparator arms. The current investigation uses a mixed methods approach to 1) qualitatively explore how comparator arm pharmacists implemented the trial protocol and 2) quantitatively examine how this may have impacted patient outcomes in this trial. METHODS Post-intervention semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 pharmacists, representing 21 of 37 (57%) comparator arm pharmacies that completed the trial. Based on these interviews, pharmacies were classified as 'adherent' to the trial protocol (reporting no interventions other than general practitioner referral) or 'non-adherent' (reporting at least one extra intervention to the trial protocol), or 'inconclusive'. These subgroups were compared descriptively in relation to patient outcomes. RESULTS Overall, 33% (n = 8/24) of the comparator pharmacies who were interviewed (n = 21) or determined to have monitoring by a project officer to ensure adherence to the protocol (n = 3) were classified as adherent), 58% (n = 14/24) as non-adherent, 8% inconclusive (n = 2/24). While all patients commenced with uncontrolled asthma (Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ) > 1.5), after 12 months the mean ACQ score for patients from adherent comparator pharmacies ('true control') was 1.8 (still uncontrolled asthma) compared to a score of 1.4 (controlled asthma) in the non-adherent comparator group. Quality of life significantly improved in the non-adherent comparator group over the 12 months of the trial. CONCLUSION The majority of pharmacists in the comparator arm who were interviewed, introduced their own interventions, which may have influenced the outcomes of the trial. The naturalistic setting of the study was not protective against these confounders. These findings question the feasibility of comparator arms within primary care settings and that alternative study designs should be considered when designing future intervention studies in pharmacy practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND COVID-19 has necessitated a change to the way pharmacists are providing healthcare and has impacted the psychological wellbeing of these frontline healthcare workers. OBJECTIVE To use the job demands-resources framework of burnout to describe the experiences of pharmacists working during COVID-19. METHODS An online survey investigating burnout, psychosocial, and work-related factors affecting pharmacists during COVID-19 was distributed to a convenience sample of pharmacists practising in Australia during April and June 2020. The survey was distributed via social media and professional organisations. This study was a thematic analysis of the free-text question of the survey that asked participants to provide comment on anything they considered important. The job demands-resources framework of burnout was applied to the themes. RESULTS Of 647 total survey responses, 215 (33.2%) participants responded to the free text question. Thematic analysis explored the increase in demands on pharmacists with a decreased availability of resources during COVID-19. Themes associated with high demands included an increased workload, provision of education and support to the community, taking on roles traditionally performed by others, managing medication and stock supply issues, and poor consumer behaviour. Themes representing resources, which were inadequate, included feeling supported by management and colleagues, feeling adequately trained, receiving clear and consistent communication, feeling valued and appreciated, personal safety, and recovery time. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists have experienced increased demands and reduced resources during COVID-19 which is associated with burnout. Knowledge of these demands and resources can inform interventions at an individual, workplace, and external level.

BACKGROUND Oral over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium are widely used to treat pain. Although generally considered safe, inappropriate use can lead to injury. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to explore patient attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about the efficacy and potential risks of oral OTC analgesics and to identify factors that adult patients use to make decisions about these medications. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Embase to identify studies published in English between January 2000 and June 2019. We included randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that included OTC analgesics. Authors worked independently during study selection, data extraction, and analysis and then compared their findings and discussed discrepancies until consensus was reached. We evaluated study quality using the Study Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal of a Cross-Sectional Study. RESULTS We identified 10,898 unique articles, of which 53 were included in this systematic review. A total of 36 studies included acetaminophen, 25 included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 19 did not specify a product. Adults had mixed perceptions about the effectiveness of analgesics. Knowledge of the risks of high doses of acetaminophen (liver toxicity) and NSAIDs (gastrointestinal bleeding or nephrotoxicity) was generally low and declined with less formal education. Individuals with severe or recurrent pain were more likely to exceed the maximum recommended dose of the medication. Although participants reported considering a variety of factors when deciding between different OTC analgesics, there was no clear medication that was generally preferred. Our review was comprehensive; however, the quality of the studies was generally good to fair. CONCLUSION Adults frequently use oral OTC analgesics and possess a diverse set of beliefs about the efficacy and safety of the products.

Background Polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events in older people. Although national guidance on geriatric pharmacotherapy exists in Japan, tools to routinely monitor the quality of care provided by community pharmacists are lacking. Aim To develop a set of quality indicators (QIs) to measure the quality of care provided by community pharmacists in improving geriatric pharmacotherapy in primary care in Japan, using a modified Delphi study. Method The development of QIs for the Japanese community pharmacy context followed a two-step process: national guidance review and consensus testing using a modified Delphi study. The latter involved two rounds of rating with a face-to-face meeting between the rounds. Ten experts in geriatric pharmacotherapy in primary care were recruited for the panel discussion. QIs were mapped to three key taxonomies and frameworks: the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, problems and causes of drug-related problems (DRPs) taxonomy and Donabedian's framework. Results A total of 134 QIs for geriatric pharmacotherapy were developed. This QI set included 111 medicine specific indicators, covering medicines in 243 third-level ATC classifications. QIs were classified into the problem of treatment safety (80%) and causes of drug selection (38%) based on validated classification for DRPs. In Donabedian's framework, most QIs (82%) were process indicators. There were no structure indicators. Conclusion A set of 134 QIs for geriatric pharmacotherapy was rigorously developed.

1653,35382725,"The sustainability of the impact of clinical pharmacists' educational programs on the adherence to the recommendations of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. INTRODUCTION This study was designed to evaluate the sustainability of the impact of educational programs provided by pharmacists on the appropriateness of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis and cost-savings in a short time and a long time after the intervention. METHODS AND MATERIALS This prospective educational interventional study was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital for surgery in the West of Iran from September 2018 to October 2019. The study was designed in three phases: pre-intervention phase, short term after the intervention, and six months after the intervention. Within a one month course, several educational sessions regarding the appropriate preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis based on the recommendations of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guideline (ASHPs) were provided by a clinical pharmacist in an interactive manner for the surgeons. The appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis regarding the necessity for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis use (indication), the choice of antibiotic, the timing of antibiotic administration, the route of administration, the dose of antibiotics, and the total duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was evaluated and compared before and after the educational intervention. Additionally, medication-related costs, non-medication-related costs, antibiotic prophylaxis-related costs, and total costs of care were also assessed before and after the educational intervention. RESULTS Our survey showed that total adherence to the guideline recommendations among surgeons in our center was relatively low, and in 71.8% of procedures, at least in one of the quality indicators, non-adherence to the guideline recommendations was observed. After the educational intervention, a significant improvement in the rationality of antibiotic prophylaxis, in terms of not administrating antibiotic prophylaxis in procedures without indication, appropriate timing of administration, appropriate antibiotic dose, and appropriate duration of antibiotic prophylaxis, especially in the short time after the intervention was observed that ultimately reduced the medication, non-medication, antibiotic prophylaxis related, and total therapeutic costs. CONCLUSIONS Our survey showed that educational interventions provided by pharmacists in an interactive manner could improve guideline recommendations' adherence among surgeons, particularly in a short time. Thus, continuous education still should be considered as an essential element of a multifaceted intervention for improving guideline adherence.",0,0,1,1,1,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
1654,35382881,"Effectiveness of pharmacist intervention for deprescribing potentially inappropriate medications: a prospective observational study. BACKGROUND Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and polypharmacy in older adults lead to increase the risk of adverse drug events. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist intervention combining the criteria for detecting PIMs with the deprescribing algorithm on correcting PIMs, reducing the number of medications, and readmissions. METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted at a Japanese University Hospital enrolling new inpatients aged ≥65 years prescribed ≥1 daily medication. Pharmacists detected PIMs based on the criteria combined the screening tool of older persons' potentially inappropriate prescriptions criteria version 2 with the screening tool for older persons' appropriate prescriptions for Japanese, examined changes using the deprescribing algorithm, and suggested changes to the physician. The proportion of patients whose number of medications was reduced at discharge and the rate of readmissions within 30 and 90 days were compared between patients without PIMs (without PIMs group), patients who were not suggested to change PIMs (no suggestions group), and patients who were suggested to change PIMs (suggested group). RESULTS The study enrolled 544 patients (median age 75.0 years, 54.4% males, median number of medications 6.0/patient). The number of patients with PIMs was 240 (44.1%), and 304 patients had no PIMs (without PIMs group). Among the patients with PIMs, 125 (52.1%) patients received pharmacist suggestions to change ≥1 PIMs (suggested group), and 115 patients received no suggestions for change (no suggestions group). The total number of PIMs was 432, of which changes were suggested for 189 (43.8%). Of these 189 cases, 172 (91.0%) were changed. The proportion of patients whose number of medications was reduced was significantly higher in the suggested group than in the without PIMs group and the no suggestions group [56.8% (71/125) vs. 26.6% (81/304) and 19.1% (22/115), respectively; P < 0.001 in both comparisons]. There were no significant differences in the rates of readmissions within 30 and 90 days among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacist intervention combining the criteria for detecting PIMs with the deprescribing algorithm was effective for correcting PIMs and may be associated with a reduction in the number of medications.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Geriatric,,,,Inpatient,
1655,35382984,"Telehealth diabetes services for non-English speaking patients. BACKGROUND Several studies have shown the use of telehealth in diabetes management to be as efficacious as traditional clinic visits; however, these studies focused on English-speaking populations. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether telehealth is an effective approach for participation in pharmacist collaborative diabetes management services among non-English-speaking or limited English proficiency (LEP) patients at a federally qualified health center (FQHC). The secondary objective was to evaluate glycated hemoglobin (A1c) as a clinical outcome in patients participating in telehealth versus in-person visits. METHODS This study was a retrospective chart review. Patients were non-English-speaking or LEP adults (≥ 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes (T2D) referred for pharmacist collaborative diabetes management services by a medical provider. This study reviewed patient participation and A1c values over 6 months (May to October) of 2 consecutive years (2019 and 2020). RESULTS In this study, 40 patients in 2019 and 50 patients in 2020 met the inclusion criteria. In 2019, the primary visit model was in-person and 123 total visits were scheduled with a pharmacist. In 2020, the primary visit model was telehealth and 143 total visits were scheduled. In 2019, there were 28 no-show visits, which accounted for 22.8% of total visits. In 2020, there were 27 no-show visits, which accounted for 18.9% of total visits. The mean change in A1c from baseline to follow-up was found to decrease by 1.0% in 2019 and 0.95% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that telehealth participation in pharmacist-provided collaborative T2D services and decrease in A1c were similar during telehealth compared with in-person visits among non-English-speaking and LEP patients at a FQHC. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to determine the overall impact of telehealth in non-English-speaking or LEP patients.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,

OBJECTIVE(S) The objective of the study was to validate a clinical aid to guide the assessment and management of a patient's listed beta-lactam antibiotic allergy for use in rural areas of Australia. DESIGN Rural generalists, pharmacists and junior doctors completed an online assessment of eight patient case studies using the tool. SETTING The study was conducted in the Southern Downs, QLD. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-seven rural generalists, nine pharmacists and eight junior doctors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The sensitivity of the selected allergy phenotype and management option for each case study was calculated by profession and overall. Hazardous responses were reported by management category and profession. RESULTS The sensitivity overall for phenotype selection was 82.4% (95% CI, 78.0-86.2) and for management 88.1% (95% CI, 84.2-91.2). The sensitivity for phenotype selection was lower for junior doctors than other professions 73.4% (95% CI, 60.9-83.7), but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). A total of 10/308 responses for management recommended the least restrictive option of direct delabelling or oral challenge, where the correct answer was skin prick testing or referral to an allergist. CONCLUSION(S) With further education the tool could be a key component of increased antimicrobial stewardship in rural areas in Australia.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1657,35384685,"Clinical associates and access to healthcare in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. BACKGROUND  Clinical associates (ClinAs) were introduced into South Africa as part of the remedy for the severe shortage of healthcare workers in rural areas. Walter Sisulu University (WSU) graduated 100 ClinAs between 2011 and 2014. These ClinAs were expected to be based at district hospitals where they would work under the supervision of doctors, reduce the workload of doctors and increase access to healthcare in the Eastern Cape. AIM  This study aimed to examine the role played by ClinAs in healthcare delivery in Eastern Cape district hospitals, and to determine whether the training of ClinAs adequately prepared them for this role. SETTING  The study was conducted in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa amongst ClinAs who graduated from WSU between 2011 and 2014, and healthcare workers from Madzikane KaZulu Memorial Hospital. METHODS  This was an exploratory cross-sectional mixed methods study with a convergent design. Surveys and in-depth interviews were conducted amongst ClinAs, nurses, doctors and one pharmacist. Both qualitative and quantitative data were analysed and reported. RESULTS  Clinical associates are seen to improve the workload of doctors, and to increase access to healthcare. Thirty-four percent of ClinAs were no longer contributing to healthcare in the Eastern Cape. CONCLUSION  Clinical associates are making a significant contribution to access to healthcare in the Eastern Cape. Their supervision regimen needs to be revisited and factors that contribute to the attrition of ClinAs in the Eastern Cape need to be addressed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1658,35385110,"Research progress on the pharmacy of tetramethylpyrazine and its pharmacological activity in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. OBJECTIVES The role and mechanism of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) in cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs), as well as the research of its new formulations are reviewed, which provides a new strategy for the clinical application of TMP. METHODS We searched the databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and CNKI for relevant literature from 1991 to 2021 by searching for the keywords ""TMP"", ""ligustrazine"", ""cardiovascular disease"" and ""nanoformulation"". The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) the literature is an experimental article, (2) the article studies cardiovascular and cerebrovascular-related diseases and (3) the article also includes the pharmacy research of TMP. A total of 160 articles were screened. KEY FINDINGS TMP has various pharmacological effects in the treatment of many CCVDs, such as atherosclerosis, myocardium, cerebral ischemia, reperfusion injury and hypertension. Its protective effects are mainly related to its anti-platelet activity, protection of endothelial cells, and anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. In addition to pharmacological activity studies, the information of the new formulations is also significant for the further development and utilization of TMP. CONCLUSIONS Above all, TMP can protect cardio-cerebro vessels, and preparing new formulations can improve its bioavailability, indicating that TMP has broad prospects in the treatment of CCVDs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1659,35387329,"Medication-Related Readmissions: Documentation of the Medication Involved and Communication in the Care Continuum.  Background: Of all readmissions, 21% are medication-related readmissions (MRRs). However, it is unknown whether MRRs are recognized at the time of readmission and are communicated in the care continuum. Objectives: To identify the prevalence of MRRs that contain a documentation on the medication involved (and therefore are regarded as recognized), and the proportion of communicated MRRs. Setting: The study was performed in a teaching hospital. Methods: In a previous study, a multidisciplinary team of physicians and pharmacists assessed the medication-relatedness, the medication involved and preventability of unplanned readmissions from seven departments. In the current cross-sectional study, two pharmacy team members evaluated the patient records independently. An MRR was regarded as recognized when the medication involved was documented in patient records. An MRR was regarded as communicated to the patient and/or the next healthcare provider when the medication involved or a description was mentioned in discharge letters or discharge prescriptions. The relationship between documented MRRs and whether the MRR was preventable as well as the relationship between (un)documented MRRs and the length of stay (LOS) were assessed. Descriptive data analysis was used. Results: Of 181 included MRRs, 72 (40%) were deemed preventable by the multidisciplinary team. For 159 of 181 MRRs (88%), a documentation on the medication involved was present. Of 159 documented MRRs, 93 (58%) were communicated to patients and/or caregivers, 137 (86%) to the general practitioner, and 4 (3%) to the community pharmacy. The medication involved was documented less often for potentially preventable MRRs than for non-preventable MRRs (78 vs. 95%; p = 0.002). The LOS was longer for MRRs where the medication involved was undocumented (median 8 vs. 5 days; p = 0.062). Conclusion: The results of this study imply that MRRs are not always recognized, which could impact patients' well-being. In this study an increased LOS was observed with unrecognized MRRs. Communication of MRRs to the patients and/or the next healthcare providers should be improved.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1661,35387369,"Methods of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring to Guide Vancomycin Dosing Regimens: Trough Concentration versus Ratio of Area Under the Curve to Minimum Inhibitory Concentration. Background The most recent vancomycin monitoring guideline recommends targeting a value for area under the curve (AUC) of 400 to 600 mg*h/L, with an assumed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1 mg/L. Few studies have investigated the effect of this method on vancomycin dosing regimens, relative to a target trough concentration of 15 to 20 mg/L. Objective To compare vancomycin dosing regimens generated with the 2 monitoring methods. Methods This retrospective chart review included hospitalized patients who received vancomycin between May 2019 and April 2020. The dosing regimens were compared, with the paired Student t test, in terms of unit dose, daily dose, and dosing interval. Variables of interest were collected from electronic medical charts. A pharmacy resident used first-order pharmacokinetic equations to determine dosing regimens based on AUC monitoring. Local pharmacists retrospectively determined dosing regimens for trough-based monitoring. Results Of 100 courses of treatment initially identified, 66 were included in the analysis. The unit dose was similar with the 2 methods (1086 mg with AUC-based monitoring versus 1100 mg with trough-based monitoring; p = 0.62). AUC monitoring was associated with a 12.8% lower daily dose (2294 mg versus 2630 mg; p < 0.001) and a 13.5% longer dosing interval (13.24 h versus 11.67 h; p < 0.001) relative to trough-based monitoring. AUC monitoring also generated a lower extrapolated trough concentration (12.90 mg/L versus 16.22 mg/L; p < 0.001). Conclusions A target trough concentration of 15 to 20 mg/L was confirmed as being unnecessarily high. AUC monitoring could allow a reduction in daily vancomycin dose and an extension of the dosing interval relative to trough-based monitoring.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1663,35387374,"Ambulatory Heart Function and Transplant Patients' Perceptions of Drug-Drug Interactions: A Qualitative Study. Background Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can cause adverse drug events, leading to hospitalizations and an increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality. Until now, patients' perceptions of DDIs have represented an understudied area of research. Objectives To explore patients' perceptions of DDIs and identify factors important to patients' understanding of their medications. Methods Participants were recruited from 2 ambulatory clinics (heart function and transplant) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Participants engaged in key informant interviews and were asked to provide their demographic information, rate their understanding of their own medications, and define a DDI. Afterward, participants were interviewed to gather their perceptions of DDIs and factors important to their understanding of their medications. Results A total of 7 patients were recruited. Participants struggled to define a DDI and were unsure if they had ever experienced a DDI. There was a reliance on health care professionals to help manage DDIs. Participants did not identify barriers preventing them from accessing medication information from health care professionals; however, they independently sought medication information found on the internet. Conclusions Patients in this study had an incomplete understanding of DDIs and had difficulties differentiating DDIs from side effects of medications. As a result of their limited understanding of DDIs, patients relied on health care professionals to inform and manage their DDIs. Although patients did not identify barriers to accessing medication information, their pervasive use of the internet suggests that there are unidentified barriers preventing patients from speaking directly to their health care professionals regarding their medication therapy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1664,35387375,"Reasons for Low Regulatory Body Discipline Rates for Canadian Hospital Pharmacists. Background Past research on disciplinary action by pharmacist regulatory bodies has shown that most cases concern community pharmacists, with few occurring in a hospital setting. Objective To investigate how discipline-related issues involving pharmacists are dealt with by hospital pharmacy departments in Canada. Methods Hospital pharmacy directors and managers from small, medium, and large hospitals across Canada were invited to participate in semi-structured telephone interviews. The interview questions focused on the discipline process in participants' organizations, the situations when reporting to the regulatory body is deemed to be warranted, possible penalties, and recommendations for improving the regulatory body or organizational discipline process. Results Ten participants, from British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, agreed to be interviewed. Five key themes emerged as contributing to lower rates of hospital pharmacist discipline cases being escalated to the regulatory college level: robust organizational discipline processes independent from the regulatory college, a practice environment promoting competence, union representation, preference for a remedial approach to discipline, and lack of clarity about when to report to the regulatory authority. Conclusions This study identified a number of reasons why discipline of hospital pharmacists by a regulatory body may be less prevalent than discipline relating to community pharmacists. The main reasons may be lack of clarity about when to report a case to the regulator and a lack of transparency, given that many cases are handled internally within hospitals. Environmental supports for competence and employee protections (e.g., through a union) may also reduce discipline cases.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1666,35387377,"Assessment of Intravenous versus Oral Antimicrobials in a Large Regional Health Authority. Background Many antimicrobials given by the intravenous (IV) route have oral (PO) formulations with high oral bioavailability. The advantages of using the PO rather than the IV formulation include lower risk of adverse reactions, shorter length of hospital stay, and lower health care costs. Objectives The primary objective was to determine the proportions of patients who received the IV and PO formulations of antimicrobials with high oral bioavailability. The secondary objectives were to determine the proportion of patients who were eligible to receive PO antimicrobials from the start of treatment, the proportion who qualified for IV-to-PO step-down, and areas of improvement to increase use of PO antimicrobials. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted in hospitals in the Fraser Health Authority, British Columbia, between October 18, 2019, and March 5, 2020. Two hundred charts were randomly selected for patients who had received either azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fluconazole, levofloxacin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, metronidazole, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, or voriconazole. Results Of the 200 patients, 124 (62.0%) received the PO formulations, while 76 (38.0%) received the IV formulations. Of the 76 patients receiving IV antimicrobials, 39 (51.3%; 95% confidence interval 44.7%-57.9%) were eligible to receive PO antimicrobials from the start of treatment or could have been stepped down from IV to PO administration. Conclusions More than half of patients who received IV therapy were eligible to receive the PO formulation of antimicrobials known to have high oral bioavailability; relative to earlier studies, this proportion has not improved over time. This finding highlights the need for continued vigilance in encouraging the use of PO rather than IV formulations for hospitalized patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Inappropriate use of narcotic drugs is a growing worldwide health challenge. The problem is even worse in Sub-Saharan Africa where organized supply chain regulations on dispensing and stock management are poor for controlling these global challenges. METHODS A mixed method, descriptive cross-sectional and simulated client study design was used from September 10, 2020 to November 26, 2020 to assess the extent of utilization and compliance of narcotic drug dispensing in private pharmacy retail outlets of Gondar and Bahir Dar town of Amhara region, Ethiopia. A total of 107 private pharmacy outlets were on duty. But in simulated study, purposive sampling is a method that prioritizes study units having the data of interest. RESULTS A total of 107 private pharmacy retails outlets were included in the survey. The average compliance to the controlled prescription regulation of Ethiopia in all pharmacy outlets (107) of the five drugs were calculated and found to be poor, 23.9% (SD = 18.3%). Compliance to strong narcotics is extremely low, 3.3 % for pethidine and 8% for morphine. Religion of the professionals has significant association with compliance to the prescription of narcotic drugs (p < .001). DISCUSSION In the era of narcotic epidemics, as a result of growing global inappropriate use of controlled drugs, the finding of this study gives an insight for a serious and strict regulation in managing and controlling the overall distribution of the narcotic drugs.

1670,35387676,"Improving safety and efficacy with pharmacist medication reconciliation in orthopedic joint surgery within an enhanced recovery after surgery program. PURPOSE To investigate the impact of medication reconciliation (MR), through avoidance of unintentional medication discrepancies, on enhanced recovery after surgery programs designed for older patients undergoing orthopedic joint surgery.  METHOD: Our study was divided into two phases. In the first phase, MR was performed for elderly patients undergoing orthopedic joint surgery. Types of medication discrepancies and their potential risks were analyzed. In the second phase, a controlled study was conducted in a subgroup of patients diagnosed with periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) and who were scheduled for two-stage revision. The primary goal was to investigate the impact of MR on length of stay for the first stage. The secondary goal was to investigate the time between the first admission and the reimplantation of a new prosthesis, the number of readmissions within 30 days, hospitalization cost. RESULTS A total of 506 medication discrepancies were identified in the included 260 patients. Intolerance had the highest incidence (n = 131, 25.7%). The Bayliff tool showed that 71.9% were assessed as level 2 risk, and 10.3% had a life-threatening risk. For patients with PJI, MR reduced the average length of stay in the first stage (16.3 days vs. 20.7 days, P = 0.03) and shortened the time (57.3 days vs. 70.5 days, P = 0.002) between the first admission and the reimplantation of a new prosthesis. The average cost of hospital stay ($8589.6 vs. $10,422.6, P = 0.021), antibiotics ($1052.2 vs. $1484.7, P = 0.032) and other medications ($691.5 vs. $1237.6, P = 0.014) per patient at our hospital were significantly decreased. Notably, significant improvements in patient satisfaction were seen in participants in the MR group. CONCLUSION Through MR by clinical pharmacists, medication discrepancies within the orthopedic ERAS program could be identified.

1671,35387691,"Community pharmacy professionals' practice in responding to minor symptoms experienced by pregnant women in Ethiopia: results from sequential mixed methods. BACKGROUND In countries with limited access to healthcare services, community pharmacists' management of minor symptoms experienced by pregnant women could be beneficial in terms of alleviating the burden of other health professionals and cost of services. However, evidence is limited regarding the practice of community pharmacy professionals in responding to minor pregnancy-related symptoms more generally, particularly in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate actual and self-reported practice of community pharmacists in the management of minor symptoms during pregnancy in Ethiopia. METHODS A sequential mixed method study using self-reported survey from 238 community pharmacists followed by 66 simulated client visits was conducted from March to July 2020 in six towns of the Amhara regional state in Ethiopia. Independent samples t-test and one-way Analysis of Variance was used to test the mean difference of practice score among subgroups of study participants. RESULTS The self-reported survey showed that most community pharmacist would 'always' gather most symptom-related information particularly about 'duration of symptoms,' 'frequency of symptoms,' and 'gestational age' and provide medication-related information on 'how to use the medication' and 'duration of use.' The highest mean practice scores were observed in relation to information gathering about 'gestational age' and information provision on 'how to use the medication.' In contrast, the lowest mean practice scores were observed in relation to information gathering about 'weight of the woman' and information provision on 'dosage form.' However, the actual practice, as revealed by the simulated client visits, demonstrated that most community pharmacists would rarely gather symptom-related information nor provide medication-related information. In addition, dispensing of non-prescribed medications to pregnant women was also common. The extent of self-reported practice differed among subgroups of study participants. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights extent of practice of community pharmacy professionals during the management of minor symptoms in pregnancy in Ethiopia. Discrepancies of results between self-reported and actual practices of community pharmacy professionals were observed. The inadequate actual practice of symptom-related information gathering and medication-related information provisions needs considerations of implementing interventions to minimize potential harms.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES To compare mental healthcare use and healthcare professional (HCP) contacts for patients before and after initiation of paliperidone palmitate. SETTING The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) Biomedical Research Centre Clinical Record Interactive Search. PARTICIPANTS We identified all adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision: F20.x), who had received paliperidone palmitate prescription for at least 365 days and had at least 1 year of recorded treatment from SLAM, prior to the first recorded receipt of paliperidone palmitate. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Inpatient and community mental healthcare service use, such as inpatient bed days, number of active days in the service, face-to-face and telephone HCP use in the 12 months before and after paliperidone palmitate initiation. RESULTS We identified 664 patients initiated on paliperidone palmitate. Following initiation, inpatient bed days were lower, although patients remained active on the service case load longer for both mirror approach 1 (mean difference of inpatient bed days -10.48 (95% CI -15.75 to -5.22); days active 40.67 (95% CI 33.39 to 47.95)) and mirror approach 2 (mean difference of inpatient bed days -23.96 (95% CI -30.01 to -17.92); mean difference of days active 40.69 (95% CI 33.39 to 47.94)). The postinitiation period was further characterised by fewer face-to-face and telephone contacts with medical and social work HCPs, and an increased contact with clinical psychologists. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate a change in the profile of HCP use, consistent with a transition from treatment to possible rehabilitation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1673,35387816,"What the public in England know about antibiotic use and resistance in 2020: a face-to-face questionnaire survey. OBJECTIVES To describe public attitudes and knowledge around antibiotic activity, resistance and use. DESIGN Face-to-face household 18 question survey using computer-assisted data collection undertaken by Ipsos Market and Opinion Research International. SETTING Randomly selected households across England, January-February 2020. PARTICIPANTS 2022 adults (aged 15+,) including 521 black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) participants, and 406 aged 15-25 years olds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Responses to questions about antibiotic activity, resistance and expectations for antibiotics and trust in healthcare professionals. Analyses were weighted to obtain estimates representative of the population with multivariable analysis undertaken for questions with five or more significant univariate variables. RESULTS 84% stated they would be pleased if their general practitioner (GP) said they did not need antibiotics. Trust in GPs to make antibiotic decisions remains high (89%) and has increased for nurses (76%) and pharmacists (71%). Only 21% would challenge an antibiotic decision; this was significantly greater in BAME participants (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.89 to 3.35). 70% reported receiving advice when prescribed antibiotics. Belief in benefits of antibiotics for ear infections was very high (68%). Similar to 2017, 81% agreed that antibiotics work for bacterial, 28% cold and influenza viruses. 84% agreed antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are increasing, only 50% agreed healthy people can carry ARB and 39% agreed there was nothing they personally could do about ARB. Social grade DE and BAME participants, and those with less education had significantly less understanding about antibiotics and resistance. CONCLUSIONS As trust in healthcare practitioners is high, we need to continue antibiotic education and other interventions at GP surgeries and community pharmacies but highlight that most ear infections are not benefitted by antibiotics. Targeted interventions are needed for socioeconomic DE, BAME groups and previous antibiotic users. We need to explore if increasing perceived personal responsibility for preventing ARB reduces antibiotic use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1674,35387829,"Development of an intervention to improve informational continuity of care in older patients with polypharmacy at the interface between general practice and hospital care: protocol for a participatory qualitative study in Germany. INTRODUCTION Older patients with multimorbidity, polypharmacy and related complex care needs represent a growing proportion of the population and a challenge for healthcare systems. Particularly in transitional care (hospital admission and hospital discharge), medical errors, inappropriate treatment, patient concerns and lack of confidence in healthcare are major problems that may arise from a lack of information continuity. The aim of this study is to develop an intervention to improve informational continuity of care at the interface between general practice and hospital care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A qualitative approach will be used to develop our participatory intervention. Overall, 32 semistructured interviews with relevant stakeholders will be conducted and analysed. The stakeholders will include healthcare professionals from the outpatient setting (general practitioners, healthcare assistants, ambulatory care nurses) and the inpatient setting (clinical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, clinical information scientists) as well as patients and informal caregivers. At a series of workshops based on the results of the stakeholder analyses, we aim to develop a participatory intervention that will then be implemented in a subsequent pilot study. The same stakeholder groups will be invited for participation in the workshops. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval for this study was waived by the Ethics Committee of Goethe University Frankfurt because of the nature of the proposed study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all study participants prior to participation. Results will be tested in a pilot study and disseminated at (inter)national conferences and via publication in peer-reviewed journals.

1675,35389359,"Effectiveness of a Pharmacist-Led Web-Based Medication Adherence Tool With Patient-Centered Communication: Results of a Clustered Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND Growing numbers of people use medication for chronic conditions; nonadherence is common, leading to poor disease control. A web-based tool to identify an increased risk for nonadherence with related potential individual barriers might facilitate tailored interventions and improve adherence. OBJECTIVE This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a newly developed tool aimed at improving medication adherence. METHODS We performed a cluster randomized controlled trial in patients initiating cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication. Participants were recruited from community pharmacies. They completed an online questionnaire comprising assessments of their risk for medication nonadherence and subsequently of barriers to adherence. In pharmacies belonging to the intervention group, individual barriers displayed in a graphical profile on a tablet were discussed by pharmacists and patients with high nonadherence risk in face-to-face meetings and shared with their general practitioners and practice nurses. Tailored interventions were initiated by pharmacists. Barriers of control patients were not presented nor discussed and these patients received usual care. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of the intervention on medication adherence at 8 months' follow-up between patients with an increased nonadherence risk from the intervention and control groups, calculated from dispensing data. RESULTS Data from 492 participants in 15 community pharmacies were available for analyses (intervention 253, 7 pharmacies; control 239, 8 pharmacies). The intervention had no effect on medication adherence (B=-0.01; 95% CI -0.59 to 0.57; P=.96), nor in the post hoc per-protocol analysis (B=0.19; 95% CI -0.50 to 0.89; P=.58). CONCLUSIONS This study showed no effectiveness of a risk stratification and tailored intervention addressing personal barriers for medication adherence. Various potential explanations for lack of effectiveness were identified. These explanations relate, for instance, to high medication adherence in the control group, study power, and fidelity. Process evaluation should elicit possible improvements and inform the redesign of intervention and implementation.

1676,35390112,"Impact of an infectious diseases pharmacist-led intervention on antimicrobial stewardship program guideline adherence at a Thai medical center. PURPOSE To evaluate and compare antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) guideline adherence (primary outcome) as well as length of stay, 30-day all-cause mortality, clinical cure, antimicrobial consumption, and incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens (secondary outcomes) between an infectious diseases (ID) pharmacist-led intervention group and a standard ASP group. METHODS A quasi-experimental study was performed at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2019 and April 2020. Data including baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record by the ID pharmacist. RESULTS The ASP guideline adherence in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group was significantly higher than in the standard ASP group (79% vs 56.6%; P < 0.001), especially with regard to appropriate indication (P < 0.001), dosage regimen (P = 0.005), and duration (P = 0.001). The acceptance rate of ID pharmacist recommendations was 81.8% (44/54). The most common key barriers to following recommendations were physician resistance (11/20; 55%) and high severity of disease in the patient (6/20; 30%). Compared to the standard ASP group, there was a trend toward clinical cure in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (63.6% vs 56.1%; P = 0.127), while 30-day all-cause mortality (15.9% vs 1.5%; P = 0.344) and median length of stay (20 vs 18 days; P = 0.085) were similar in the 2 groups. Carbapenem (P = 0.042) and fosfomycin (P = 0.014) consumption declined in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group. A marginally significant decrease in the overall incidence of MDR pathogens was also observed in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (coefficient, -5.93; P = 0.049). CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates that an ID pharmacist-led intervention can improve ASP guideline adherence and may reduce carbapenem consumption.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
1677,35390120,"Barriers and facilitators to implementing pharmacist-provided comprehensive medication management in primary care transformation. PURPOSE How to effectively integrate pharmacists into team-based models of care to maximize the benefit they bring to patients and care teams, especially during times of primary care transformation (PCT), remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators when integrating pharmacist-provided comprehensive medication management (CMM) services into a health system's team-based PCT using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). METHODS Semistructured qualitative interviews were carried out with 22 care team members regarding their perceptions of the implementation of CMM in the PCT. Transcripts were coded to identify CMM implementation barriers and facilitators, and resulting codes were mapped to corresponding CFIR domains and constructs. RESULTS Fifteen codes emerged that were labeled as either a barrier or a facilitator to implementing CMM in the PCT. Facilitators were the perception of CMM as an invaluable resource, precharting, tailored appointment lengths, insurance coverage, increased pharmacy presence, enhanced team-based care, location of CMM, and identification of CMM advocates. Barriers included limited clinic leadership involvement, a need for additional resources, CMM pharmacists not always feeling part of the core team, understanding of and training around CMM's role in the PCT, changing mindsets to utilize resources such as CMM more frequently, underutilization of CMM, and CMM scheduling. CONCLUSION Clinical pharmacists providing CMM represent a valuable interdisciplinary care team member who can help improve healthcare quality and access to primary care. Identifying and addressing implementation barriers and facilitators early during PCT rollout is critical to the success of team-based services such as CMM and becoming a learning health system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1678,35391834,"Drug-Related Hospital Admissions and Associated Factors among Adults Admitted to Felege Hiwot Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital, North West Ethiopia. Background A drug-related problem (DRP) is an event involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interferes with the desired therapeutic outcome. Drug-related hospital admission (DRHA) is hospitalization due to one or more DRPs. Objective This study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of DRHA and factors associated with it among adults admitted to the internal medicine wards of Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted using a previously validated tool, AT-HARM 10. Data were collected by two clinical pharmacists from July 1 to September 15, 2020. The data were entered into EpiData software (version 4.2.0.0) and then transported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS®) software (version 24) (IBM Corporation) for analysis. Descriptive statistics were presented using frequency and proportion. Binary logistic regression was applied to identify factors associated with DRHAs with a 95% confidence level, and significance was declared at a p value <0.05. Results The prevalence of DRHAs was 31.9% (95% CI = 27.7%-36.4%). From this, noncompliance (37.8%) (95% CI = 29.6-45.9), untreated indication (31.9%) (95% CI = 23.7-40), and adverse drug reaction (15.6%) (95% CI = 9.6-21.5) cause the majority of DRHAs. More than a quarter (28.8%) of all admissions were preventable. Most DRHAs were moderate (76.3) and preventable (80.7%). Lower to medium Charlson comorbidity index scores, longer duration of therapy, and not having health insurance were significantly associated with DRHAs. Conclusion The prevalence of DRHAs was considerably high. Noncompliance, untreated indications, and adverse drug reactions were the commonest DRPs that caused DRHAs. Lower to medium Charlson comorbidity index scores, longer duration of therapy, and not having health insurance were significantly contributing factors of DRHAs. Therefore, all healthcare providers should prevent, identify, and resolve DRPs to decrease DRHAs in the hospital.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Cannabis sativa, whose flowers are also known as marijuana or marihuana, is a recreational plant that contains many chemicals that are constantly being studied by scientists around the world. One of these substances is cannabidiol (CBD), which has gained widespread popularity on the internet as a cure for mental health problems, leading many people to use CBD to self-treat depression and anxiety. This article presents an exploratory cohort study (n = 90) of a group of people aged 16-69 using CBD to self-heal depression symptoms. The survey included basic sociodemographic questionnaire and validated Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale. And was distributed via the Internet. The results were statistically analyzed. High school degree was the most commonly held education (46%), large city was the most popular place of living (33%) and majority of the respondents have a full-time job (53%). Only 19% of the respondents consult their doctor or pharmacists about taking CBD. On the group of psychiatric patients, only 49% of respondents tell their psychiatrist about using the compound. Psychiatrists should be aware of CBD use in their patients during their daily practice, as CBD use can be found within people from all walks of life, and due to public interest, there is a need for education and research on the efficacy and safety of CBD use for mental disorders.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1680,35392558,"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Hospital Pharmacists in Central China Towards Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study.  Background: Healthcare professionals' knowledge and attitudes towards adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and ADR reporting play a significant role in pharmacovigilance. This study aims to investigate the gap between knowledge and practice in ADR reporting among hospital pharmacists. Methods: This study is a multi-center, cross-sectional study based on a questionnaire survey. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed including knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards ADR reporting. From October to November 2021, questionnaires were filled out on the internet by hospital pharmacists from a central province of China. The data analysis used a one-way ANOVA to analyze the differences between the pharmacist's characteristics and knowledge and attitude, respectively. The ordinal logistic regression method was used to analyze the predictors of practice. Results: A total of 1,026 valid questionnaires from 512 medical institutions were collected. It was found that 88.8% of participants have a clear understanding of the ADR definition, while 59.6% of them have misunderstandings about the reporting time of new and serious adverse reactions. Most pharmacists showed positive attitudes towards ADR reporting. Higher education background, higher professional title, attending training, and clinical pharmacist resulted in higher knowledge scores. Higher education background, shorter working years, attending training, and from non-tertiary hospital related to higher attitude scores. In terms of practice, age, hospital type, working years, training, and pharmacist type all have significant associations with practice scores. Pharmacists' knowledge score and attitude score were significant predictors of practice score with OR being 1.19 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.33) and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.07). Conclusion: Although most hospital pharmacists showed positive attitudes towards ADR reporting, their knowledge and practice were still insufficient. Hospital pharmacists' knowledge and attitude are associated with their practice towards ADR reporting. The training had a significant impact on the pharmacist's knowledge, attitude, and practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1681,35392695,"A Retrospective Cohort Evaluation of a Pharmacist-Led Approach for Transitioning Patients to an Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor. BACKGROUND Heart failure guidelines recommend replacing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) to reduce morbidity and mortality in NYHA Class II-III patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). OBJECTIVE This study aims to determine if a pharmacist-led outpatient ARNI replacement and titration program led to more patients achieving target doses of ARNI compared to usual care. METHODS A single health system, retrospective electronic medical record review identified 791 patients with active ARNI prescriptions and at least two outpatient cardiology visits with a pharmacist or usual care provider between January 2015 through September 2018. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved a target ARNI dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. The secondary outcomes were the median dose achieved, number of visits required to achieve target dose, hospitalizations, and all-cause death. RESULTS ARNI was initiated and continued by a pharmacist in 64 patients and 727 by usual care. More patients in the pharmacist group, 60.9% (n = 39), achieved target dose vs. 18.0% (n = 131) of patients managed by usual care (95% CI, 0.31-0.55, p < 0.0001). The pharmacist group also had higher median total daily dose of ARNI (200 mg (IQR = 300) vs 100 mg (IQR = 100), p < 0.0001) and more likely to achieve a higher total daily dose in fewer visits. CONCLUSIONS An advanced practice provider pharmacist-led outpatient ARNI replacement and titration program was more effective in achieving target doses of ARNI in HFrEF patients as compared to usual care.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Ambulatory,
1682,35392901,"Provider perspectives on emergency department initiation of medication assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder. BACKGROUND Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is ubiquitous and its sequelae contribute to high levels of healthcare utilization, yet AUD remains undertreated. The ED encounter represents a missed opportunity to initiate medication assisted treatment (MAT) for patients with AUD. The aims of this study are to identify barriers and facilitators to the treatment of AUD in the ED, and to design interventions to address identified barriers. METHODS Using an implementation science approach based on the Behavior Change Wheel framework, we conducted qualitative interviews with staff to interrogate their perspectives on ED initiation of AUD treatment. Subjects included physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, clinical social workers, and pharmacists. Interviews were thematically coded using both inductive and deductive approaches and constant comparative analysis. Themes were further categorized as relating to providers' capabilities, opportunities, or motivations. Barriers were then mapped to corresponding intervention functions. RESULTS Facilitators at our institution included time allotted for continuing education, the availability of clinical social workers, and favorable opinions of MAT based on previous experiences implementing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Capability barriers included limited familiarity with naltrexone and difficulty determining which patients are candidates for therapy. Opportunity barriers included the limited supply of naltrexone and a lack of clarity as to who should introduce naltrexone and assess readiness for change. Motivation barriers included a sense of futility in treating patients with AUD and stigmas associated with alcohol use. Evidence-based interventions included multi-modal provider education, a standardized treatment algorithm and order set, selection of clinical champions, and clarification of roles among providers on the team. CONCLUSIONS A large evidence-practice gap exists for the treatment of AUD with Naltrexone, and the ED visit is a missed opportunity for intervention. ED providers are optimistic about implementing AUD treatment in the ED but described many barriers, especially related to knowledge, clarification of roles, and stigma associated with AUD. Applying a formal implementation science approach guided by the Behavior Change Wheel allowed us to transform qualitative interview data into evidence-based interventions for the implementation of an ED-based program for the treatment of AUD.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Computer-based education is gaining popularity in healthcare professional development education due to ease of distribution and flexibility. However, there are concerns regarding user engagement. This pilot study aims to: 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a social reward and the corresponding study design; and 2) to provide preliminary data on the impact of social reward on user engagement. METHODS A mixed method study combing a four-month pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), surveys and interviews. The RCT was conducted using a computer-based education platform. Participants in the intervention group had access to a social reward feature, where they earned one meal for donation when completing a quiz with a passing score. Participants in the control group did not have access to this feature. Feasibility and acceptability of the social reward were assessed using surveys and telephone interviews. Feasibility of the RCT was assessed by participant recruitment and retention. User engagement was assessed by number of quizzes and modules completed. RESULTS A total of 30 pharmacy professionals were recruited with 15 users in each arm. Participants reported high acceptability of the intervention. The total number of quizzes completed by the intervention group was significantly higher compared to the control group (n = 267 quizzes Vs. n = 97 quizzes; p-value 0.023).

1684,35392907,"Evaluation of the reliability of the criteria for assessing prescription quality in Chinese hospitals among pharmacists in China. BACKGROUND The reliability of Criteria for Assessing Prescription Quality in Chinese Hospitals (CAPQCH) has never been rigorously verified. This study was designed to verify the reliability of the CAPQCH among pharmacists in China. METHODS Fourteen pharmacists, 5 from hospitals and 9 from the communities were recruited. We randomly selected 200 prescriptions, and made the testing prescriptions including appropriate and inappropriate testing prescriptions. Pharmacists assessed these testing prescriptions according to criteria in CAPQCH. Three test sets (Set 1, Set 2, and Set 3) were evaluated at 6-month intervals. Before administration of Set 3, pharmacists were informed that achievement on Set 3 would be reflected in their performance appraisal. We also evaluated the performance based on prescription comments before and after combining several confusing criteria. Cohen's Kappa statistic, Fleiss' Kappa statistic, and accuracy were employed to evaluate reliability among pharmacists. RESULTS Median values of Cohen's Kappa were 0.61 in Set 1, 0.66 in Set 2, and 0.80 in Set 3; reliability is thus substantial. Our data indicate no significant differences between Set 1 and Set 2, whereas Set 3 indicates significantly improved performance. Moreover, combinations of confusing criteria contributed little to improvement of performance in prescription comments. CONCLUSION Our results verified the reliability of CAPQCH application by working pharmacists. Adding performance based on prescription comments to personal appraisals was effective in improving the quality of prescription comments. These findings may be useful when future modification of the CAPQCH is considered.

BACKGROUND Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for breast cancer reduces mortality, but one-third to one-half of patients discontinue it early or are nonadherent. OBJECTIVE We developed a pilot single-site study of patients with evidence of early nonadherence to AET to assess the feasibility of a novel, clinical pharmacist-led intervention targeting symptom and medication management. METHODS Patients with prescription fill records showing nonadherence were enrolled in a single-arm feasibility study. Automated reminders were sent by e-mail or text with a link to symptom monitoring assessments weekly for 1 month and monthly until 6 months. Clinical oncology pharmacists used guideline-based symptom management and other medication management tools to support adherence and ameliorate symptoms reported on the assessments. Patient-reported outcome assessments included physical, mental, and social health domains and self-efficacy to manage symptoms and medications. Feasibility outcomes included completion of symptom reports and pharmacist recommendations. RESULTS Of 19 participants who were nonadherent who enrolled and completed initial assessments, 18 completed all final study procedures, with 14 completing all assessments and no patient missing more than 3 assessments. All 18 participants reported at least one of 3 symptom types, and the majority reported attempting pharmacist recommendations. Patient-reported measures of physical, mental, and social health and self-efficacy improved, and 44% of the patients became adherent.

Discharge summaries are important medical documents that summarise a patient's hospital admission. The Royal College of Physicians provides standardised guidance on the content of discharge summaries, given their important role as a handover document to general practitioners (GPs). Our project started in June 2020 on an acute medical ward, where significant variation had been noted in the quality and content of discharge summaries. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) was formed including doctors, nurses and hospital/community pharmacists, as well as a patient representative, to ensure active patient co-design. The problem was scoped by asking GPs to provide feedback via surveys and process mapping. Our aim was to increase the compliance of discharge summaries with 10 core criteria from a baseline of 55% to 95% by June 2021. Change ideas were developed by the MDT and were tested using plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles that included additional pharmacy support, a discharge summary template and individualised feedback. The project reached its goal of 95% compliance in January 2021, 5 months ahead of the target date, and this improvement has been sustained since. The project expanded to a second acute medical unit ward in May 2021. The expanded project reached its goal of 90% compliance within 6 weeks and maintained sustained improvement with further PDSA cycles.

1687,35395002,"To what extent do people living with HIV, people on pre-exposure prophylaxis, doctors and pharmacists endorse 90-day dispensing of antiretroviral therapy in France? JUSTIFICATION The WHO 95-95-95 targets for 2030 do not imply that people living with HIV (PLHIV) achieve a good quality of life. The current 30-day dispensing interval for antiretroviral (ART) burdens the healthcare system. Lengthening dispensing intervals could alleviate this burden as well as enhance patient well-being. OBJECTIVES To capture perceptions on 90-day dispensing interval (90D) for ART from the perspective of PLHIV, people on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), doctors, and pharmacists. METHODS Multi-centre observational survey led in France from 16 to 20 October 2020, among doctors agreeing to participate via regional coordinated care organisations for HIV, all PLHIV or people on PrEP consulting these outpatient-clinic doctors, and pharmacists doing ART dispensing. RESULTS The survey was completed by 220 doctors who saw 1087 people (999 PLHIV; 88 on PrEP) and 176 pharmacists from 55 centres. Among the PLHIV, 855 (85.6%, 95% CI: 83.2%-87.7%) and among the patients on PrEP, 70 (79.5%, 95% CI: 69.6%-87.4%) stated they would be interested in 90D. All in all, patients who were more likely to endorse 90D are those who opt exclusively for hospital dispensing (OR 3.22 [1.57-6.58]) and who rotate between hospital and community pharmacy dispensing (OR 3.29 [1.15-9.32]). Patients who were less likely to endorse 90-D were those who consult in a city located outside the 3 French high HIV prevalence regions (OR 0.66 [0.44-0.99]), receive 2 vs 1 pill QD regimens (OR 0.53 [0.31-0.91]), and anticipate at least one vs no limitation to 90D (OR 0.27 [0.17-0.42]). 90D was perceived as possible by 152 pharmacists (86.4%), including 8 (5%) without restriction, and 219 doctors (99.6%), including 42 (19.2%) regardless of PLHIV's immunovirologic status or social conditions (health insurance coverage, access to housing or accommodation, access to rights, resources). Comparison of the benefits and limitations of a 90-day ART dispensing interval as perceived by PLHIV and people on PrEP, doctors and pharmacists shows that doctors anticipate a higher number of benefits than people on ART and/or pharmacists, chiefly that 90D would be more convenient and create less risk of drug shortages and that patients would gain autonomy and a better quality of life. Pharmacists were found to clearly perceive the economic benefits (90D would be less expensive) but anticipate more drawbacks than doctors and the people on ART themselves: more administrative burdens, more non-dispensing if doses get lost, harder to track adherence and more drug-drug interaction issues, and more work as they shall have to warn the patient of potential risks of shortages due to the cost of the stock. CONCLUSION A clear majority of PLHIV, people on PrEP, doctors, and pharmacists endorsed 90D of ART. Most patients thought that 90D would be a good option, whereas most pharmacists and doctors thought that eligibility for 90D dispensing should depend on immunovirologic factors and social condition criteria. Moreover, pharmacists thought it would be necessary to commit regulatory resources and a better follow-up on adherence and drug-drug interactions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM To evaluate the impact of the PROMPT-QoL on identifying drug-related problems (DRPs), physicians' acceptance of pharmacist's recommendations on the DRP resolution, and clinical and quality of life outcomes. METHOD A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary public hospital in Thailand from October 2019 to May 2020. A total of 286 outpatients with chronic diseases were randomly allocated into the control group (provided with pharmaceutical care only) (N = 146) and the intervention group (provided with pharmaceutical care together with use of the PROMPT-QoL) (N = 140). RESULTS A significantly higher mean number of DRPs could be identified in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a significantly higher proportion of physicians' acceptance of pharmacist's recommendations on the DRP resolution in the intervention than in the control group (p = 0.019). Regarding the clinical outcome, a significantly higher proportion of the DRP resolution was found in the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.002).

1690,35396214,"Frequency of Course Remediation and the Effect on NAPLEX Pass Rates.  Objective. Remediation is a tool which allows students to correct an academic deficiency after earning an unsatisfactory grade. There is a lack of data on remediation processes and its impact on future academic performance. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of remediation frequency on NAPLEX performance.Methods. The primary analysis was the relationship between the NAPLEX first-time pass rate and the frequency of course remediations (no remediations, one remediation, and two or more remediations). Additional analyses included the correlation between the NAPLEX scaled score and the number of course remediations and characteristics of the course remediated.Results. A total of 116 students with NAPLEX data were included for analysis. Compared to students who never remediated, NAPLEX first-time pass rates were similar among those who remediated only one course; however, students who remediated two or more courses had significantly lower NAPLEX pass rates. Remediation in courses mapped to PCOA Area 4 (Clinical Sciences) and courses with mixed PCOA content areas were negatively correlated with NAPLEX scaled scores. A significant negative correlation existed between P2 and P3 year remediations and NAPLEX scaled score but was not significant for the P1 year.Conclusion. Multiple course remediations are negatively correlated with NAPLEX scaled scores and a reduced first-time NAPLEX pass rate with a single course remediation having no effect. Institutions should aim to evaluate their current remediation practices and assess whether additional support should be provided to students with multiple course remediations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1691,35396281,"From basic to advanced computerised intravenous to oral switch for paracetamol and antibiotics: an interrupted time series analysis. OBJECTIVES Early switch from intravenous to oral therapy of bioequivalent drugs has major advantages but remains challenging. At our hospital, a basic clinical rule was designed to automatically alert the physician to review potential intravenous to oral switch (IVOS). A rather low acceptance rate was observed. In this study, we aimed to develop, validate and investigate the effect of more advanced clinical rules for IVOS, as part of a centralised pharmacist-led medication review service. DESIGN AND SETTING A quasi-experimental study was performed in a large teaching hospital in Belgium using an interrupted time series design. INTERVENTION A definite set of 13 criteria for IVOS, focusing on the ability of oral absorption and type of infection, was obtained by literature search and validated by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Based on these criteria, we developed a clinical rule for paracetamol and one for ten bioequivalent antibiotics to identify patients with potentially inappropriate intravenous prescriptions (PIVs). Postintervention, the clinical rule alerts were reviewed by pharmacists, who provided recommendations to switch in case of eligibility. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES A regression model was used to assess the impact of the intervention on the number of persistent PIVs between the preintervention and the postintervention period. The total number of recommendations, acceptance rate and financial impact were recorded for the 8-month postintervention period. RESULTS At baseline, a median number of 11 (range: 7-16) persistent PIVs per day was observed. After the intervention, the number reduced to 3 (range: 1-7) per day. The advanced IVOS clinical rules showed an immediate relative reduction of 79% (incidence rate ratio=0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.32; p<0.01) in the proportion of persistent PIVs. No significant underlying time trends were observed during the study. Postintervention, 1091 recommendations were provided, of which 74.1% were accepted, resulting in a total 1-day cost saving of €4648.35. CONCLUSIONS We showed the efficacy of advanced clinical rules combined with a pharmacist-led medication review for IVOS of bioequivalent drugs.",1,1,0,0,1,Reviewer 2 was unsure that pharmacist intervention was the difference between pre and post periods in the study.

1692,35397487,"Retrospective analysis of patterns of opioid overdose and interventions delivered at a tertiary hospital emergency department: impact of COVID-19. BACKGROUND Opioid-related overdoses cause substantial numbers of preventable deaths. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist available in take-home naloxone (THN) kits as a lifesaving measure for opioid overdose. As the emergency department (ED) is a primary point of contact for patients with high-risk opioid use, evidence-based recommendations from the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia THN practice guidelines include the provision of THN, accompanied by psychosocial interventions. However, implementation of these guidelines in practice is unknown. This study investigated ED opioid-related overdose presentations, concordance of post-overdose interventions with the THN practice guidelines, and the impact, if any, of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on case presentations. METHODS A single-centre retrospective audit was conducted at a major tertiary hospital of patients presenting with overdoses involving opioids and non-opioids between March to August 2019 and March to August 2020. Patient presentations and interventions delivered by the paramedics, ED and upon discharge from the ED were collated from medical records and analysed using descriptive statistics, chi square and independent T-tests. RESULTS The majority (66.2%) of patients presented to hospital with mixed drug overdoses involving opioids and non-opioids. Pharmaceutical opioids were implicated in a greater proportion (72.1%) of overdoses than illicit opioids. Fewer patients presented in March to August 2020 as compared with 2019 (26 vs. 42), and mixed drug overdoses were more frequent in 2020 than 2019 (80.8% vs. 57.1%). Referral to outpatient psychology (22.0%) and drug and alcohol services (20.3%) were amongst the most common post-discharge interventions. Naloxone was provided to 28 patients (41.2%) by the paramedics and/or ED. No patients received THN upon discharge. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights opportunities to improve ED provision of THN and other interventions post-opioid overdose. Large-scale multi-centre studies are required to ascertain the capacity of EDs to provide THN and the impact of COVID-19 on opioid overdose presentations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1693,35397527,"Determine the impact of a structured pharmacist-led medication review - a controlled intervention study to optimise medication safety for residents in long-term care facilities. BACKGROUND Medication reviews contribute to protecting long-term care (LTC) residents from drug related problems (DRPs). However, few controlled studies have examined the impact on patient-relevant outcomes so far. OBJECTIVE We examined the impact of a one-time, pharmacist-led medication review on medication changes (primary endpoint) including discontinued medication, the number of chronic medications, hospital admissions, falls, and deaths (secondary endpoints). METHODS A prospective, controlled intervention study was performed in three LTC facilities. In the intervention group (IG), after performing a medication review, a pharmacist gave recommendations for resolving DRPs to physicians, nurses and community pharmacists. The control group (CG) received usual care without a medication review. (i) We assessed the number of medication changes and the secondary endpoints in both groups before (t0) and after (t1, t2) the intervention. (ii) Additionally, the medication review was evaluated in the IG with regard to identified DRPs, the healthcare professional's feedback on the forwarded pharmacist recommendations and whether DRPs were finally resolved. RESULTS 107 (IG) and 104 (CG) residents were enrolled. (i) More medication changes were identified in the IG than in the CG at t1 (p = 0.001). However, no significant difference was identified at t2 (p = 0.680). Mainly, medication was discontinued in those medication changes. Chronic medications increased in the CG (p = 0.005) at t2 while hospital admissions, falls, and deaths showed no differences. (ii) Overall, 1252 DRPs (median: 10; minimum-maximum: 2-39) were identified. Recommendations for 82% of relevant DRPs were forwarded to healthcare professionals, of which 61% were accepted or clarified. 22% were not accepted, 12% required further review and 6% remained without feedback. 51% of forwarded DRPs were finally resolved. CONCLUSIONS We found more medication changes in the IG compared to controls. Mostly, medication was discontinued. This suggests that our intervention was successful in discontinuing unnecessary medication. Other clinical outcomes such as falls, hospitalisations, and deaths were not improved due to the one-time intervention. The medication review further identified a high prevalence of DRPs in the IG, half of which were finally resolved.

1694,35397543,"Assessing the pharmaceutical care provision to suspected COVID-19 patients in community pharmacies: a simulated patient study. BACKGROUND In the wake of COVID-19, community pharmacists (CP) were called upon to free up healthcare providers to treat more serious conditions and alleviate overcrowded healthcare centers. CPs were placed under tremendous pressure, where many patients primarily sought their health advice. This situation raised concerns about the preparedness of CPs in facing these challenges. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the appropriateness of pharmaceutical care provided by CPs to patients with suspected COVID-19 and to investigate their communication skills. METHODS A simulated patient (SP) study was conducted among randomly selected community pharmacies in Beirut, Lebanon. Each pharmacy was visited by the SP who complained of fever and loss of smell sensation. Interactions between the attending pharmacist and the suspected COVID-19 patient were documented directly after each visit in a standardized data collection form. RESULTS More than half of the CPs (56%) did not retrieve any relevant information to assess the patient's condition. While pharmacists' responses were limited to one to two recommendations, with the majority recommending the patient to perform the PCR test (90%). Inappropriate recommendations made by the CPs included mainly the confirmation that the patient had COVID-19 without prior testing (9%), and prescribing either an antimicrobial drug (5%) or dietary supplements (20%), claiming that the latter are essential to boost the patient's immunity. As for the pharmacist-patient communication skills, the mean total score was 2.25 ± 0.79 (out of 4), displaying nonoptimal and ineffective communication. CONCLUSION An unsatisfactory and suboptimal provision of pharmaceutical care to a suspected COVID-19 case was evident. This may be a public health threat, particularly for developing countries that lack an efficient and unified healthcare system. The findings should alert health authorities to support and guide community pharmacists in assisting suspected COVID-19 patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1695,35397932,"Evidence- and consensus-based guidelines for drug-drug interactions with anticancer drugs; A practical and universal tool for management.  Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with anticancer drugs are common and can significantly affect efficacy and toxicity of treatment. Therefore, a Dutch Multidisciplinary Expert group is assessing the clinical significance of DDIs in oncology and provides recommendations for the management of these DDIs. We present an overview of methodology and outcome of an evidence- and consensus-based assessment of DDIs between anticancer drugs and non-anticancer drugs. A literature search was performed through PubMed and EMA and FDA assessment reports, to identify potential DDI's involving anticancer drugs. For each potential DDI a concept report for risk analysis and practical advice for management was created. Subsequently, this risk analysis and the corresponding advice were assessed and weighed. A total of 290 potential DDIs have been identified in the literature thus far. Of these 290 potential DDIs, the Expert Group has identified 94 (32%) DDIs as clinically relevant, with a need for an automated alert and a suggested intervention. Furthermore, 110 DDIs have been identified as clinically not relevant. For 86 potential DDIs evidence supporting a relevant DDI was insufficient and in these cases neither an alert nor advice regarding a suggested intervention were formulated. A transparent risk analysis is presented for identification of clinically relevant DDIs with anticancer drugs. Integration of DDI guidelines into the national electronic prescribing system is essential to achieve optimal efficacy and minimal toxicity in patients receiving anticancer therapy. A clear overview of clinically relevant DDIs with anticancer therapy provides clinicians with a structured, evidence-based and consensus-built tool for anticancer therapy surveillance.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1696,35398004,"Establishment and evolution of a clinical pharmacy mental health hospital-in-the-home service: An autoethnography. BACKGROUND Hospital-in-the-Home (HiTH) services provide ""inpatient-style"" care for patients at home. While relatively well known in non-psychiatric settings, little is known about mental health (MH)-HiTH services, with even less known about the role of a clinical pharmacist (CP) within a MH-HiTH multidisciplinary team (MDT). OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to describe the evolution of the first MH-HiTH MDT in Western Australia and the various facets of the CP's role integrated within the service. METHOD The integration of a CP into a non-traditional practice setting represents a cultural change in the pharmacy profession. Hence, this paper utilised a descriptive-realistic style of the autoethnographic method, with the narrative written in the first-person point of view of the first author (M.F.). It specifically focused on the tasks performed by the team's CP. A narrative analysis approach was used to reflect on the reason these tasks are performed, the potential benefits and limitations of integrating a CP into the team and subsequent cultural influence on the pharmacy profession. FINDINGS The service commenced in 2014, consisting of an MDT of a consultant psychiatrist, a psychiatric registrar, clinical nurses, an occupational therapist, a social worker and a CP. Starting with 4 then 8 ""virtual beds"", it was gradually increased to 16 virtual beds. The MH-HiTH CP combined hospital clinical tasks - e.g. medication reconciliation and therapeutic drug monitoring - with home medication reviews as part of the MH-HiTH MDT. Lessons learnt include proactively integrating and flexibly adapting into a novel practice setting. CONCLUSION There is scope to embed a CP within an MH-HiTH MDT; the major advantage is the inclusion of a comprehensive medication management service. While this is a promising new area where the pharmacy profession is becoming engaged, more studies are needed to quantify and confirm the stated benefits of such service.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1697,35398722,"Caring for women with epilepsy in Palestine: A qualitative study of the current status. OBJECTIVE This qualitative study was conducted to explore the current status of caring for women with epilepsy (WWE) in the Palestinian healthcare system. METHODS This study used an explorative qualitative design. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit the participants. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with neurologists (n = 6), gynecologists (n = 5), psychiatrists (n = 3), an internist (n = 1), and clinical pharmacists (n = 5). The interpretive description methodology was used to thematically analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS A total of 745 min (12.4 h) of interview time were analyzed. The qualitative data collected in this study were categorized under 3 major themes and multiple subthemes. The 3 major themes were: (1) diagnosis and care for patients with epilepsy, (2) general issues in caring for patients with epilepsy, and (3) consideration of women's issues in the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy. Formally adopted protocols/criteria for the diagnosis and care for WWE were lacking. CONCLUSION Findings of this qualitative study showed a need to formally adopt uniform guidelines that can guide the diagnosis and care of WWE in the Palestinian healthcare system. The findings of this study might be informative to healthcare providers, decision-makers in healthcare authorities, WWE, and patient advocacy groups who could be interested in improving and benchmarking healthcare services provided to WWE.

1698,35400614,"The impact of a provider motivational interviewing-based training on chronic pain management in a federally-qualified health center. BACKGROUND While the issue of opioid misuse is very complex, pharmacists have a unique opportunity to participate in interprofessional, team-based care. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been shown to be effective in chronic disease management and could improve patient engagement and chronic pain outcomes. OBJECTIVES To determine the impact of an MI-based provider training on changes in chronic pain management prescribing and on provider and patient perceptions. METHODS Providers participated in a pharmacist-led, 4-session educational intervention covering the CDC opioid prescribing guidelines, pain management, clinical pearls, and MI. Providers were then asked to implement the training in patient appointments for chronic pain management and refer appropriate patients for follow-up on goals. In the follow-up, student pharmacists called patients twice monthly for three months using MI. To address the primary outcome, the number of opioid prescriptions, morphine daily equivalents, and naloxone prescriptions were recorded and compared from the electronic medical record for the year preceding and following the intervention. Patients and providers completed surveys to assess the impact of these interventions. RESULTS Providers (n = 11) reported increased confidence in MI from baseline to 12 months following the intervention but no change in satisfaction. Patients (n = 19) were able to set and accomplish 20 goals throughout the phone call intervention. Meanwhile, the number of opioid prescriptions significantly decreased from 569 to 368 prescriptions per year before and after the intervention, respectively. Morphine daily equivalents per prescription decreased from 26.8 to 26.4 for the year before versus the year following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS MI interventions for providers and patients may positively impact goal setting and opioid prescribing. However, MI alone may not successfully address provider satisfaction and patient physical functioning. Pain management is an area that may benefit from a multi-faceted, interprofessional approach.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1699,35400748,"A novel study on clinical pharmacist and psychiatrist collaborative pharmacotherapy management services among elderly population with psychiatric illness. Background Geriatric psychiatry has yet to receive its due recognition in India. There is increasing evidence of a rise in morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, and loss of functional status related to common mental disorders in the elderly patients. Collaborative care approach, including a clinical pharmacist, is one of the possible approaches to cope with geriatric patients with psychiatric patients. Objective The study aimed to assess the impact of pharmacotherapy management of geriatric patients in collaboration with pharmacist and psychiatrist. Materials and Methods A prospective interventional study was conducted in the psychiatry outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Mysore over 6 months. Geriatric patients who were newly diagnosed with depression, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and alcohol dependency syndrome (ADS) were included in this study. The clinical pharmacist scrutinized the patients for their participation in the study. Included patients were followed up on monthly basis for up to 4 months. Pharmacotherapy management was provided to the enrolled patients. Interventions provided were discussed with the psychiatrist. Descriptive analysis was performed for categorical variables. Results A total of 84 geriatric patients were enrolled in the study. Majority of the enrolled patients were female (n = 46, 54.7%). Nearly half of the patients were illiterate (n = 40, 47.6%) and unemployed (n = 38, 45.2%). Among the enrolled patients, half of the study participants were diagnosed with depression (63.09%) followed by BPAD (27.38%), Schizophrenia (7.14%), and ADS (2.38%). A total of 155 medication information services were provided to 84 patients including patient counseling (n = 84, 100%), pharmacist interventions (n = 48, 30.96%) and medication information (n = 23, 14.83%). Most of the interventions were adverse drug reactions followed by drug-drug interactions, failure to receive drugs, untreated indication, subtherapeutic dose, drug use without indication, and overdose. Majority of the interventions (n = 46, 95.8%) provided were accepted by the psychiatrist.

Background: Community health centers (CHCs) are a backbone healthcare facility for tuberculosis (TB) services. Identifying barriers amongst TB service providers at the CHC level is required to help them deliver successful TB treatment. Aims: The current study aimed to analyze barriers to successful TB treatment from the perspective of TB service providers at the CHC level in a high prevalent TB country. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in a province of Indonesia with a high TB prevalence. Two districts representing rural and urban areas were selected to obtain information from TB service providers (i.e., physicians and nurses) at the CHC level. In addition, key informant interviews with TB patients, hospital TB specialists, pharmacists, and activists were conducted. The trustworthiness and credibility of the information were established using information saturation, participant validation, and triangulation approaches. The interviews were also transcribed for the inductive analysis using Atlas.ti 8.4 software. Results: We identified 210 meaning units from 48 participants and classified them into two main themes: organizational capacity and TB program activities. We identified the inadequacy of human resources, facility, and external coordination as the main barriers to organizational capacity. Furthermore, the barriers were identified regarding TB program activities, that is, inadequate TB case finding, diagnosis, drug supply chain and dispensing management, treatment and monitoring, case recording and reporting, and public-private collaboration.

1701,35401235,"Integrating Pharmacy and Registry Data Strengthens Clinical Assessments of Patient Adherence.  Background: Accurate clinical assessment of patient adherence using reliable and valid measures is essential in establishing the presence of adherence issues and support practices for pharmacists. Objective: This investigation aims to conduct a novel assessment of patient adherence to asthma controller therapy by combining 1) patient-specific dosage data found in pharmacy dispensing data with 2) centrally collected administrative claims records, to determine the added value of using both sources of data. Methods: A total of 381 clinically uncontrolled asthma patients, from 95 community pharmacies across three Australian States were recruited and provided consent for the retrieval of their claims records and pharmacy dispensing data. Patients were stratified as multiple or single pharmacy users and adherence scores were calculated via the proportion of days covered (PDC) method using 1) patient claims records, 2) patient pharmacy dispensing data, and 3) combined claims records and pharmacy dispensing data. Cohort and subgroup adherence estimates were then compared. Results: Low levels of adherence were evident amongst the cohort irrespective of the data source used. PDC estimates based on claims records alone or combined claims records and pharmacy dispensing data were significantly higher than estimates based on pharmacy dispensing data for the total cohort (56%, 52%, 42% respectively, p < 0.001) and more noticeably for multiple pharmacy users (67%, 64%, 35% respectively, p < 0.001). PDC estimates based on combined claims records and pharmacy dispensing data were significantly lower than estimates based on claims records alone, indicating that perhaps standard daily dose is not a robust proxy for prescribed dosage to inhaled respiratory devices in adherence approximations. Poorer adherence was found amongst single pharmacy users than multiple pharmacy users when combined claims records and pharmacy dispensing data (46% compared to 64% respectively, p < 0.001) or claims records alone (51% compared to 67% respectively, p < 0.001) were compared. Conclusion: Access to routine collected data increases clinical acuity over patient adherence to asthma controller medications and is a valuable resource for health care professionals. A policy of secure accessibility of such data at the patient-pharmacist or patient-GP interface may allow real-time intervention and assist in decision making across numerous therapeutic areas.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1702,35401242,"Acceptance Factors for In-Hospital Pharmacist Interventions in Daily Practice: A Retrospective Study.  Introduction: Performing pharmacist interventions (PIs) during the medication review helps to improve the quality of care. The acceptance by the physician of these PIs is a good indicator of the quality of this clinical pharmacy activity. The objective of this study was to determine, in the Amiens-Picardie teaching hospital (France), factors of acceptance in a variable environment of activity (central pharmacy, in the care units, computer assisted). Methods: All PIs transcribed by pharmacists on the Act-IP© site between November 2018 and April 2019 were analyzed using a complementary search in patient records. The environment, type, and clinical impact on patient health of each PI was collected. Linear mixed-effects models with a random pharmacist intercept were used to investigate the relationship between PI modalities and their chance of being accepted. Results: A total of 3,100 PIs were traced, of which 2,930 had been followed over time. Of these, 2,930 PIs, 1,504 (51.3%) were performed by a postgraduate pharmacist and 1,426 (48.7%) by a pharmacy resident, 1,623 (55.4%) were performed by verbal exchange, 455 (15.5%) by telephone, 846 (28.9%) by computer software, and 6 (0.2%) by paper. The clinical impact on patient health was major for 976 PIs (33.3%) and vital for 26 PIs (0.9%). According to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC), they were mainly related to anti-infectives (30.3%), the nervous system (18.7%), and blood and blood-forming organs (17.3%). In total, 2,415 PIs (82.4%) were accepted. According to the multivariate model, a PI was more often accepted when it was transmitted orally rather than by software (+27.7%, 95% CI: +23.2 to +32.1%) and when it was transmitted to a medical resident rather than a postgraduate physician (+4.4%, 95% CI: 1.2-7.6%). In these cases, there was a major rather than a moderate clinical impact on patient health (+4.3%, 95% CI: +1.1-+7.6%). Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of the quality of the exchange with the prescriber and the prioritization of high-risk interventions as key points of medication review to improve rate of pharmacist interventions accepted by physician.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic diversity based on sequence types of MRSA strains was illustrated in previous studies; meanwhile, the diversity along with the predominant sequence type, especially in Egypt, remains unknown. The purpose of the current study was to determine the diversity of the predominant MRSA clone ST239-MRSA (n = 50) isolated from different hosts and clinical samples and to illustrate the correlation between the resistance patterns, toxin genes, and the genetic background in Port-said and El-Sharkia Governorates, Egypt. The ST239-MRSA clone was analyzed by phenotypic antibiotyping and various genotypic assays comprising SCCmec, agr, spa, coa, and coa-RFLP in addition to toxin gene profiles. Most of the analyzed strains (40/50, 80%) were multidrug resistant (MDR), belonged to SCCmec-III, agr-I, and coa genotype I, and harbored sea and pvl genes. A negative correlation between the toxin gene profiles and antimicrobial resistance was recorded. Meanwhile, the correlation between the toxin gene profiles and the genetic background was not observed in this study. Although ST239-MRSA strains belonged to a single sequence type, they exhibited a high degree of phenotypic and genotypic diversity, indicating weak clonality and adaptability.

Purpose The use of carbapenem before and after implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship-led carbapenem-sparing strategy at a tertiary care center in Lebanon was evaluated. Methods A retrospective, observational chart review was performed on all hospitalized pediatric and adult patients who received carbapenem therapy during January 2019 and January 2020. Patients who started their regimen before January or received carbapenems for less than 24 hours were excluded. Primary outcomes included the appropriateness of physician prescribing patterns and pharmacists' interventions, as well as appropriateness and response rates of the latter. Secondary outcomes included the carbapenem defined daily dose (DDD) and days of therapy (DOT). Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis and a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results A total of 157 and 150 patients charts were reviewed in January 2019 and January 2020, respectively. There was no difference in baseline characteristics except for inpatient services and rates of isolated multidrug-resistant organisms. When comparing the two timelines, the appropriateness of physicians' prescribing patterns increased in terms of empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and duration of therapy but the results were not statistically significant. Pharmacists' interventions significantly increased with regards to the duration of therapy (p= <0.001), dose adjustment (p<0.001), de-escalation to a narrower spectrum antibiotic (p=0.007), and use of extended infusion (p=0.042). The DDD and DOT were higher for ertapenem and lower for anti-pseudomonal carbapenems in January 2020. Conclusion The carbapenem-sparing strategy adopted by the antimicrobial stewardship program contributed to an increase in the number of interventions made by pharmacists on carbapenem therapy, including their appropriateness, and response rate. Despite an improvement in the physician-prescribing patterns, more awareness and education may be needed to achieve a better impact.",0,0,1,1,0,Unclear if stewardship was conducted by pharmacists.,,,,,,,,,
1705,35402654,"Parkinson's Disease Medication Prescribing and Administration During Unplanned Hospital Admissions. Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with a lifetime risk of 1% to 3%. Treatment includes supplementation of central dopaminergic neurotransmission with levodopa preparations and dopamine agonists. Misprescribing and delayed administration of these medications on admission to hospital can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Objective We aimed to assess the accuracy of time-critical PD medication prescribing and administration during unplanned hospital admissions. Methods Patients admitted during a 15-month period with PD on time-critical PD medications were included. Their electronic patient records were compared with the pharmacist medication reconciliation to assess accuracy of admission prescribing. Accuracy of administration was assessed by comparing the time medications were administered to the time they were due. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software was used to perform statistical analysis in this study. Results A total of 102 admissions of 70 patients (67% men) were included for analysis. These patients were on 1.6 ± 0.8 time-critical PD medications before admission, accounting for 4.1 ± 1.8 administrations per day. Time-critical medications were prescribed correctly on admission in 50% of admissions, with errors in medication timing most common (31.6%). Of all doses, 51.7% were administered >30 minutes late, and 29.7% of doses were administered >1 hour late.

1706,35403383,"Molecular pathogenesis of acetaminophen-induced liver injury and its treatment options.  Acetaminophen, also known as N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), is commonly used as an antipyretic and analgesic agent. APAP overdose can induce hepatic toxicity, known as acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI). However, therapeutic doses of APAP can also induce AILI in patients with excessive alcohol intake or who are fasting. Hence, there is a need to understand the potential pathological mechanisms underlying AILI. In this review, we summarize three main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AILI: hepatocyte necrosis, sterile inflammation, and hepatocyte regeneration. The relevant factors are elucidated and discussed. For instance, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) protein adducts trigger mitochondrial oxidative/nitrosative stress during hepatocyte necrosis, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released to elicit sterile inflammation, and certain growth factors contribute to liver regeneration. Finally, we describe the current potential treatment options for AILI patients and promising novel strategies available to researchers and pharmacists. This review provides a clearer understanding of AILI-related mechanisms to guide drug screening and selection for the clinical treatment of AILI patients in the future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1708,35403665,"Evaluation of pharmacist time dedicated to vancomycin dosing in adult patients using a 24-hour AUC nomogram or trough monitoring approach: A time motion study. PURPOSE Evidence-based guideline recommendations for vancomycin dosing recently shifted from a trough-based strategy to an area under the curve (AUC) approach. While several AUC dosing methods exist, the optimal approach has not been determined. Literature characterizing time requirements for various vancomycin dosing strategies remains limited. METHODS A time and motion study was conducted to measure the time spent by clinical pharmacists dosing vancomycin using an AUC nomogram. Pharmacists who dosed and monitored vancomycin for adult patients on the general medical ward (GMW) or intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center consented to study participation. Vulnerable patients and vancomycin orders for surgical infection prophylaxis were excluded. The primary outcome was the median amount of time clinical pharmacists dedicated to vancomycin-related clinical activities during an 8-hour weekday shift. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients prescribed vancomycin at the beginning of each shift and factors contributing to greater than average time spent on vancomycin-related responsibilities. RESULTS Seven clinical pharmacists collected data on 178 vancomycin orders. The estimated amount of time a clinical pharmacist spent on daily vancomycin responsibilities averaged 10.45 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 6.94-15.8 minutes). The overall median time requirement per vancomycin assessment was 3.45 minutes (IQR, 1.95-6.7 minutes). The only factor independently associated with prolonged dosing time was follow-up dosing from a previous day. CONCLUSION The study elucidated time requirements associated with an AUC nomogram-based vancomycin dosing approach. This data could be used to compare time requirements associated with other existing vancomycin dosing strategies, which may help healthcare systems determine the optimal AUC dosing method for their specific practice model.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1709,35404138,"Pharmacological profile and potential drug interactions in ovarian cancer hospitalized patients.  The aim of this study was to identify the main therapeutic classes prescribed to ovarian cancer patients and the potential drug interactions (PDI) during hospitalization. This descriptive retrospective work was carried out in a referral gynecological cancer hospital from the Brazilian public health system. The first 24 h inpatients' prescriptions were evaluated to obtain the pharmacological profile data. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected through the analysis of electronic medical records. A total of 236 patients were included in the study, of which 154 (65.25%) had PDI, with a mean of 1.43 ± 1.76 interactions per patient. The main therapeutic classes prescribed were analgesics and antiemetics (35%), compatible with the oncologic supportive care. All PDI identified (n = 331) were categorized by severity, using the Micromedex database, resulting in: 1.51% contraindicated, 67.67% major, 24.77% moderate, and 6.04% minor. The more prevalent PDI were ondansetron/tramadol (22.05%) and metoclopramide/tramadol (7.25%), both major. An association between PDI and polypharmacy was observed, which did not occur between age or length of stay. Ongoing prescription review by the pharmaceutical team is necessary to identify, monitor, and manage PDI-related adverse events and carry out required interventions with patients, physicians, and nurses. Taken together the data showed that even in a specialized hospital, the complexity of the pharmacotherapy can cause harm to the ovarian cancer patient. The clinical pharmacist acting in a multidisciplinary team is important for improving patient safety in oncology services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES To estimate the association of 340B contract pharmacy growth between 2009 and 2019 with county-level characteristics, including availability of health care providers, health care spending, population, and socioeconomic characteristics. STUDY DESIGN Observational study. METHODS We constructed county-level maps of 340B contract pharmacy penetration for the years 2009 and 2019 by 340B participant type (hospital or safety-net clinic). We then used a multivariable linear probability regression model to estimate the association of county-level characteristics in 2009 with the probability of gaining at least one 340B contract pharmacy within the county by 2019. We estimated separate regressions for safety-net clinics and hospitals. RESULTS We find that growth of contracts with 340B hospitals was uncorrelated with uninsured rates, poverty rates, or areas of medical underservice. By contrast, we find that growth of contracts with 340B safety-net clinics was positively correlated with poverty rates and metropolitan statistical status. These findings suggest different patterns of access for patients. CONCLUSIONS Our results add systematic evidence of a difference in how the 2 main types of 340B participants-hospitals and safety-net clinics-use the 340B program. Policy proposals to reform 340B should consider reforms for safety-net clinics and hospitals separately.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1711,35405078,"Factors associated with naloxone availability and dispensing through Michigan's pharmacy standing order. BACKGROUND Pharmacy standing order policies allow pharmacists to dispense naloxone, thereby increasing access to naloxone. OBJECTIVES To describe pharmacy standing order participation and associations of pharmacy and community characteristics that predict naloxone availability and dispensing across eight counties in Michigan. METHODS We conducted a telephone survey of 662 standing order pharmacies with a response rate of 81% (n = 539). Pharmacies were linked with census tract-level demographics, overdose fatality rates, and dispensing data. County maps were created to visualize pharmacy locations relative to fatality rates. Regression models analyzed associations between pharmacy type, neighborhood characteristics, fatality rates, and these outcomes: naloxone availability, having ever dispensed naloxone, and counts of naloxone dispensed. RESULTS The prevalence of standing order pharmacies was 54% (n = 662/1231). Maps revealed areas with higher fatality rates had fewer pharmacies participating in the standing order or lacked any pharmacy access. Among standing order pharmacies surveyed, 85% (n = 458/539) had naloxone available and 82% had ever dispensed (n = 333/406). The mean out-of-pocket cost of Narcan® was $127.77 (SD: 23.93). National chains were more likely than regional chains to stock naloxone (AOR = 3.75, 95%CI = 1.77, 7.93) and to have ever dispensed naloxone (AOR 3.02, 95%CI = 1.21,7.57). Higher volume of naloxone dispensed was associated in neighborhoods with greater proportions of public health insurance (IRR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.21, 1.58) and populations under 44 years old (IRR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.04, 1.48). There was no association with neighborhood overdose fatality rates or race in regression models. CONCLUSION As deaths from the opioid epidemic continue to escalate, efforts to expand naloxone access through greater standing order pharmacy participation are warranted.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1712,35407628,"An Up-to-Date Article Regarding Particularities of Drug Treatment in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure.  Since the prevalence of heart failure (HF) increases with age, HF is now one of the most common reasons for the hospitalization of elderly people. Although the treatment strategies and overall outcomes of HF patients have improved over time, hospitalization and mortality rates remain elevated, especially in developed countries where populations are aging. Therefore, this paper is intended to be a valuable multidisciplinary source of information for both doctors (cardiologists and general physicians) and pharmacists in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of heart failure patients. We address several aspects regarding pharmacological treatment (including new approaches in HF treatment strategies [sacubitril/valsartan combination and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors]), as well as the particularities of patients (age-induced changes and sex differences) and treatment (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in drugs; cardiorenal syndrome). The article also highlights several drugs and food supplements that may worsen the prognosis of HF patients and discusses some potential drug-drug interactions, their consequences and recommendations for health care providers, as well as the risks of adverse drug reactions and treatment discontinuation, as an interdisciplinary approach to treatment is essential for HF patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1713,35409584,"Development and Evaluation of Interactive Flipped e-Learning (iFEEL) for Pharmacy Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND Distance learning has come to the forefront of educational delivery throughout the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Presently, there is a paucity of studies that have utilized interactive e-lectures as a model for remote flipped learning. OBJECTIVES To compare educational outcomes for the remote interactive flipped e-learning (iFEEL) activity versus paper-based in-class group learning (PICkLE). METHODS During the spring 2021 semester, tutorials in pharmaceutical quality control and good manufacturing practice were remotely delivered to students by two different approaches: PICkLE and iFEEL. In the latter activity, interactive e-lectures were software-designed and included several audiovisual enhanced illustrations to encourage students to interact with the lecture material prior to attending the virtual class. The class time was reserved for in-class quizzes and discussion. Mean exam scores were compared and voluntary questionnaires were distributed among the participating students as well as healthcare faculty members in 29 Saudi universities. Data from the remotely-delivered course was compared with data from previous course offerings (2018-2020) that used the live PICkLE method. RESULTS The mean score of post-lecture tests significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased compared to pre-lecture tests in remote PICkLE and iFEEL, respectively. iFEEL activity showed higher mean post-tests score (95.2%) compared to live PICkLE (90.2%, p = 0.08) and remote PICkLE (93.5%, p = 0.658). Mean comprehensive exam scores increased from 83.8% for remote PICkLE to 89.2% for iFEEL (p = 0.449). On average, 92% of students and 85% of faculty members reported positive feedback on the five quality attributes of the e-lecture. Over 75% of students preferred the iFEEL over PICkLE activity for future course offerings and 84% of faculty members recommend the integration of interactive e-lectures in their future courses. CONCLUSION iFEEL represents a novel model of remote flipped learning and shows promising potential to be incorporated into live blended-learning classroom activities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1714,35409914,"Reducing Medication Problems among Minority Individuals with Low Socioeconomic Status through Pharmacist Home Visits. INTRODUCTION In this study, pharmacists conducted home visits for individuals of medically underserved populations in Taiwan (i.e., socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, middle-aged or older adults, and individuals living alone, with dementia, or with disabilities) to understand their medication habits. We quantified medication problems among various groups and investigated whether the pharmacist home visits helped to reduce the medication problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS From April 2016 to March 2019, pharmacists visited the homes of the aforementioned medically underserved individuals in Taipei to evaluate their drug-related problems and medication problems. Age, living alone, diagnoses of dementia or disabilities, and socioeconomic disadvantages contributed significantly to inadequate disease and medical treatment knowledge and self-care skills as well as lifestyle inappropriateness among patients. The patients who were living alone and socioeconomically disadvantaged stored their drugs in inappropriate environments. RESULTS After the pharmacists visited the patients' homes twice, the patients improved considerably in their disease and medical treatment knowledge, self-care skills, and lifestyles (p &lt; 0.001). Problems related to the uninstructed reduction or discontinuation of drug use (p &lt; 0.05) and use of expired drugs (p &lt; 0.001) were also mitigated substantially. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Through the home visits, the pharmacists came to fully understand the medicine (including Chinese medicine) and health food usage behaviors of the patients and their lifestyles, enabling them to provide thorough health education. After the pharmacists' home visits, the patients' drug-related problems were mitigated, and their knowledge of diseases, drug compliance, and drug storage methods and environments improved, reducing drug waste.

BACKGROUND Educational games make the learning process more enjoyable, fun, and create a competitive classroom environment that can positively affect learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pharmacy students' perceptions of crossword puzzles (CWPs) as a learning tool in the pharmacotherapy cardiovascular module focusing on anticoagulants' therapeutics and assessing if students' preference of learning style influenced their perception. METHODS Clues for the puzzle were developed, validated, and piloted by course faculty. A free internet puzzle generator was used to create puzzles with 10 to 20 clues. Students were given 30 min to solve the puzzle following six hours of didactic lectures about the topic. An 8-item survey instrument and Pharmacists' Inventory of Learning Styles (PILS) questionnaire were administered to examine students' perceptions of the game and their learning style preference, respectively. RESULTS Two hundred sixty-seven students participated in the activity from both undergraduate programs (BPharm and PharmD) over three consecutive course offerings. Most students expressed favorable perceptions of the puzzle. Female and BPharm students had significantly more favorable perceptions than male and PharmD students on several perception items. The dominant preferred learning style (PLS) was converger (35.6%), followed by assimilator (25.3%), while 15.1% had mixed learning styles. The study did not find a significant association between PLS and students' perceptions toward the CWP.

1716,35410312,"TASC (Telehealth After Stroke Care): a study protocol for a randomized controlled feasibility trial of telehealth-enabled multidisciplinary stroke care in an underserved urban setting. BACKGROUND Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for recurrent stroke, and blood pressure (BP) reduction is associated with decreased risk of stroke recurrence. However, hypertension remains poorly controlled in many stroke survivors. Black and Hispanic patients have a higher prevalence of uncontrolled BP and higher rates of stroke. Limited access to care contributes to challenges in post-stroke care. Telehealth After Stroke Care (TASC) is a telehealth intervention that integrates remote BP monitoring (RBPM) including nursing telephone support, tailored BP infographics and telehealth video visits with a multidisciplinary team approach including pharmacy to improve post-stroke care and reduce stroke disparities. METHODS In this pilot trial, 50 acute stroke patients with hypertension will be screened for inclusion prior to hospital discharge and randomized to usual care or TASC. Usual care patients will be seen by a primary care nurse practitioner at 1-2 weeks and a stroke neurologist at 1 and 3 months. In addition to these usual care visits, TASC intervention patients will see a pharmacist at 4 and 8 weeks and will be enrolled in RBPM consisting of home BP monitoring with interval calls by a centralized team of telehealth nurses. As part of RBPM, TASC patients will be provided with a home BP monitoring device and electronic tablet that wirelessly transmits home BP data to the electronic health record. They will also receive tailored BP infographics that help explain their BP readings. The primary outcome will be feasibility including recruitment, adherence to at least one video visit and retention rates. The clinical outcome for consideration in a subsequent trial will be within-patient change in BP from baseline to 3 months after discharge. Secondary outcomes will be medication adherence self-efficacy and satisfaction with post-stroke telehealth, both measured at 3 months. Additional patient reported outcomes will include depression, cognitive function, and socioeconomic determinants. Multidisciplinary team competency and fidelity measures will also be assessed. CONCLUSIONS Integrated team-based interventions may improve BP control and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in post-stroke care. TASC is a post-acute stroke care model that is novel in providing RBPM with tailored infographics, and a multidisciplinary team approach including pharmacy. Our pilot will determine if such an approach is feasible and effective in enhancing post-stroke BP control and promoting self-efficacy.

1718,35410875,"A pharmacovigilance study on antiepileptic medications in a paediatric hospital in Italy. OBJECTIVE The standard treatment for epilepsy is based on the appropriate use of antiseizure medications (ASMs) to prevent the recurrence of seizures. For the newer ASMs, however, little information on their safety profile is available. This work sought to fill this gap by creating a database for ASM use in a paediatric hospital and the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported. METHODS This observational single-centre study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020 and recorded the type of ASM treatment for paediatric epileptic patients cared for at the Neuropsychiatry Unit of the Salesi Paediatric Hospital in Ancona, Italy, as well as any ADRs. RESULTS In all, 519 patients were admitted to the ward with a diagnosis of epilepsy, 362 (69.7%) of whom were prescribed ASMs. Valproic acid was the most frequently prescribed drug (29.96%), followed by levetiracetam (13.97%) and carbamazepine (9.16%). We recorded 24 ADRs in 20 patients, half of which (n=12) occurred with polytherapy. Among the ADRs associated with monotherapy, 25% (n=6) were induced by carbamazepine; 12.5% (n=3) were associated with either valproic acid, clonazepam or lamotrigine; 8.3% (n=2) were associated with perampanel, clobazam or levetiracetam; while one patient experienced ADR due to vigabatrin, one due to ethosuximide and one due to cannabidiol. The median patient age was 7.5 years and most ADRs were not serious. CONCLUSION During the 3-year observation period, 6% of epileptic patients on ASMs showed one or more ADRs. Carbamazepine was responsible for about a quarter of these reactions, two of which were serious. Half of the ADRs occurred with polytherapy, which often included valproic acid and stiripentol. It is to be hoped that such active pharmacovigilance through the collaboration of hospital pharmacists and physicians will serve to improve the management of treatment.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1721,35411270,"Donning and Doffing of Personal Protective Equipment: Perceived Effectiveness of Virtual Simulation Training to Decrease COVID-19 Transmission and Contraction.  Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic exposed gaps in the knowledge of correct donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare workers, causing hospitals to ramp up training. However, social distancing measures forced most institutions and workplaces to shift to remote operations, allowing only essential personnel onsite. Virtual simulation is a growing trend in healthcare simulation education, even more so in this pandemic era. Yet, we have found no evidence of the perceived effectiveness of virtual simulation for training healthcare providers in the proper donning and doffing of PPE. This study aims to determine learner perceptions of the effectiveness of a virtual simulation PPE training module. Methods To address this gap, we used a virtual simulation training module in an online format to determine the perceived efficacy of this method of instruction with the contribution of a variety of healthcare providers and trainees, including physicians, surgeons, pharmacists, dentists, and nurses. Results We found a statistically significant difference in the confidence level of observing best practices of donning and doffing PPE before and after the training sessions. We also found that participants believe virtual simulation can be an effective educational tool for clinical skills.

INTRODUCTION The American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP) and American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Residency Directories are two of the more traditional resources available to pharmacy students and residents looking for post-graduate programs. More recently, social media platforms have grown as an innovative means of resident recruitment and program marketing. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of social media by both PGY1 and PGY2 candidates in their pursuit of post-graduate training through the disbursement of a survey. METHODS A survey consisting of 14 questions ranging from multiple-choice questions to free-text options was emailed out to the Office of Experiential Education from 141 ACCP-accredited pharmacy schools and 1341 ASHP-accredited PGY1 Pharmacy Residency Program Directors, requesting them to forward the email to their students or residents. RESULTS There were a total of 714 respondents to the survey. A majority of surveyors were in the process of completing a PGY1 residency training program (70.6%). The most common platform used to research pharmacy residency programs was the ASHP directory (97.3%). A majority of respondents did not use social media to research residency programs (66.7%). Out of the ones who did use social media, Instagram was the most common platform used and provided the greatest insight into the residency program. About 60% of respondents preferred Zoom as the virtual meeting platform during interviews.

1726,35413836,"The influence of non-clinical pharmacists' understanding of and attitudes towards pharmaceutical care on their willingness to serve as clinical pharmacists in China. BACKGROUND The shortage of clinical pharmacists is severe in China, and transferring non-clinical pharmacists into clinical pharmacists serves as a feasible solution to this problem. In China, a one-year training programme is available for non-clinical pharmacists, and those who have finished the programme are certificated as clinical pharmacists. However, not all non-clinical pharmacists are willing to serve as clinical pharmacists, and their willingness to serve as clinical pharmacists may be related to their attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. This study aims to test whether non-clinical pharmacists' attitudes towards pharmaceutical care is positively correlated with their willingness to serve as clinical pharmacists. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in secondary and tertiary hospitals in China to collect non-clinical pharmacists' basic demographic information, attitudes towards pharmaceutical care and willingness to serve as clinical pharmacists. An ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to test the relationship between non-clinical pharmacists' attitudes towards pharmaceutical care and their willingness to serve as clinical pharmacists. RESULTS One thousand five hundred eighty non-clinical pharmacists from 755 hospitals were invited to participate in the study. Finally, 1308 valid responses were obtained and the response rate reached 82.78%. The regression results (R2 = 0.052, chi-square = 174.024, p < 0.0001) suggested that attitudes towards pharmaceutical care had a positive impact on non-clinical pharmacists' willingness to serve as clinical pharmacists (p < 0.01).

INTRODUCTION There is a paramount need for moral development for pharmacists and pharmacy students to practice the patient-centered profession. We aimed to explore the current situational judgment utilizing ethical reasoning among undergraduate pharmacy students. METHODS A set of ten ethical dilemmas, representing potential real-life situations that the students come across in the university and may face in the future as a pharmacist were developed by a team of students, academic staff, and stakeholders. These ethical dilemmas were validated, checked for accuracy, and piloted. An online questionnaire was created consisting of these ten scenarios as open-ended questions and administered to fourth year and fifth year PharmD students in a public university located at the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, asking them how they would react in that situation. Responses of the participants were analyzed using thematic analysis independently by four researchers and inter-rater agreement were achieved through consensus. RESULTS Out of 205, 186 students completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 90.7%. Analysis and resulted in the generation of 32 codes, which were then categorized into seven overarching themes: student engagement, social and professional responsibility, academic integrity, legal obligation, moral obligation, signposting, and moral engagement and patient safety. CONCLUSIONS Undergraduate pharmacy students experience complex state of mind in connection with ethical reasoning. The participants' situational judgment were driven by cultural norm, authority, and responsibility.

1728,35414327,"Community Pharmacy Credentialing for Medical Insurance to Facilitate Sustainability in COVID-19 Testing. BACKGROUND In April 2020, pharmacists were added as medical providers under Idaho Medicaid in response to recent scope expansion for pharmacists and to increase beneficiaries' access to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing and services. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted expedited Medicaid enrollment for pharmacists but did not address coverage of medical services provided to privately insured individuals for pharmacy-based testing services. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe processes used by independently owned, community-based pharmacies in Idaho to credential with private insurers and report outcomes. METHODS Relevant information and forms required to credential with the four major payers in the state of Idaho were collected. Packets were obtained via medical insurers' websites and by direct contact. Questions that arose from community pharmacists during the submission process were collected and answered on a shared spreadsheet, and insurance representatives were contacted directly to resolve questions. RESULTS Eight out of 13 participating pharmacies submitted an average of three credentialing packets for their facilities. Thirty-five pharmacists also submitted an average of four credentialing packets for themselves. As of mid-May 2021, nearly 20 weeks after submission, only 67 out of 129 pharmacists had received word regarding the status of their applications. Less than half of all pharmacist applications were approved (after their first attempt). CONCLUSION Efforts to support the education of both pharmacists and medical insurers may streamline the credentialing processes in the future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1729,35414485,"""Never waste a good crisis"": Opportunities and constraints from the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmacists' scope of practice. BACKGROUND In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many pharmacy-based or pharmacist-delivered services were introduced or amended to mitigate the pandemic's health and social impact. This happened within the context of pharmacists seeking more opportunities to increase their clinical responsibilities and play a larger role in primary care. OBJECTIVE(S) To analyse the policymaking context and pharmacy responses to COVID-19 that enable or constrain the expansion of pharmacists' scope of practice. METHODS This study is a policy analysis of documentary data detailing changes in pharmacy policy in Australia, drawing on a ""policy space analysis"" framework to identify opportunities and constraints to policy reform. Data were collected from news for health professionals; federal/jurisdictional legislation and media releases; and guidelines and directives from government health departments and agencies. Changes to pharmacy practice were identified and classified according to type. For each change, potential opportunities and constraints for expanding pharmacists' scope of practice were identified. RESULTS Four categories of changes were identified: medicines limits/restrictions; alternatives to paper prescriptions; public health measures; and community pharmacist-delivered services. Opportunities from the pandemic response that could expand scope of practice include the potential permanence of temporary measures that increase pharmacists' responsibilities; remuneration to legitimise services; political acknowledgement of medicines safety and access as a priority; and government need to quickly address crises. Constraints include the potential permanence of temporary measures that restrict pharmacists' practice; negative perceptions of pharmacists from other clinicians; intra-professional disagreements regarding pharmacy-based services; and lack of pharmacist representation in institutional structures. CONCLUSIONS This analysis demonstrates that the pandemic responses and policy context may facilitate expansion of pharmacists' scope of practice, and identifies possible avenues to do so; it also highlights constraints that need to be further addressed to achieve this goal.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of medication therapy management interventions on drug therapy problems (DTPs), medication adherence and treatment satisfaction among ambulatory heart failure (HF) patients. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A one-group pre-post quasi-experimental study was conducted on 423 ambulatory HF patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital (TASH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. All ambulatory HF patients ≥18 years old attending the adult cardiac clinic of TASH and having a complete medical record and fully met the inclusion criteria were taken as study participants. INTERVENTIONS Educational interventions along with a brochure with information on the nature of HF disease and its treatment were provided to study participants. DTPs encountered were resolved by a team of pharmacists and physicians. RESULTS In the preintervention phase, 288 DTPs were identified with a mean (SD) of 1.3±1.1. A significant reduction of DTPs (0.67±1.1, p<0.001) was observed in the postintervention phase compared with the preintervention phase. At the postintervention phase, 36.4%, 61.9% and 1.7% of HF patients were highly, medium and low adherent to their treatment regimens, respectively. The total composite score for treatment satisfaction of the study participants was 80.35%. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study demonstrated that by teaming up clinical pharmacists with cardiologists and cardiology fellows, it was possible to reduce the occurrence of DTPs, improve medication adherence and increase treatment satisfaction of HF patients attending at the outpatient cardiac clinic.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1731,35414562,"Contribution of supervision to the development of advanced practitioners: a qualitative study of pharmacy learners' and supervisors' views. OBJECTIVE To apply educational theory to explore how supervision can contribute to the development of advanced practitioners using the example of several postregistration primary care training pathways for pharmacy professionals (pharmacists and pharmacy technicians). DESIGN Qualitative semistructured telephone interviews applying Billet's theory of workplace pedagogy for interpretation. SETTING England. PARTICIPANTS Fifty-one learners and ten supervisors. PRIMARY OUTCOME Contribution of clinical and educational supervision to the development of advanced practitioners in primary care. RESULTS Findings were mapped against the components of Billet's theory to provide insights into the role of supervision in developing advanced practitioners. Key elements for effective supervision included supporting learners to identify their learning needs (educational supervision), guiding learners in everyday work activities (clinical supervision), and combination of regular prearranged face-to-face meetings and ad hoc contact when needed (clinical supervision), along with ongoing support as learners progressed through a learning pathway (educational supervision). Clinical supervisors supported learners in developing proficiency and confidence in translating and applying the knowledge and skills they were gaining into practice. Learners benefited from having clinical supervisors in the workplace with good understanding and experience of working in the setting, as well as receiving clinical supervision from different types of healthcare professionals. Educational supervisors supported learners to identify their learning needs and the requirements of the learning pathway, and then as an ongoing available source of support as they progressed through a pathway. Educational supervisors also filled in some of the gaps where there was a lack of local clinical supervision and in settings like community pharmacy where pharmacist learners did not have access to any clinical supervision. CONCLUSIONS This study drew out important elements which contributed to effective supervision of pharmacy advanced practitioners. Findings can inform the education and training of advanced practitioners from different professions to support healthcare workforce development in different healthcare settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1732,35414586,"Development and Delphi validation of a Best Possible Medication History form. OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a standardized Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) form that could be used by clinical pharmacists. METHODS The draft version was presented to a focus group and was adapted following their comments. A three-rounds e-Delphi method was used to validate content, usability and face validity of the BPMH form. We supplemented the quantitative analysis with a qualitative analysis of comments for each Delphi round. RESULTS The draft BPMH form contained 23 items grouped into eight tabs. Refinement of these tabs and items by the focus group resulted in 7 tabs and 21 items, which were included in the Delphi survey. The consensus was obtained for all tabs within the second round (p=0.072). Consensus was reached on 76% (16/21) of items in the third round. 20 items were included following the qualitative analysis of the experts' comments in the third round. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study provide data on the content of the BPMH form. This form can be used to help clinical pharmacists to collect a complete and accurate medication list on admission. It could have an impact on inpatient safety and improve inpatient management.

1733,35416833,"Factors associated with the identification of drug therapy problems among older patients in Primary Health Care. OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of drug therapy problems among older adults in Primary Health Care, and to analyze the factors associated with their identification in the initial patient assessment, carried out by pharmacists offering medication therapy management services. METHODS A cross-sectional study conducted with data from 758 older adults followed up in medication therapy management services in Primary Health Care in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Betim, and Lagoa Santa (MG, Brazil). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the factors associated with identification of four or more drug therapy problems in the initial clinical assessment. RESULTS A total of 1,683 drug therapy problems were identified, 73.6% of older patients had at least one problem. The most frequent problems were nonadherence (23.0%) and the need for additional drug therapy (18.0%). Polypharmacy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and aged 75 years or older remained positively and statistically associated with identification of four or more drug therapy problems (p<0.05). CONCLUSION There is a high frequency of problems related to medication use among older users of Primary Health Care, and the medication therapy management services should be prioritized to the older patients, who present with polypharmacy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and age ≥ 75 years, since they are more likely to have more drug therapy problems.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to systematically review and compare the quantitative effect of clinical interventions designed to improve adherence to urate-lowering therapy. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for interventional studies reporting quantitative adherence to urate-lowering therapy information as an endpoint. Intervention details, quantitative adherence information, clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness data were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed. From 4721 records, 11 studies (3 randomised and 8 observational) met the inclusion criteria. Pharmacist- and nurse-led interventions were described, involving a mixture of patient education, telephone or mobile texting reminders, and medication blister packing. Quantitative adherence information was obtained using methods such as patient self-reporting and pharmacy-dispensing data. Most studies had a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Two of the three randomised studies reported improvement in adherence between the intervention and control groups, including a 13% increase in the mean proportion of days covered >0.8 [341/681 participants (50%) versus 289/782 participants (37%)] and an 88% increase in achieving a high Medicine Taking Behaviour questionnaire score [37/42 participants (88.1%) versus 0/40 participants (0%)]. Four of the eight observational studies reported improved adherence from baseline (ranging from 33% to 91% based on the longitudinal change in adherence metrics reported). A comparison of the different types of interventions was not feasible due to the heterogeneity between study designs and adherence metrics used. These findings support the need for more interventional studies to be conducted to aid adherence management.",0,0,1,1,1,Pharmacist interventions were included,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Other,,,,Other,

BACKGROUND Tech-check-tech (TCT) programs in pharmacies are beneficial in facilitating a transition from fee for service dispensing tasks to advanced patient care, but they are underutilized. OBJECTIVE To describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a transferable TCT program in several North Dakota pharmacies, with the goal of facilitating future efforts in other states. METHODS We developed a universal TCT implementation toolkit, recruited 6 pharmacies to implement it, developed an educational program for the pharmacies, and worked with the pharmacies over a year to assess success of the program. Pre- and post-implementation surveys assessed pharmacist and technician responses in regards to program effectiveness. Four outcomes were measured, and included pharmacist's time savings, descriptive comments on changes in workflow, incidence of errors and near misses, and barriers to implementation. RESULTS The implementation of TCT was unanimously perceived as successful and increasing efficiency in the post-site surveys completed by pharmacists. All 13 technicians who participated in the post-survey indicated the methods and materials used for training were sufficient and appropriate. The most commonly cited barrier to implementation of TCT stated by technicians was incorporating TCT into their current workflow. No dispensing errors which resulted in patient impact occurred throughout the duration of this study. CONCLUSIONS A TCT implementation template provided a successful framework for TCT in various pharmacy settings and can serve as a model for other pharmacy settings, states, or regions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1736,35417771,"Addressing opioid medication misuse at point of service in community pharmacy: A study protocol for an interdisciplinary behavioral health trial. BACKGROUND >1 in 3 of the 9 million individuals engaged in opioid medication misuse obtain legitimate opioid prescriptions and fill these in community pharmacies, which are subsequently misused. This study is testing the efficacy of a pharmacist-led intervention-Brief Intervention-Medication Therapy Management (BI-MTM)-compared to standard medication counseling (SMC) to address opioid medication misuse. METHODS Design. This study is a single-blinded 2-group parallel randomized trial within 13 community pharmacies that will enroll 350 individuals. Participant Recruitment. Pharmacy staff approach patients and ask about interest in completing a brief confidential screening tool, which includes opioid medication misuse assessment. Interested patients who report misuse are asked to provide informed consent. Enrolled patients are assessed for behavioral and physical health at enrollment, 2-months post-enrollment, and 6-months post-enrollment. INTERVENTIONS Following baseline assessment, participants are randomized (1:1 ratio) to: SMC, a medication information/counseling intervention or BI-MTM, an intervention comprised by 4 evidence-based components: medication therapy management, brief intervention, naloxone dispensing, and patient navigation. ANALYSES Primary analyses involve estimating 3-level generalized linear mixed models to relate repeated assessments across time of opioid medication misuse (i.e., the Prescription Opioid Misuse Index) to the intervention. CONCLUSION Study results will provide the first critical step towards integrating a highly accessible, low-cost approach to managing risks related to opioid use. Community pharmacies provide an incredibly important setting in which patients can receive high quality care to support health behavior change. Successfully completing this project sets the stage for a large-scale effectiveness study. (NCT#: NCT05141266).",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1737,35417791,"Pain Severity and Interference and Substance Use among Community Pharmacy Patients Prescribed Opioids: A Secondary Analysis of the PHARMSCREEN Study.  This secondary analysis examined relationships between pain severity and interference and substance use among patients filling opioid prescriptions in Indiana and Ohio community pharmacies (n = 1,461). We likewise sought to explore the moderating role of gender in pain-substance use relations. We used patient-reported data from a cross-sectional health survey linked with controlled substance dispensing data from statewide prescription drug monitoring programs. Multivariable logistic regression estimated associations between pain severity and interference and various indices of risky prescription opioid use and non-opioid substance use. Exploratory analyses examined whether gender moderated associations. Increased pain severity was associated with increased odds of moderate- to high-risk opioid use (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.16-1.31) and opioid-benzodiazepine co-use (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03-1.40). Increased pain interference was associated with greater odds of receiving opioids from multiple pharmacies or providers (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01-1.31). Increased pain severity and interference were associated with higher odds of any tobacco use (severity: OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.21; interference: OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12) and weekly to daily sedative use (severity: OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.25; interference: OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.22). Increased pain severity was associated with decreased odds of any alcohol use (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88-0.99). Gender was a significant effect modifier in associations between pain and alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use. The study was registered in the database of clinicaltrials.gov (register number NCT03936985). Perspective This study suggests that pain severity and interference are associated with increased use of non-medical prescription opioids, sedatives, and tobacco and decreased use of alcohol, in ways that are different between women and men. Findings may guide the development of gender-sensitive evidence-based strategies to ameliorate or prevent substance misuse among patients living with pain.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1738,35418019,"Improvement in prescriptions while maintaining overall health outcomes: a prospective observational study conducted in Japanese facilities for older people. BACKGROUND Improvements in the use of polypharmacy or potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) may reduce medication costs in Japan. We aimed to evaluate the impact of improvement in prescription on both overall health outcomes and medication costs in Japanese facilities for older people. METHODS Residents in Japanese facilities for older people between March 2019 and March 2020 were included in this study. The following five indices were used to evaluate overall health outcomes: EuroQoL-5D-5L, Barthel Index, Mini Mental State Examination, Dementia Behaviour Disturbance Scale, and Vitality Index. The team, which consisted of one physician and several pharmacists, suggested improved prescriptions for the attending physicians of the participants. The impact of improvement in prescriptions on the health outcomes score, medication costs, and the number of medications were evaluated through two comparison groups: those whose number of medications decreased (decrement group, DG) and those whose medications did not (not decrement group, NDG); those prescribed PIMs in March 2019 and those not prescribed PIMs in March 2020 (improvement group, IG) and those prescribed PIMs both in March 2019 and March 2020 (not improvement group, NIG). In both comparison groups, propensity score matching was performed to balance demographics, and all health outcome scores, medication costs, and the number of medications in March 2020 were assessed using a t-test. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of < 0.05. RESULTS Eight-hundred-and-ninety-one participants (75.5% women, 86.2 ± 7.9 years old) were enrolled. After matching, in the comparison between the DG (N = 232, 77.2%, 85.7 ± 8.5) and NDG (N = 232, 78.5%, 86.0 ± 3.1), changes in the health outcomes score were nonsignificant. However, the medication costs and the number of medications significantly decreased. After matching, in the comparison between IG (N = 141, 75.2%, 86.7 ± 8.1) and NIG (N = 273, 74.2%, 86.2 ± 8.3), changes in health outcome scores and medication costs were not significant. However, the number of medications significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS Improvements in prescriptions did not adversely affect the overall health outcomes. However, it impacted medication costs and the number of medications. Improvement in prescriptions could decrease medication costs while maintaining overall health outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1739,35418048,"If we build it, will they come? Perspectives on pharmacy-based naloxone among family and friends of people who use opioids: a mixed methods study. BACKGROUND Expanding access to the opioid antagonist naloxone to reduce overdose mortality is a public health priority in the United States. Naloxone standing orders (NSOs) have been established in many states to increase naloxone dispensing at pharmacies, but increased pharmacy access does not ensure optimal uptake among those likely to witness an overdose. In a prior statewide purchase trial, we documented high levels of naloxone access at Massachusetts pharmacies under a statewide NSO. In this study, we characterize barriers to pharmacy-based naloxone uptake among potential opioid overdose ""bystanders"" (friends or family of people who use opioids) that may be amenable to intervention. METHODS Eligible bystanders were Massachusetts residents ≥ 18 years of age, did not use illicit opioids in the past 30 days, and knew someone who currently uses illicit opioids. We used a sequential mixed methods approach, in which a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews (N = 22) were conducted April-July 2018, to inform the development of a subsequent quantitative survey (N = 260), conducted February-July 2020. RESULTS Most survey participants (77%) reported ever obtaining naloxone but few (21%) attempted to purchase it at a pharmacy. Qualitative participants revealed that barriers to utilizing the NSO included low perceived risk of overdose, which was rooted in misconceptions regarding the risks of prescription opioid misuse, denial about their loved one's drug use, and drug use stereotypes; inaccurate beliefs about the impact of naloxone on riskier opioid use; and concerns regarding anticipated stigma and confidentiality. Many participants had engaged in mutual support groups, which served as a source of free naloxone for half (50%) of those who had ever obtained naloxone. CONCLUSIONS Despite high levels of pharmacy naloxone access in Massachusetts, few bystanders in our study had attempted to obtain naloxone under the NSO. Low perceived risk of overdose, misinformation, stigma, and confidentiality were important barriers to pharmacy naloxone uptake, all of which are amenable to intervention. Support groups provided a setting for addressing stigma and misinformation and provided a discreet and comfortable setting for naloxone access. Where these groups do not exist and for bystanders who do not participate in such groups, pharmacies are well-positioned to fill gaps in naloxone availability.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1740,35418072,"Survey of the patients' perspectives and preferences in adopting telepharmacy versus in-person visits to the pharmacy: a feasibility study during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the health authorities recommended the implementation of strict social distancing and complete lockdown regulations to reduce disease spread. The pharmacists quickly adopted telemedicine (telepharmacy) as a solution against this crisis, but awareness about this technology is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to explore the patients' perspectives and preferences regarding telepharmacy instead of traditional in-person visits. METHODS An electronic questionnaire was designed and sent to 313 patients who were eligible for the study (from March to April 2021). The questionnaire used five-point Likert scales to inquire about motivations for adopting telepharmacy and in-person visits, their perceived advantages and disadvantages, and the declining factors of telepharmacy. Finally, the results were descriptively analyzed using SPSS 22. RESULTS Of all 313 respondents, a total of 241 (77%) preferred appointments via telepharmacy while 72 (23%) preferred in-person services. There was a significant difference between the selection percentage of telepharmacy and in-person services (chi-square 91.42; p < 0.0001). Preference bout the telepharmacy system versus in-person visits to the pharmacy was associated with factors such as ""reducing the incidence of contagious disease"" (4.41; ± 0.78), ""spending less time receiving pharmaceutical services"" (4.24; ± 0.86)), and ""traveling a shorter distance for receiving pharmaceutical services"" (4.25; ± 0.86). ""Reducing costs"" (90.87%), ""saving time"" (89.21%), and ""reducing the incidence of contagious disease"" (87.13%) were the most important reasons for choosing telepharmacy services. Also, ""face-to-face communication with the pharmacist"" (25%), ""low internet bandwidth"" (25%), and ""reduction of patients' anxiety and the increase of their peace of mind"" (23.61%) were the most important reasons for choosing in-person visits. CONCLUSION Survey data indicate that most participants are likely to prefer the use of telepharmacy, especially during crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Telepharmacy can be applied as an important means and a crucial service to lessen the load on healthcare organizations and expand drug supply shelters in pharmacies. However, there are still substantial hurdles to overcome in order to successfully implement the telemedicine platform as part of mainstream practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1741,35418269,"Simulation-Based Training to Improve Clinical Pharmacist Self-Efficacy in the Management of a Rapidly Decompensating Patient. BACKGROUND The optimal training method to prepare pharmacists as an integral rapid response team or cardiopulmonary arrest responders is poorly described. This study assessed the utility of simulation-based training (SBT) as a training technique for clinical pharmacists. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine if attending SBT is associated with an improvement in self-efficacy. METHODS This single-center, prospective, interventional cohort study offered three simulations to clinical pharmacists over the course of seven months at a 957-bed quaternary care academic medical center. Pharmacists who participated in at least one simulation were categorized in the intervention group and were compared to pharmacists who did not attend a simulation. All participants were asked to complete a 19-question self-efficacy survey in the form of a 100-point scale, a 15-question multiple-choice knowledge assessment, and a perception survey in the form of 4-point Likert scale administered at baseline and following the conclusion of the SBT. RESULTS Forty-four clinical pharmacists participated; 20 in the intervention group and 24 in the control group. Median change in self-efficacy score improved significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group (14.3 vs 2.3, P = .009). Median change in perception score improved significantly (2 vs 0, P = .046). Knowledge score did not change significantly from baseline. CONCLUSION Simulation-based training improved clinical pharmacist self-efficacy and perceptions in the care of rapidly decompensating patients. These findings support SBT as a viable modality of training clinical pharmacists for the management of rapidly decompensating patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1742,35418325,"Use of the job demands-resource model to understand community pharmacists' burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND Community pharmacists are one of the most accessible healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst playing a vital role in medication supply and patient education, exposure to the pandemic demands and prolonged stressors increase their risk of burnout. OBJECTIVES Using the Job Demands-Resources model, this study aims to understand the factors that led to community pharmacists' burnout and to identify their coping strategies and perceived recommendations on interventions to mitigate burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A qualitative phenomenological approach was used with focus groups and interviews of community pharmacists in Qatar who were recruited using purposeful, convenience, and snowballing sampling methods. Interviews were conducted between February and April 2021, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using thematic analysis methodology, manual inductive and deductive (based on the model) codes from the interviews were used for synthesis of themes. 11 themes emerged from six focus groups, six dyadic interviews and mini focus groups, and four individual interviews with community pharmacists. RESULTS The contributing factors to community pharmacists' burnout have been identified as practical job demands, and emotional demands including fear of infection. On the other hand, government and workplace-specific resources, personal characteristics such as resiliency and optimism, as well as the implementation of coping strategies, have reduced their stress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS The use of the Job Demands-Resources model was appropriate to identify the contributing factors to community pharmacists' burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these factors, individual, organizational, and national strategies can be implemented to mitigate burnout in community pharmacists during the pandemic and future emergencies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To assess the variation in bleeding risk estimates and risk stratification among Web and mobile applications for patients with atrial fibrillation. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Simulated patient population. PARTICIPANTS Hypothetical patient cohorts that encompassed all possible binary risk factor combinations for each clinical prediction model. INTERVENTIONS Twenty-five bleeding risk calculators (18 Web and 7 mobile apps), each of which used 1 of 4 clinical prediction models to predict an individual's 12-month bleed risk: ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation), HAS-BLED (hypertension [systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg], abnormal renal or liver function, stroke [caused by bleeding], bleeding, labile international normalized ratio, elderly [age >65 years], drugs [acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] or alcohol [≥8 drinks per week]), HEMORR2HAGES (hepatic or renal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older [age >75 years], reduced platelet count or function, rebleeding risk [history of past bleeding], hypertension [uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fall risk, and stroke), and mOBRI (modified Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Four simulated cohorts were constructed. The coefficient of variation, relative difference (RD), and 95% CI for annual bleeding risk estimates were calculated for all hypothetical patient cohorts. Additionally, pairwise agreement between calculators across low- (<10%), moderate- (10% to 20%), and high-risk (>20%) categories of patients was determined. RESULTS The risk estimates the calculators generated were imprecise, with coefficients of variation ranging from 14% for HEMORR2HAGES to 64% for mOBRI. Wide variation was observed in annual risk estimates for calculators using the mOBRI (maximum RD=4.3) and HAS-BLED (maximum RD=3.1) models. The 95% CI of mean annual bleeding risk varied among models; 1 calculator using the HAS-BLED model had a 95% CI of mean annual risk estimates of 5.4% to 6.2%, while another HAS-BLED calculator reported a 95% CI of 17.7% to 18.5%. Concordance for risk category stratification among calculators was high for those based on mOBRI and ATRIA (=1 for both). Poor agreement was observed in 1 calculator using HEMORR2HAGES (=0.54) and another using HAS-BLED ( range=-0.11 to 0.35). CONCLUSION Inconsistencies and a lack of precision were observed in annual risk estimates and risk stratification produced by Web and mobile bleeding risk calculators for patients with atrial fibrillation.

Pupose To explore the challenges of anticoagulation management (AMS) and assess the need for establishing a pharmacist-led anticoagulation clinic (PLAC) at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a qualitative study at TASH. Using a semistructured interview guide, we interviewed 15 physicians from different specialties, heads of pharmacy and laboratory departments. We also included 20 patients to explore their general perceptions, and experiences with and challenges of AMS; and the need to implement PLAC in the hospital. Results Only three physicians responded that they had protocols for initiating and maintaining warfarin dosing. Having protocols for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment, VTE prophylaxis and treatment, bleeding risk assessment, and contraindication to anticoagulant therapy were reported by seven, six, four, and three participants, respectively. Lack of trained healthcare professionals and a separate AMS clinic, inconsistency in INR testing and anticoagulant availability, and longer appointment times were the biggest challenges of the existing AMS, according to 80% of respondents. Fourteen patient respondents indicated that their satisfaction with the AMS was affected by long wait times and inconsistent availability of anticoagulants and INR testing. The head of the laboratory stated that the facilities for INR testing are inadequate and affect the quality of AMS and customer satisfaction, and supplemented by the head of the pharmacy by adding irregularities of supplies and inadequate counseling on anticoagulants. Respondents suggested that there is a need to establish a PLAC with well-adopted standard operating procedures, qualified manpower, adequate training of assigned staff, and sustained supply of anticoagulants and INR testing. Conclusion The hospital's AMS is not optimal to provide adequate services during the study period. Based on these findings and recommendations, the supporting literature, and the experiences of other facilities, the PLAC was established in TASH.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1746,35419335,"Mental Health and Psychotropic Stigma Among Student Pharmacists. Objective To gain a better understanding of student pharmacists' stigma toward mental health and psychotropic medications. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted via paper and online surveys amongst all student pharmacists enrolled in a Doctor of Pharmacy program in the Southeastern United States (n = 501). The Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination (PDD) Scale was used to measure mental health stigma. The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) was modified to measure psychotropic stigma. MANOVAs were conducted to investigate relationships between student pharmacists' characteristics with mental health and psychotropic stigma. A paired t-test was used to determine if there was a difference between degree of mental health stigma and psychotropic stigma. Results A total of 390 participants completed the survey (65%). The sample was mostly female (67%), white (79%), and non-Hispanic (96%). Ages were predominantly within the 19-24-year range (80%), and the majority of respondents reported previous interactions with patients who have mental health conditions (55%) or patients on psychotropic medications (65%). Student personal preferences for mental health treatment were primarily psychologic (42%) or both psychologic and psychotropic (40%). Degree of psychotropic stigma was significantly greater than that of mental health stigma. A statistically significant association was found between student personal preference for treatment and the psychotropic stigma. No difference was found in degree of either type of stigma across cohorts. Conclusions Student pharmacists demonstrated both mental health and psychotropic stigmas.

Background Type 2 Diabetes-related medication errors are frequently reported from the hospitals and consequently are of major concern. However, such reports are insufficient when developing healthcare settings are pursued in literature. Keeping this inadequacy in mind, we therefore aimed to explore physicians' perceptions, experiences and expectations of medication errors when managing patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Methods A qualitative design was adopted. By using a semi-structured interview guide through the phenomenology-based approach, in-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted. Physicians practicing at the medicine ward of Sandeman Provincial Hospital, Quetta, were purposively approached for the study. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and were then analyzed for thematic contents by the standard content analysis framework. Results Although the saturation was reached at the 13th interview, we conducted additional two interviews to ensure the saturation. Fifteen physicians were interviewed, and thematic content analysis revealed six themes and nine subthemes. Mixed conceptualization and characterization of medication errors were identified. Medication errors were encountered by all physicians however poor understanding of the system, deficiency of logistics and materials were rated as barriers in reporting medication errors. Among contributors of medication errors, physicians themselves as well as dispensing and patient-related factors were identified. Physicians suggested targeted training sessions on medication error-related guidelines and reporting system. Parallel, establishment of an independent unit, involving the pharmacists, and strict supervision of paramedics to minimize medication errors was also acknowledged during data analysis. Conclusion With a longer life expectancy and a trend of growing population, the incidences of medication errors are also expected to increase. Our study highlighted prescribing, dispensing and administration phases as contributing factors of medication errors. Although, physicians had poor understanding of medication errors and reporting system, they believed getting insights on guidelines and reporting system is essential. A review of admission and discharge reconciliation must be prioritized and a culture of teamwork, communication and learning from mistakes is needed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1748,35420749,"Pharmacist hypertension management using an electronic health record-based approach. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of the chronic medication optimization pharmacist (CMOP) program on blood pressure (BP) control and time to goal compared with usual care in the ambulatory care setting. STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study that included patients from June 2018 to June 2020 who were seen in an ambulatory care clinic for hypertension management. METHODS Patients aged 18 to 80 years were divided into 2 cohorts based on hypertension management by usual care or the CMOP program. Patients were enrolled in the CMOP program either by referral or identification via a data analytics tool. The primary outcome assessed the proportion of patients within BP goal (< 140/90 mm Hg) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes assessed the proportion of patients within goal at 6 months, time and number of visits to goal, and adherence (CMOP cohort only). RESULTS The primary end point demonstrated a greater proportion of patients within goal in the CMOP cohort compared with usual care (69.4% vs 42.3%; P < .001). The CMOP cohort also displayed a greater proportion of patients achieving goal within 6 months (75.7% vs 60.4%; P = .014) and faster time to goal (42.99 vs 63.12 days; P = .002), but more visits (1.67 vs 1.18; P = .001). Lastly, adherence improved from 50.4% to 72.1% in the patients with a documented adherence assessment in the pharmacist group (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist intervention improved BP control in a primarily African American patient population compared with usual care. Future studies should assess the sustainability of this intervention.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Cardiology,,,,Ambulatory,
1749,35421057,"A quality improvement initiative to improve the appropriateness of candidemia management by the implementation of a comprehensive candidemia care bundle at a tertiary care hospital in South India: Results of a quasi-experimental study. ABSTRACT Management of candidemia in developing countries like India encounters laxity in appropriate clinical management and challenges in terms of healthcare capacity, despite its association with high morbidity and mortality. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive candidemia care bundle implementation on appropriateness of therapy and major clinical outcomes.The single-center, quasi-experimental study conducted at a south Indian tertiary care center included adult patients diagnosed with candidemia. Following a retrospective review of candidemia patients of the pre-implementation period (January 2013-December 2015), the hospital antifungal stewardship team instituted a clinical pharmacist driven comprehensive candidemia care bundle for candidemia patients during the post-implementation period (October 2017-2019) and its impact on appropriateness of antifungal prescriptions and inpatient mortality was evaluated.The study included 175 patients with candidemia, comprising of 103 patients in the pre-implementation period and 72 patients in the post-implementation period. Appropriateness of antifungal prescriptions rose to 65% during post-implementation period from 30% observed in pre-implementation phase (P = .0005). The inhospital mortality rate reduced from 40% in the pre-implementation phase to 36% in the post-implementation phase, recording a 10% reduction over 2 years post-implementation (P = .26). No significant difference was observed in terms length of stay (P = .17).Our study demonstrates the successful implementation of an antifungal stewardship led comprehensive care bundle in a low middle income countries setting. The results of our study will have profound implications in improving the appropriateness of management of candidemia and feasibility of scaling up to wider settings could be explored.",1,1,0,0,1,Misread by reviewer 2,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
1750,35422008,"Association of adherence measured by self-reported pill count with achieved blood pressure level in hypertension patients: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Medication adherence plays an essential role in controlling blood pressure to reduce morbidity and mortality of hypertension disease. Thus, this study aimed to determine the association of medication adherence measured by self-reported pill count with blood pressure levels among patients at several community health centers in Surabaya. METHODS Adherence was assessed using the pill count method by comparing the total number of antihypertension drugs taken with the prescribed drugs. The inclusion criteria involved hypertensive patients who received antihypertension drugs, specifically adults and elderly, except the pregnant woman. The patient blood pressure was measured by healthcare workers in the targeted community health centers. Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with medication adherence with blood pressure levels. RESULTS A total of 264 hypertensive outpatients participating in this study, 77.65% of participants were adherent to antihypertensive drugs based on the pill count method, and 40.91% of participants had controlled blood pressure. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure were about six times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 6.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.694-14.039; P = 0.000) more likely to have non-adherent medication than patients with controlled blood pressure. Reciprocally, non-adherent participants (pill count < 80%) were about six times (AOR: 6.081; 95% CI: 2.672-13.838; P = 0.000) more likely to have uncontrolled blood pressure compared to adherent patients (pill count ≥ 80%). Age less than 40 years old (AOR: 5.814; 95% CI: 1.519-22.252; P = 0.01) and having middle school educational level (AOR: 0.387; 95% CI: 0.153-0.974; P = 0.045) were found to be independent factors associated with uncontrolled blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS The result showed that non-adherence to antihypertension drugs is associated with uncontrolled blood pressure. Then, age could be associated with uncontrolled blood pressure. Thus, pharmacists and other healthcare providers should pay attention to improving medication adherence and maintaining the controlled blood pressure.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1751,35422698,"Hypernatremia During Intravenous Treatment With Fosfomycin: A Retrospective Medical Record Review Study and an Analysis of Spontaneous Reports in the EudraVigilance Database.  Background: Hypernatremia is a serious event that can occur during intravenous (IV) treatment with fosfomycin, and it can also be caused by a wrong drug preparation. Considering the clinical significance of hypernatremia, we decided to carry out two studies by using two different data sources with the aim to evaluate cases of IV fosfomycin-induced hypernatremia. Methods: A retrospective medical record review was performed from June 2017 to June 2019 using data from two hospitals in Southern Italy. The information collected was related to the patients, the antibiotic treatment regimen, type of adverse drug reaction (ADR), hypernatremia severity classification, and drug withdrawal due to ADRs. Moreover, a pharmacovigilance study was performed from the date of the European marketing authorization of fosfomycin to October 11, 2021, using data reported on the European website of suspected ADRs. Information related to the patient characteristics, treatment, hypernatremia, and type of reporter was retrieved. Results: From the retrospective medical record review, a total of 62 patients (48 men and 14 women) in treatment with fosfomycin were identified, of which 17 experienced ADRs. Specifically, 11 patients experienced hypernatremia. During the period from June 2017 to June 2018, a total of 63.7% of hypernatremia events were related to the wrong reconstitution of the drug. According to these results, a surveillance and training campaign about the correct drug reconstitution was managed. However, from June 2018 to June 2019, we still had four new hypernatremia cases. Drug withdrawal occurred in only one patient with hypernatremia. From the pharmacovigilance study, a total of 25 cases of IV fosfomycin-induced hypernatremia were retrieved. No substantial difference was found for patients' distribution by sex. Most cases were classified as serious (68%) and reported ""Recovered/resolved"" as the outcome (44%). In the majority of cases, fosfomycin was the only suspected drug reported (72%). Conclusion: Our results show that training campaigns on the correct drug preparation need to be strengthened to allow a reduction of hypernatremia cases. Moreover, when close monitoring and management is performed by the infectious disease (ID) specialist and hospital pharmacist, there also is a reduction in antibiotic withdrawal due to hypernatremia.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1752,35426008,"Bridging the Gap in Tobacco Cessation Services: Utilizing Community Pharmacists to Facilitate Transitions of Care in the USA.  Interprofessional strategies for promoting tobacco cessation lead to enhanced quit rates among patients; however, current approaches might not effectively support patients with their quit attempts after they are discharged from the hospital. This paper explores opportunities for interprofessional collaboration between health system-based providers and community pharmacists, as one proposed approach to bridging tobacco cessation services during transitions of care. Suggested strategies include (1) increasing other healthcare professionals' awareness of legislative advances that permit pharmacists to prescribe cessation medications in some states, and (2) encouraging bi-directional communication between health system-based and community-based providers, especially via integrated electronic health records. Community pharmacists can offer a convenient solution to obtain the post-discharge medication and counseling support that patients need to increase their chances of quitting for good. Additional steps are discussed to improve broadscale capacity of this service being provided in community pharmacies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1753,35427359,"Robot-enhanced diabetes care for middle-aged and older adults living with diabetes in the community: A small sample size mixed-method evaluation. PURPOSE This study assessed robot-enhanced healthcare in practical settings for the purpose of community diabetes care. METHODS A mixed method evaluation collected quantitative and qualitative data on diabetes patients over 45 (N = 30) and community pharmacists (N = 10). It took 15-20 min for the diabetes patients to interact with the robot. Before and after the interaction, questionnaires including a diabetes knowledge test, self-efficacy for diabetes, and feasibility of use of the robot was administered. In-depth interviews with both pharmacists and patients were also conducted. RESULTS After interacting with the robot, a statistically significant improvement in diabetes knowledge (p < .001) and feasibility of the robot (p = .012) was found, but self-efficacy (p = .171) was not significantly improved. Five themes emerged from interviewing the diabetes patients: Theme 1: meets the needs of self-directed learning for the elderly; Theme 2: reduces alertness and creates comfortable interaction; Theme 3: vividness and richness enhance interaction opportunities; Theme 4: Robots are not without disadvantages, and Theme 5: Every person has unique tastes. Three themes emerged from interviewing pharmacists: Theme 1: Technology must meet the real needs of the patient; Theme 2: creates new services, and Theme 3: The use of robots must conform to real-life situations. CONCLUSIONS Both the diabetes patients and the pharmacist reported more positive feedback on the robot-enhanced diabetes care than concerns. Self-directed learning, comfortable interaction, and vividness were the most focuses when using robot to enhance self-management for the patients. Pharmacists were most receptive to fit conforming with reality and creating new services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1754,35427944,"The changing role of Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with older people during the COVID- 19 pandemic: A qualitative research study. BACKGROUND COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in December 2020. Advanced Clinical Practitioners (ACPs) in England working with older people with frailty, experienced their clinical role changing in response to the emergency health needs of this complex population group. In contrast to other countries, in England Advanced Clinical Practitioners are drawn from both nursing and allied health professions. Whilst much of the literature emphasises the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the Advanced Clinical Practitioners' role, the pandemic threw further light on its potential and challenges. However, an initial review of the literature highlighted a lack of research of Advanced Clinical Practitioners' capabilities working with uncertainty in disaster response situations. AIM To capture the lived experience of how English Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with older people adapted their roles in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2020-January 2021). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A qualitative research design was used. Following ethical approval, 23 Advanced Clinical Practitioner volunteer participants from across England with varied health professional backgrounds were recruited from Advanced Clinical Practitioners' professional and social media networks on Twitter using a snowballing technique. METHODS Depending on preference or availability, 23 participants (nurses (18), physiotherapists (2), paramedics (2) and a pharmacist (1)) were interviewed singularly (n = 9) or as part of 3 focus groups (n = 14) using Zoom video communication. Audio recordings were transcribed and using qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 12 pro, coded for an essentialist thematic analysis of Advanced Clinical Practitioners' responses using an inductive approach. 27 codes were identified and collated into five themes. For the purposes of this paper, four themes are discussed: experiencing different work, developing attributes, negotiating barriers and changing future provision. FINDINGS Advanced Clinical Practitioners successfully transferred their advanced practice skills into areas of clinical need during the pandemic. Their autonomous and generic, high level of expertise equipped them for management and leadership positions where speed of change, and the dissolution of traditional professional boundaries, were prioritised. Barriers to progress included a lack of knowledge of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner role and friction between Advanced Clinical Practitioners and physicians. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The study demonstrated the successful adaption of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner role to enable more creative, personalised and sustainable solutions in the care of older people living with frailty during the pandemic. The potential of Advanced Clinical Practitioner development is in a juxtaposition to the threat of pandemic services being dismantled once the emergency nature of care has passed. Healthcare organisations have a vital part to play in considering the enablers and barriers of Advanced Clinical Practitioner capability-based practice when responding to uncertainty.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1756,35428282,"Retrospective descriptive assessment of clinical decision support medication-related alerts in two Saudi Arabian hospitals. OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency of clinical decision support system (CDSS) medication-related alerts generated, accepted, or overridden, to assess appropriateness of alert display and overrides, and to characterise the documentation of clinician justification for these overrides in an academic medical centre in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS System-generated CDSS reports for the period June 2015 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed and analysed. Alerts were classified into different types, and rates of alert overrides calculated as percentages of all generated alerts. A subset of 307 overridden alerts was assessed for appropriateness of display and override by two clinical pharmacists. Physician documentation of reasons for overriding alerts were categorised. RESULTS A total of 4,446,730 medication-related alerts were generated from both inpatient and outpatient settings, and 4,231,743 (95.2%) were overridden. The most common alert type was 'duplicate drug', accounting for 3,549,736 (79.8%) of alerts. Of 307 alerts assessed for appropriateness, 246 (80%) were judged to be appropriately displayed and 244 (79%) were overridden appropriately. New drug allergy and drug allergy alerts had the highest percentage of being judged as inappropriately overridden. For 1,594,313 alerts (37.7%), 'no overridden reason selected' was chosen from the drop-down menu. CONCLUSIONS The alert generation and override rate were higher than reported previously in the literature. The small sample size of 307 alerts assessed for appropriateness of alert display and override is a potential limitation. Revision of the CDSS rules for alerts (focusing on specificity and relevance for the local context) is now recommended. Future research should prospectively assess providers' perspectives, and determine patient harm associated with overridden alerts.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1757,35428578,"Using qualitative, community-based input to steer post-coronavirus disease 2019 pharmacy practice in substance use. BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a disproportionately negative impact on individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD). A rapidly changing public health and treatment environment has resulted in increased needs for pharmacist engagement in SUD-focused patient care. OBJECTIVES This study used semistructured interviews of SUD professionals to evaluate where they believe pharmacy practice could better support people at risk of or having SUD in light of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Professionals dedicated to the care of individuals with SUD were recruited from a large community substance use coalition to participate in a qualitative study examining how pharmacists could take a more active role in SUD prevention, intervention, recovery, and harm reduction (HR). A consensual qualitative research approach was used in data analysis. RESULTS Domains identified in analysis included pharmacists as educators of patients and communities, pharmacists as educators of health care providers, pharmacists as advocates for individuals with SUD, the need for increased pharmacist engagement owing to COVID-19 challenges for individuals with SUD, the need for expanded pharmacy practice interventions, and the need for pharmacist self-development. CONCLUSION Increased medication counseling, HR practices, addressing stigma, and community-level education focused on SUD were among the most commonly reported areas for pharmacy practice development. In addition, the urgent need to adjust pharmacy practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was also identified by interviewees.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1758,35428579,"Designing a theory and evidence informed pharmacogenomic testing service in community pharmacy in England. INTRODUCTION Pharmacogenomics (PGx) uses DNA to predict an individual's response to a medicine. Internationally, the delivery of PGx is frequently via community pharmacies, who can take a saliva sample, send it off for analysis and contribute to the final clinical decision making. No similar service has been set up in England. AIM To identify the barriers, enablers and Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) to inform a service specification for delivery of a community pharmacy based PGx service in England. METHOD This qualitative co-design research study was designed in three stages using action-orientated theory-based frameworks and tools. The first stage mapped perceptions, barriers to, and enablers for, implementing a community pharmacy based PGx service, derived from a previous qualitative study onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The second stage utilised the Theory and Techniques Tool (TTT) to link the identified TDF domain with corresponding BCTs. The final stage used a Delphi survey followed by a Nominal Group Technique session to facilitate community pharmacists selecting their preferred BCTs to include in a service specification. RESULTS The existing qualitative data were mapped onto six TDF domains: Knowledge, Skills, Social/professional role and identity, Optimism, Beliefs about Consequences, and Environmental context and resources. Forty-six BCTs were identified using the TTT and the consensus methods resulted in nine selected BCTs: Review outcome goal(s), Feedback on behaviour, Instruction on how to perform behaviour, Demonstration of the behaviour, Credible source and Adding objects to the environment. CONCLUSION Using a range of action-orientated theoretical frameworks and tools, pragmatic BCTs have been identified as part of a co-design process, which can now be used as the basis to develop a service specification for the implementation of a PGx testing service in a community pharmacy setting in England.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1759,35428696,"A qualitative evaluation of weekly reflective practice sessions for the intensive care unit pharmacy team during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Despite well-being initially being high on the agenda for UK health organisations, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted significant gaps around provision for well-being of pharmacists in the UK. The COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) environment exposed pharmacists to mental, physical and emotional challenges, including high levels of patient mortality. OBJECTIVES To provide an account of the experience of pharmacists working within an ICU at a large National Health Service hospital who attended reflective practice sessions throughout the first wave of the pandemic. METHOD A retrospective, cross-sectional design was used to gather information from eight participants who had attended nine, 30-minute weekly reflective practice sessions. Participants were invited to complete a 10-item online self-report questionnaire. The responses from the questionnaire were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis. RESULTS Seven participants completed the self-report questionnaire. Thematic analysis of responses identified four themes: (1) permission: both professional and personal 'permission' was necessary for participants to be present for the reflective practice sessions and to attend to their own well-being; (2) containing safe space: reflective practice sessions offered a consistently secure environment from which to explore topics which created challenge, personally and/or professionally; (3) connectedness: the impact of these sessions on participants' relationships with other attendees, as individuals and the group as a whole; and (4) emotional experience: increased awareness of developments around their expression, processing and management of emotion as a result of attending the sessions. CONCLUSIONS This study provides new and important insights into the use of reflective practice for pharmacists working in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings demonstrate heterogeneity in the experience of distress, the need to support the pharmacy profession, and the need to provide opportunities for staff to connect safely with colleagues during such crises.

1760,35431000,"Insights into Chronic Lithium Toxicity - A Case Report. BACKGROUND Bipolar disorder is a chronic psychological disorder and lithium remains the mainstay of therapy. Lithium toxicity can be acute or chronic and the effects may be disabling or life-threatening. The presence of risk factors can increase the chances of lithium toxicity in a patient on long-term lithium therapy. We hereby report a case of chronic lithium toxicity in a patient with a known case of bipolar disorder. CASE PRESENTATION A 44-year-old female patient who is a known case of bipolar disorder presented with altered sensorium, seizures and renal insufficiency. On admission, the patient was severely dehydrated and the serum lithium level was 3.43mEq/L. Hemodialysis was performed and she improved gradually. CONCLUSION Over the years from its approval, lithium constantly proves to be effective in reducing suicidal rates in patients with bipolar disorder. However, its use is limited due to the risk of toxicity. The chances of developing toxicity are more in patients who are on long-term lithium therapy. Patients with high risk factors for toxicity should be monitored frequently as the effects of lithium toxicity can be fatal.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Although integrated care and care coordination are known to be beneficial for older adults' population, the specific tasks of a Care Coordinator (CC) for integrated care pathways for this population have not been studied in detail. Setting & Subjects The French national pilot program PAERPA provided an integrated care pathway for older adults. In North France, a CC was recruited to support patients and professionals. Objectives (i) To analyse the CC's tasks in an integrated care pathway for older patients, and (ii) to record perceptions on the CC's tasks among the participating general practitioners (GP) and community pharmacists. Design & Methods Qualitative, two-phase study: (i) Task analysis of the CC's tasks, to compare the planned and actual tasks; (ii) semi-structured interviews among GPs and community pharmacists involved in the pathway. Results (i) The task analysis showed that the CC's actual tasks differed from planned tasks. The CC was only meant to be involved in the early stages of the process; actually, the CC undertook more or even unforeseen tasks in coordination, communication, and administrative support throughout the care pathways. (ii) The 28 interviewed healthcare professionals considered the CC's tasks to be essential to the success of pathways. They appreciated the CC's administrative support. However, CC's tasks related to interprofessional communication, and patient and family information, were controversially perceived among GPs and pharmacists.

Objective The impact of pharmaceutical services on public health especially in regards to smoking cessation counseling can influence the rate of smoking cessation. The present study aims to evaluate prevalence, beliefs, and attitude of pharmacy students toward smoking habit and SC methods. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among pharmacy students at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia over 4-month period from May to August 2021. The survey consisted of 22-items focused on evaluating the prevalence, belief, and attitude toward smoking habits and smoking cessation methods. Data was descriptively analyzed using a statistical package for social science version 26 (SPSS). Results A total of 675 students completed the survey, among which 78.7 % were non-smokers and only 31.7% received education on the dangers of smoking. The most common methods of smoking cessation they heard of were consultation (58.6%), followed by use of electronic cigarettes (41.92 %) and Nicotine patch (40.7%). One-third of the surveyed students (36.8 %) agreed that specialized smoking cessation clinics enhance the efficacy of smoking cessation methods. The majority of students (80.6%) agreed to ban smoking in public places and 92.2% believed that tobacco sales to adolescents should be forbidden. Health professionals should actively participate and advise their patients to quit smoking as 89.8 % students agreed on that. Age and gender of students had significantly influenced the prevalence of smoking, history of smoking, frequency of smoking, efforts to quit smoking among smokers (p = 0.0001). Conclusion The prevalence of non-smokers among pharmacy students is encouraging, yet level of awareness about and usefulness of smoking cessation methods is unsatisfactory. Therefore, the study clearly highlights a great need for integrating smoking cessation programs in their academic curricula to prepare them for real-world practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1764,35433900,"Fijian Farmers' Attitude and Knowledge Towards Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in Livestock Production Systems-A Qualitative Study.  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue affecting humans and livestock. To mitigate AMR risks, responsible use of antimicrobials in livestock production systems have been advocated. Studies have reported patterns of antimicrobial use (AMU) in livestock production systems; however, there is limited information on the drivers of AMU and AMR. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and understand the attitude and knowledge of Fijian livestock farmers on AMU and AMR. Livestock farmers and managers from the Central and Western divisions of Viti Levu, Fiji were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling methods. Face-to-face one-to-one semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Interview questions were informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Interview transcripts were analyzed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis and deductively using the TPB framework. A total of 19 cattle and poultry farmers took part. Our analysis generated four themes: (1) Uninformed use of antimicrobials and unaware of AMR, (2) Safeguarding livestock and generating income source as primary motivators for using antimicrobials (3) Medicine shortage results in hoarding and self-prescribing, and (4) Farm decisions on AMU and livestock management influenced by foreign farmers and veterinarians. Livestock farmers used medicines in livestock production; however, they could not differentiate amongst different types of medicine, including antimicrobials. Antimicrobials were used to prevent diseases in livestock and promote production of food and financial security but without any awareness of the risks of AMR. Additionally, farmers hoarded and self-prescribed medicines. Farmers rationed antimicrobials by not completing the entire course of antibiotics to save them for future use. Based on past experiences, farmers expressed dissatisfaction with the veterinary services provided by the government. They sought help online and from foreign farmers and veterinarians. We propose the need for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes focused on promoting rational use of antimicrobials and awareness of AMR amongst farmers in the Fijian livestock production systems. These programmes need to consider the anthropological, socio-cultural, economic, and environmental factors driving AMU. Future studies are underway to explore the attitude and knowledge of Fijian veterinarians, para-veterinarians and pharmacists on AMU and AMR to gain a broader systems knowledge to inform the design of AMS programmes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1765,35434000,"Pharmacist-led standardization of total parenteral nutrition improves postoperative nutritional status in colorectal cancer patients. Background Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an essential treatment for patients who undergo abdominal surgery. Due to the gap of knowledge background between clinicians and pharmacists, the participation of the latter may improve TPN standardization. However, the impact on clinical outcome is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the impact of appropriacy and efficacy of TPN prescription, after a pharmacist-led TPN standardization program introduced. Methods A pharmacist-led TPN standardization program was introduced in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital and the clinical outcomes were assessed. The TPN standardization program includes a pre-established standard multidisciplinary evaluation standard, a computerized TPN management system and regular evaluations of TPN prescription performed by pharmacists. Any concerns were identified and improved via discussed with doctors. To evaluate the effect of pharmacists' intervention in nutritional status and postoperative complications, an observational before-and-after cohort study was performed. All patients admitted in hospital with colorectal cancer (CRC) and receiving abdominal surgery in June 2019 (pre-intervention cohort) and June 2020 (post-intervention cohort) were retrospectively analyzed. Nutritional status of patients was evaluated using the levels of postoperative serum albumin, prealbumin, total protein, and their decrease extent. Surgical or TPN-related complications and recovery time were collated as the clinical outcomes. Results There were no significant differences in the basic clinical information of the two cohorts, suggesting that the two groups are comparable. The average postoperative prealbumin levels were elevated in 2020 compared to 2019 (192.3±5.5 mg/L for 2019 and 229.5±4.8 mg/L for 2020, P<0.001). In addition, the post-intervention cohort showed a lower postoperative infection rate (11.6% vs. 18.2%), shorter duration of infection (9.4±1.4 vs. 7.7±1.0 days), lower incidence of postoperative albumin decrease (25.2% vs. 76.7%), prealbumin decrease (71.5% vs. 78.9%), and total protein decrease (25.2% vs. 72.2%), and lower incidence of TPN-related hypoglycemia (5.4% vs. 15.3%).

The main objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence and compare the levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress experienced by the frontline health care workers (HCWs) during the lockdown and post lockdown periods at Apollo Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Hyderabad, India. All participants involved in the study were evaluated by using depression, anxiety and stress scale 21, the impact of event scale revised scale for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a standardized questionnaire. During the lockdown period, the score for depression was observed mean scores to be more in front desk people (2.70) followed by pharmacists and technicians (2.60) and security (2.28) in the lockdown period. During the lockdown, the highest levels of anxiety were seen in security staff (4.72) and housekeeping (4.8), with a considerable increase after the lockdown situation. During the lockdown period, the mean score of pharmacists and technicians (10.33) were more stressed than other HCWs, and the second-highest levels of stress were observed in security (10.11) and front desk workers (10.09), respectively. Our results show that there was a worsening of the psychological impact of the pandemic and an increase in PTSD, stress, anxiety, and depression among HCWs. Female gender, pharmacists, and technicians were the most vulnerable group to develop psychiatric comorbidities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1767,35435816,"Longitudinal evaluation of pharmacists' social distance preference and attitudes toward patients with opioid misuse following an educational training program.  Background: Pharmacist stigma via examination of social distance preference and negative attitudes toward persons who misuse opioids is prevalent and may lower the quality of care provided to patients. Few studies have previously extended beyond the immediate post-intervention period to examine stigma change. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study utilized a pre-survey administered before the training program, a post-survey immediately upon completion of the training program, and a delayed post-survey, administered 12 months after the training program. Co-primary outcomes were changes in social distance scale (SDS) total score from baseline to post-survey and from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included change in SDS question scores and change in negative attitudes. One hundred eighty-seven of the 1211 eligible pharmacists in the state completed the training. Matched responses of forty-four pharmacists who completed all three surveys were examined. Results: The mean total SDS score was significantly lower in the immediate post-training survey than the pre-training mean (14.75 vs. 16.57, p = .000). The 12 months mean total SDS score was also significantly lower than the pre-training mean (15.32 vs. 16.57, p = .017). Significant changes in negative attitudes from baseline to post-survey and from baseline to 12 months were seen. Conclusion: Stigma reduction components integrated into opioid training decreased pharmacist social distance preference and negative attitudes toward patients who misuse opioids immediately after the training and, most notably, were sustained for 12 months.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1768,35435960,"Stability implications of repackaged medications in dose administration aids: a systematic review. BACKGROUND Dose administration aids (DAAs) or multi-compartment compliance aids are commonly used to organise doses of medications in accordance with a patient's dosing schedule. Despite their widespread use, there is a paucity of information on the stability of repackaged medications in DAAs. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this work were to evaluate stability studies conducted on repackaged medicine in DAAs and to provide a summary of the latest stability data available. METHODS A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was performed on studies associated with repackaged medications in DAAs and drug stability. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and SCOPUS were searched from January 1998 to June 2021. KEY FINDINGS A total of 342 articles were retrieved and 29 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data regarding medications from the reviewed papers were reported according to stability testing and physicochemical properties. The extracted data were then compared with stability information on DAA provision available on the database in the UK. This review identified several discrepancies between this dataset and reported stability and reveals a significant shortage in the stability data of medications repackaged in DAAs. CONCLUSION This review highlights the need for further studies to be conducted to better understand the impact of DAA repackaging on the stability, safety and efficacy of medications. It is recommended that a database of stability information of repackaged medications via systematic stability testing studies could be established, serving as a valuable resource for pharmacists when preparing DAAs without compromising patient safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1769,35436887,"Would they accept it? An interview study to identify barriers and facilitators to user acceptance of a prescribing advice service. OBJECTIVES Few studies have explored the factors influencing user uptake of interventions designed to enhance therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to acceptance of a pilot intervention, the TDM Advisory Service (the Service), that provided prescribing advice for the antibiotic, vancomycin at an Australian public hospital. METHODS A sample of prescribers and pharmacists who had interacted with the Service (n = 10), and a sample who had not (n = 13), participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed independently by two researchers for emerging themes. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to synthesise barriers and facilitators to Service acceptance. RESULTS Key barriers reported by participants who had interacted with the Service aligned with two TDF domains: 'Social Influences' (prescribing hierarchy) and 'Environmental Context and Resources' (accessibility of dose advice). For participants who had not interacted with the Service, key barriers aligned with two TDF domains: 'Knowledge' (uncertainty of Service processes) and 'Environmental Context and Resources' (accessibility of dose advice). Key facilitators for both participant groups aligned with 'Beliefs about Consequences' (improved prescribing and patient outcomes) and 'Environmental Context and Resources' (accessibility of dose advice). A novel domain, 'Trust', was identified. CONCLUSIONS Independent of participant interaction with the Service, knowledge of Service processes, perceived beneficial outcomes, improved accessibility, and trust in Service capabilities were key determinants of acceptance. This evidence can be used to inform the adoption of strategies to adapt and enhance integration of the Service into clinical workflow.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1770,35436946,"Using modeling and scenario analysis to support evidence-based health workforce strategic planning in Malawi. BACKGROUND A well-trained and equitably distributed workforce is critical to a functioning health system. As workforce interventions are costly and time-intensive, investing appropriately in strengthening the health workforce requires an evidence-based approach to target efforts to increase the number of health workers, deploy health workers where they are most needed, and optimize the use of existing health workers. This paper describes the Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH) and collaborators' data-driven approach to designing strategies in the Human Resources for Health Strategic Plan (HRH SP) 2018-2022. METHODS Three modelling exercises were completed using available data in Malawi. Staff data from districts, central hospitals, and headquarters, and enrollment data from all health training institutions were collected between October 2017 and February 2018. A vacancy analysis was conducted to compare current staffing levels against established posts (the targeted number of positions to be filled, by cadre and work location). A training pipeline model was developed to project the future available workforce, and a demand-based Workforce Optimization Model was used to estimate optimal staffing to meet current levels of service utilization. RESULTS As of 2017, 55% of established posts were filled, with an average of 1.49 health professional staff per 1000 population, and with substantial variation in the number of staff per population by district. With current levels of health worker training, Malawi is projected to meet its establishment targets in 2030 but will not meet the WHO standard of 4.45 health workers per 1000 population by 2040. A combined intervention reducing attrition, increasing absorption, and doubling training enrollments would allow the establishment to be met by 2023 and the WHO target to be met by 2036. The Workforce Optimization Model shows a gap of 7374 health workers to optimally deliver services at current utilization rates, with the largest gaps among nursing and midwifery officers and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS Given the time and significant financial investment required to train and deploy health workers, evidence needs to be carefully considered in designing a national HRH SP. The results of these analyses directly informed Malawi's HRH SP 2018-2022 and have subsequently been used in numerous planning processes and investment cases in Malawi. This paper provides a practical methodology for evidence-based HRH strategic planning and highlights the importance of strengthening HRH data systems for improved workforce decision-making.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1771,35436957,"Assessment of an intensive education program for pharmacists on treatment of tobacco use disorder using an objective structured clinical examination: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND Tobacco use is one of the major public health threats globally. Community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to offer tobacco cessation services owing to their easy accessibility by the public. To prepare Qatar community pharmacists to develop the competencies and skills required to offer smoking cessation services, an intensive tobacco control education program was designed and implemented. The study aimed to assess the impact of the tobacco education program on the pharmacists' skills and competence. METHODS A random sample of community pharmacists in Qatar was chosen for participation in the program. Consenting participants were randomly assigned to either intervention or control groups. The intervention group received an intensive education program on treatment of tobacco-use disorder, while a short didactic session on a non-tobacco-related topic was delivered to the control group. The pharmacists' tobacco cessation skills and competencies were assessed using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). RESULTS A total of 54 and 32 community pharmacists in the intervention group and the control group, respectively, completed the OSCE. The intensive tobacco education group achieved significantly higher total scores than the control group in all the OSCE cases. Specifically, the mean total scores for the intervention group were 15.2, 15.3, 14.2, 14.6, 16.3, and 15.2 compared to 8.8, 6.2, 7.7, 9.2, 8.3, and 11.3 for the control group (p < 0.001) for cases one to six respectively. CONCLUSION The study demonstrated that an intensive tobacco cessation education program can improve pharmacists' tobacco cessation skills and increase their tobacco cessation counseling abilities.

1772,35438472,"Impact of a clinical pharmacist on medication safety in mental health Hospital-in-the-Home: a retrospective analysis.  Background Integration of clinical pharmacists into multidisciplinary Mental Health Hospital-in-the-Home teams is increasing but little is known about the medication safety contribution these pharmacists make. Aim To evaluate whether clinical pharmacist involvement in a Mental Health Hospital-in-the-Home service improved medication safety key performance indicators. Method Medical records were retrospectively reviewed of all patients admitted to 2 Western Australian Mental Health Hospital-in-the-Home services from September to November 2015. Site 1 was a 16-bed service incorporating a clinical pharmacist as part of its multidisciplinary team. Site 2 was a similarly structured 18-bed service but without clinical pharmacist involvement. The primary outcome measure was completion of medication safety key performance indicators obtained from the Western Australian Government Pharmaceutical Review Policy and mental health-specific best practice guidelines. Results Key performance indicators from Site 1 (n = 75 records), which incorporated a clinical pharmacist, demonstrated significantly (p < 0.001) higher rates of completion of medication reconciliation [65 (87%) versus 17 (29%)], accurate adverse drug reaction list [73 (97%) versus 34 (58%)], accurate discharge medication list [51 (74%) versus 18 (45%)], accurate medication profile [74 (99%) versus 40 (68%)] and medication chart review [74 (99%) versus 0 (0%)] than Site 2 (n = 59).

1773,35439284,"Evaluation of β-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring among US health systems with postgraduate year 2 infectious diseases pharmacy residency programs. PURPOSE While some guidelines recognize the need for β-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), there is still a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of and barriers to performing β-lactam TDM in the United States. We sought to estimate the prevalence of β-lactam TDM, describe monitoring practices, and identify actual and perceived barriers to implementation among health systems in the US. METHODS A multicenter, cross-sectional, 40-item electronic survey was distributed to all postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) infectious diseases (ID) pharmacy residency program directors (RPDs) listed in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists pharmacy residency directory. The primary outcome was the percentage of institutions with established β-lactam TDM. Secondary outcomes included assessing β-lactam TDM methods and identifying potential barriers to implementation. RESULTS The survey was distributed to 126 PGY2 ID RPDs, with a response rate of 31.7% (40 of 126). Only 7.7% of respondents (3 of 39) performed β-lactam TDM. Patient populations, therapeutic targets, and frequency and timing of obtaining repeat β-lactam concentration measurements varied among institutions. The greatest barrier to implementation was lack of access to testing with a rapid turnaround time. Institutions were unlikely to implement β-lactam TDM within the next year but were significantly more inclined to do so within 5 years (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Β-lactam TDM was infrequently performed at the surveyed US health systems. Lack of access to serum concentration testing with rapid turnaround and lack of US-specific guidelines appear to be considerable barriers to implementing β-lactam TDM. Among institutions that have implemented β-lactam TDM, there is considerable variation in monitoring approaches.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1774,35439812,"Implementation of a pharmacy residency resiliency program for PGY1 and PGY2 residents: Program structure and resident perceptions. PURPOSE To describe the implementation of a pharmacy residency resiliency program (PRRP) for postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) and postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) pharmacy residents, including program structure, strengths and weaknesses/limitations, resident perceptions as captured by a postprogram survey, generalizability to other institutions, and opportunities for future directions. SUMMARY Pharmacy residents face significant pressure, workload, and stressors that put them at risk for burnout and depression. While resiliency has been a major area of focus to help combat these risks for healthcare professionals, little has been published regarding formal, structured resiliency training in pharmacy, especially in pharmacy residency programs. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) residency standards recommend that programs consider education related to burnout prevention and that mitigation strategies be provided to residents and other pharmacy personnel, but no formal pharmacy-specific programs or strategies have been established. We implemented a 12-month PRRP for PGY1 and PGY2 pharmacy residents and conducted a postprogram survey to assess resident perceptions and to identify areas for growth. CONCLUSION Implementation of a PRRP was feasible and could be replicated at other institutions. Residents in our program reported a high level of satisfaction, skills gained, and positive attributes of the addition of the PRRP. Some notable factors contributing to success included the program's longitudinal nature, use of a nonpharmacy facilitator, and impactful content from an established resiliency skills curriculum.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1775,35440223,"Initiating Primary Care Services when the World Is Paused: Lessons for Pharmacists in the Post-COVID-19 Era.  The COVID-19 pandemic impacted primary care and required pharmacists to adapt when implementing primary care services. Many lessons learned through this process are applicable in the post-pandemic era. First, primary care pharmacists must prepare for an ever-changing role and communicate with stakeholders to align with shifting institutional priorities. Additionally, designing a workflow given limited staffing and in-person communication require flexibility for scheduling and referral processes. Proactive outreach and communication via virtual platforms may be used to build trust in place of in-office interactions with providers. Lastly, fostering relationships with patients is essential to the success of the service and often requires creation of patient-centered goals to account for personal barriers. Many pandemic obstacles are transient; however, telehealth, virtual communication, and the subsequent lessons learned in adaptability, creativity, and flexibility when building a clinic practice are everlasting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1776,35440225,"Pharmacists' practices and views regarding management of sexual health in patients with cancer. INTRODUCTION Sexual health issues associated with cancer can significantly impact patients' psychosocial well-being and overall quality of life. These issues are frequently medication-related, placing pharmacists in an opportune position to manage sexual health concerns in patients with cancer. Currently, no literature exists exploring pharmacists' practices related to the management of sexual health in oncology patients. METHODS An anonymous, descriptive, cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted to elicit pharmacists' views and practices regarding managing sexual health in oncology patients. Pharmacists practicing in Canada who provide care to adult malignant hematology or oncology patients were eligible to participate. The survey was disseminated through the Canadian Association of Pharmacy in Oncology and through informal oncology pharmacy practitioner networks. RESULTS Of the 102 pharmacists who participated, 96 completed the survey in its entirety. Most respondents were female, practiced in Alberta, and primarily saw oncology patients in outpatient cancer facilities. Although 85% of participants felt pharmacists should be involved in giving patients an opportunity to discuss sexual health, only 8% reported managing sexual health in at least 50% of their oncology patients. The most commonly agreed upon barriers to this were presence of family members and friends at appointments, lack of knowledge or training, limited time, and the belief that sexual health is not applicable to all oncology patients. CONCLUSIONS This study explored pharmacists' views and practices regarding managing sexual health in patients with cancer. Several barriers were identified, which may aid in future development of resources to assist pharmacists in routinely addressing sexual health in oncology patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1777,35440429,"Protocol for a pilot and feasibility study of nurse practitioner-pharmacist telehealth collaboration to simplify complex medication regimens. INTRODUCTION New and flexible multidisciplinary workforce models are needed to address unnecessary medication regimen complexity in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). This study will investigate the feasibility of a nurse practitioner-pharmacist telehealth-based collaborative care model to simplify complex medication regimens. METHODS This is a pragmatic, non-randomized pilot and feasibility study of up to 30 permanent residents from 4 RACFs in Western Australia. Simplification will be conducted in accordance with a validated 5-step implicit process. Nurse practitioners will identify residents potentially interested in and who may benefit from simplification, including any regulatory or safety imperatives that might preclude simplification. Medication regimens will be assessed by an off-site clinical pharmacist to identify opportunities for simplification in terms of drug-drug, drug-food, or drug-time interactions, and the availability of alternative formulations. The pharmacist will communicate simplification opportunities to nurse practitioners via video case conferencing. Nurse practitioners will then discuss simplification opportunities with the resident, caregiver and the health and care team, including any unintended consequences for the resident or RACF. The primary outcome measure will be feasibility (stakeholder acceptability, protocol adherence, recruitment and retention rates). Secondary outcomes include change in the number of medication administration times per day, medication and behavioral incidents, falls and fractures, hospitalization and mortality at 4 months.

BACKGROUND Drug-referencing apps are among the most frequently used by emergency health professionals. To date, no study has analyzed the quantity and quality of apps that provide information on emergency drugs. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify apps designed to assist emergency professionals in managing drugs and to describe and analyze their characteristics. METHODS We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study of apps that provide information on drugs for adult emergency care. The iOS and Android platforms were searched in February 2021. The apps were independently evaluated by 2 hospital clinical pharmacists. We analyzed developer affiliation, cost, updates, user ratings, and number of downloads. We also evaluated the main topic (emergency drugs or emergency medicine), the number of drugs described, the inclusion of bibliographic references, and the presence of the following drug information: commercial presentations, usual dosage, dose adjustment for renal failure, mechanism of action, therapeutic indications, contraindications, interactions with other medicinal products, use in pregnancy and breastfeeding, adverse reactions, method of preparation and administration, stability data, incompatibilities, identification of high-alert medications, positioning in treatment algorithms, information about medication reconciliation, and cost. RESULTS Overall, 49 apps were identified. Of these 49 apps, 32 (65%) were found on both digital platforms; 11 (22%) were available only for Android, and 6 (12%) were available only for iOS. In total, 41% (20/49) of the apps required payment (ranging from €0.59 [US $0.64] to €179.99 [US $196.10]) and 22% (11/49) of the apps were developed by non-health care professionals. The mean weighted user rating was 4.023 of 5 (SD 0.71). Overall, 45% (22/49) of the apps focused on emergency drugs, and 55% (27/49) focused on emergency medicine. More than half (29/47, 62%) did not include bibliographic references or had not been updated for more than a year (29/49, 59%). The median number of drugs was 66 (range 4 to >5000). Contraindications (26/47, 55%) and adverse reactions (24/47, 51%) were found in only half of the apps. Less than half of the apps addressed dose adjustment for renal failure (15/47, 32%), interactions (10/47, 21%), and use during pregnancy and breastfeeding (15/47, 32%). Only 6% (3/47) identified high-alert medications, and 2% (1/47) included information about medication reconciliation. Health-related developer, main topic, and greater amount of drug information were not statistically associated with higher user ratings (P=.99, P=.09, and P=.31, respectively). CONCLUSIONS We provide a comprehensive review of apps with information on emergency drugs for adults. Information on authorship, drug characteristics, and bibliographic references is frequently scarce; therefore, we propose recommendations to consider when developing an app of these characteristics. Future efforts should be made to increase the regulation of drug-referencing apps and to conduct a more frequent and documented review of their clinical content.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1780,35442213,"Behavioral Health Professionals' Perceptions on Patient-Controlled Granular Information Sharing (Part 2): Focus Group Study. BACKGROUND Patient-directed selection and sharing of health information ""granules"" is known as granular information sharing. In a previous study, patients with behavioral health conditions categorized their own health information into sensitive categories (eg, mental health) and chose the health professionals (eg, pharmacists) who should have access to those records. Little is known about behavioral health professionals' perspectives of patient-controlled granular information sharing (PC-GIS). OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess behavioral health professionals' (1) understanding of and opinions about PC-GIS; (2) accuracy in assessing redacted medical information; (3) reactions to patient rationale for health data categorization, assignment of sensitivity, and sharing choices; and (4) recommendations to improve PC-GIS. METHODS Four 2-hour focus groups and pre- and postsurveys were conducted at 2 facilities. During the focus groups, outcomes from a previous study on patients' choices for medical record sharing were discussed. Thematic analysis was applied to focus group transcripts to address study objectives. RESULTS A total of 28 health professionals were recruited. Over half (14/25, 56%) were unaware or provided incorrect definitions of granular information sharing. After PC-GIS was explained, all professionals demonstrated understanding of the terminology and process. Most (26/32 codes, 81%) recognized that key medical data had been redacted from the study case. A majority (41/62 codes, 66%) found the patient rationale for categorization and data sharing choices to be unclear. Finally, education and other approaches to inform and engage patients in granular information sharing were recommended. CONCLUSIONS This study provides detailed insights from behavioral health professionals on granular information sharing. Outcomes will inform the development, deployment, and evaluation of an electronic consent tool for granular health data sharing.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Drug-related problems (DRPs) could affect patient care and lead to deleterious manifestations, therefore, this investigation aimed to review the recently published studies concerning DRPs to improve their availability to clinical pharmacists, hoping that this information will be supportive and relevant to their practice settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of Elsevier, Sage, Springer/Nature, and Wiley online libraries on Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB) was limited to the cumulative period from 1/1/2015 to 20/10/2020. The abstracts of 156 articles were critically reviewed and 50 articles were included based on relevance while excluding books. The selected articles reported DRPs and different strategies to reduce them. Moreover, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in various patient populations were confirmed by many articles. Additionally, potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) predisposing factors were reported by others. RESULTS: 24 articles (48%) illustrated DDIs, 5 articles (10%) demonstrated ADRs, 4 articles (8%) showed medication errors (MEs), and 25 articles (50%) revealed efforts to reduce DRPs. The psychiatric population is at the utmost risk of pDDIs. Polypharmacy was the furthest recurrently reported risk factor related to DDIs. Adverse drug events (ADEs) increased healthcare costs. Different strategies to avoid DRPs were published through the stated period.

RESULTS Respondents from all HBPC roles were included in the study: Registered Nurses, Psychologists, Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner, Social Workers, Dietician, Occupational Therapists, Pharmacists, Physical Therapists, HBPC Program Director, HBPC Medical Director, MD, Physician Assistants, Other. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed 3 themes describing VA HBPC team members' experiences discussing and administering the COVID-19 vaccine: communication and education, advocating for prioritization of HBPC Veterans to receive the vaccine, and logistics of delivering and administering the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our study findings highlight the multifaceted experiences of VA HBPC team members discussing and administering initial doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to primarily homebound Veterans. Although the VA's HBPC program offers an example of a singular health care system, insights from more than 70 sites from across the United States reveal key lessons around the internal and external structures required to successfully support programs and their staff in providing these key activities. These lessons include proactively addressing the needs of homebound populations in national vaccine rollouts and developing vaccine education and training programs for HBPC team members specifically aligned to HBPC program needs. These lessons can extend to non-VA organizations who care for similar homebound populations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1788,35443829,"Consensus-led recommendations supporting choice and personalisation of Hormone replacement therapy in menopause care. OBJECTIVE Inequity of access and choice to different hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products across the UK has been suggested (Hillman, 2020). While, the cause is not entirely understood, potential contributors include conflicting national guidance, economic deprivation and a local formulary approach. With a diverse and growing population of women reaching and living well beyond the menopause, the impact of this inequity is becoming more pronounced, and challenges the goal of providing personalised care. The study objective is to establish a consensus that supports a greater equity of access and choice of HRT and provision of individualised care. STUDY DESIGN Modified Delphi study designed by UK HCPs with expertise in menopause care. This group identified 40 consensus statements over four key topics, related to access and choice of different HRT products. An online 4-point Likert scale questionnaire, sent to UK HCPs, was used to assess agreement, with a consensus threshold set at 75%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES 150 HCP responses between June and September 2021. RESULTS A total of 137 responses were received. Analysis identified 37/40 statements attaining very high agreement (≥ 90%) and 3/40 statements attaining high agreement (< 90% and ≥75%). Nine recommendations were developed with the intent to inform potential improvements to menopause care in the UK. CONCLUSIONS The high levels of agreement displayed suggest a desire to change the way menopause care is delivered in the UK. Implementation of the suggested recommendations has the potential to improve equity of access to licensed treatment options, compliant with the NICE recommendation for personalisation of care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Preemptive skin treatment led by nurses and pharmacists was started for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)who received anti-EGFR antibody treatment. Incidence of skin-related toxicities, amount of topical moisturizers used, and administered cycles of anti-EGFR antibody were retrospectively compared between a preemptive skin treatment group and a control group. Thirty-four mCRC patients before the introduction of preemptive skin treatment led by nurses and 23 mCRC patients treated with preemptive skin treatment led by nurses were evaluated. The incidence of 6- and 12- week Grade 2 or higher skin-related toxicity was 23.5% in the control group and 8.7% in the preemptive group(p=0.18), and 67.7% in the control group and 30.4% in the preemptive group(p=0.0076), respectively.

1791,35445311,"Exploring the impact of suicide care experiences and post-intervention supports sought among community pharmacists: a cross-sectional survey. BACKGROUND There is a need to appropriately train, support and remunerate pharmacists for their expanding roles in mental healthcare. Pharmacists often care for people experiencing mental health crises, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, but little is known about pharmacists' suicide care experiences. AIM This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the impact of professional experiences with people at risk of suicide and support accessed, among community pharmacists. METHOD A survey exploring pharmacists' experiences with people at risk of suicide and post-intervention support-seeking was disseminated through Australian and Canadian professional associations, conferences and social media (June 2016-May 2017). Quantitative data were analysed using Chi-squared, Fisher's exact and independent t-tests, where appropriate. Qualitative data exploring the impact of these experiences were thematically analysed, and reasons for not seeking help post-intervention were identified. RESULTS Among 378 respondents, 84% had encountered patients at risk of suicide and 28% had lost patients to suicide. Some were negatively affected personally and/or professionally (11%), of which 88% did not seek professional support, mainly due to uncertainty about available services. Pharmacists were significantly more negatively affected if they had a personal mental health diagnosis (p = 0.017) and previous suicide care experiences (p = 0.001). Qualitative themes included: expanding knowledge and skills, role limitation and emotional impact and response. CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of pharmacists have interacted with suicidal patients and are impacted by these experiences, yet few seek help due to lack of awareness and access. There is a need to recognize pharmacists' roles in suicide care, and develop pharmacist-specific post-intervention support.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1792,35446953,"Predictors of Receipt of Comprehensive Medication Reviews in Older Adults. BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is highly prevalent among older adults. This study's purpose was to provide nationally representative estimates of self-reported comprehensive medication review (CMR) receipt among older adults and describe factors associated with their receipt, as CMRs are available through the Medicare Part D program. METHODS This cross-sectional study used data from the National Poll on Healthy Aging (NPHA), a nationally representative online survey of community-dwelling adults aged 50-80, administered in December 2019. Participants included older adults aged 65-80 with any health insurance (n = 960). Outcomes were self-reported CMR receipt, awareness of CMR insurance coverage, and interest in a future CMR with a pharmacist. Sociodemographic and health-related variables were included. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression with NPHA population sampling weights were used. RESULTS Among older adults on two or more prescription medications, only 20.8% had received a CMR while 34.3% were interested in a future CMR. Among individuals who had not received a CMR, most (83.4%) were unaware their insurance might cover a CMR. Factors associated with higher odds of receiving a CMR included taking five or more prescription medications (AOR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.59-4.38) and reporting food insecurity (AOR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.07-7.93). Having fair or poor self-reported physical health was associated with lower odds of receiving a CMR (AOR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.97). CONCLUSIONS Most older adults on two or more prescription medications with health insurance had not received a CMR and many were interested in one. Targeted strategies to increase older adults' awareness and receipt of CMRs are warranted.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1793,35448700,"Virtualized Gamified Pharmacy Simulation during COVID-19.  Extended and immersive gamified pharmacy simulation has been demonstrated to provide transformative learning in pharmacy education, preparing graduates for real-world practice. An international consortium of universities has implemented local adaptations of the Pharmacy Game into their curricula. From early 2020, pharmacy academics modified the delivery of gamified simulation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while still aiming to deliver the important learning outcomes of enhanced communication, collaboration, confidence and competence. Australian universities went into full lockdown from March 2020, and the critical gamified simulation at Griffith University was delivered entirely virtually in 2020. An array of synchronous and asynchronous approaches and software platforms was employed, including Microsoft Teams, Forms and Stream plus the online interview platform Big Interview. These allowed for the simulation activities, including dispensing, counselling and clinical cases, to be conducted by students online. In 2021, Griffith University conducted hybrid delivery of its Pharmacy Game, balancing student participation both in person and online. Microsoft Power Apps was added to the hosting platform to enhance the simulation interface, and Power Virtual Agent artificial intelligence chatbots, with natural language processing, were used to enable asynchronous clinical interaction. The combination of learning technologies provided the means to deliver successful gamified simulation in the virtual and hybrid environments while still achieving outstanding learning outcomes from the capstone activity.

1794,35448703,"Impact of a Prepharmacy Program on Students' Self-Awareness of Pharmacist Professional Identity: Comparison between Virtual and In-Person Settings.  Ensuring an adequate preparation for undergraduate students transitioning to pharmacy school is challenging. A significant barrier is changing from a subordinate to a critical thinking mindset while self-identifying as a professional. Here, we aimed to (1) determine whether our prepharmacy program called ""Professional Identity and Me"" (PRIME) could enhance learners' self-awareness of their professional identity and (2) compare the effectiveness of the in-person and online versions of PRIME. PRIME introduced prepharmacy students to aspects of pharmacists' professional identity including community, hospital, and interprofessional work, as well as mental health, wellness, and time and stress management skills, Top-200 drugs, prerequisite foundational sciences, and calculations. Concepts of professionalism, graduate writing, and ownership were also presented. Bridging exercises were introduced to exemplify application. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess the outcomes. The average performance in knowledge-based assessments increased before and after the PRIME program from 53.8 to 74.6% and from 47.7 to 75.9%, while the difference in the test scores was statistically significant, with a 21% increase (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 15-26%) and a 28% improvement (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 23-34%) for face-to-face versus virtual PRIME.

1795,35448704,"Digital Storytelling Review in a Pharmacy Self-Care Course.  Digital storytelling is a type of active learning that allows instructors to simulate real-life situations through a series of connected videos. While this technique has been used in other healthcare education disciplines, its use in pharmacy has not been well documented. A digital storytelling model was incorporated in a required self-care pharmacy course to assess if the technique was helpful to improve the knowledge, confidence, and satisfaction of students. Due to a shift in online learning, the self-care course offered a remote exam review session containing a digital storytelling model, and this approach was compared to an in-person exam review that followed a lecture-based model held earlier in the course. Pre- and post-knowledge assessments were given to determine the impact of the digital storytelling review. There were 50 students involved in both sessions and there was a 70% response rate in the digital storytelling group and a 90% response rate in the lecture-based group. Students' knowledge numerically improved, but not to a statistically significant level for most questions. Nonetheless, students reported more confidence (p &lt; 0.05) in their ability to pass the upcoming exam following the digital storytelling review. Thematic analysis revealed that the digital storytelling session was engaging and interactive, though time-management and breakout rooms could be further optimized. Based on these results, exam review in a required self-care pharmacy course using a digital storytelling format may be a suitable method for students to apply course content and may particularly be of utility in online or hybrid courses.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant disruption in students' lives through lockdowns, restricted movement, remote instruction, and mixed information. Therefore, this study aimed to capture the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of student pharmacists during 2020-2021. A 43-item COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (COVKAP) survey previously developed was administered at four schools of pharmacy across the U.S. during Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. A total of 418 responses were analyzed from graduating classes of 2021-2024. There were no significant differences in correct COVID-19 knowledge responses across the four graduating years. Respondents' attitudes around COVID-19 were homogenous with the exception for their belief in their preparedness to administer COVID-19 vaccines. Respondents reported wearing masks daily (76.8%), infrequently visiting restaurants (82.1%), practicing social distancing daily (45.7%), and referring to medical journals for information (72%). In conclusion, during the pandemic, student pharmacists experienced significant changes in their academic lives. Their knowledge and subsequent attitudes and practices were consistent with the state of evidence during Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.

1797,35449350,"Development of the manchester framework for the evaluation of emergency department pharmacy services. BACKGROUND Many countries, including the United Kingdom, have established Emergency Department (ED) pharmacy services where some ED pharmacists now work as practitioners. They provide both traditional pharmaceutical care and novel practitioner care i.e. clinical examination, yet their impact on quality of care is unknown. AIM To develop a framework of structures, processes and potential outcome indicators to support evaluation of the quality of ED pharmacy services in future studies. METHOD Framework components (structures, processes and potential outcome indicators) were identified in three ways: from a narrative review of relevant international literature, and separate panel meetings with ED pharmacists and then other ED healthcare professionals. Structures and processes were collated into categories developed iteratively throughout data collection, with outcome indicators collated into six domains of quality as proposed by the Institute of Medicine. These raw data were then processed e.g. outcome indicators screened for clarity i.e. those which explicitly stated what would be measured were included in the framework. RESULTS A total of 190 structures, 533 processes, and 503 outcome indicators were identified. Through data processing a total of 153 outcome indicators were included in the final framework divided into the domains safe (32), effective (50), patient centred (18), timely (24), efficient (20) and equitable (9). CONCLUSIONS The first framework specific to the quality evaluation ED pharmacy services, service evaluators should validate potential outcome indicators prior to their use.

BACKGROUND The potentially inappropriate use of the proton pump inhibitors is prevalent in older adults. AIM To evaluate the impact of a clinical pharmacist-led stewardship program for the appropriate use of acid suppression therapy in older hospitalized patients. METHOD This parallel nonrandomized controlled study was conducted at an internal medicine service of a tertiary training and research hospital between September 2019 and August 2021. Older patients (≥ 65 years old and received proton pump inhibitors within 48 h of admission) were allocated to two groups according to their number of medical file records, whether odd or even, two groups: control and clinical pharmacist-led stewardship program for the appropriate use of acid suppression therapy (including medication reconciliation and medication review) during the hospital stay. Primary outcome measures were the rate of appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors during hospitalization and potentially inappropriate proton pump inhibitor use at discharge. RESULTS The rate of appropriate proton pump inhibitor use during hospitalization was significantly higher in the clinical pharmacist-led program (n = 100) than in the control group (n = 97) (46.4% vs. 79.0%; P < 0.001). The rate of potentially inappropriate proton pump inhibitor use at discharge was significantly lower (61.7% vs. 35.1%; P < 0.05) in the clinical pharmacist-led program among the older patients discharged with a proton pump inhibitor prescription. CONCLUSIONS A clinical pharmacist-led stewardship program for the appropriate use of acid suppression therapy improved the rate of appropriate proton pump inhibitor use and reduced the potentially inappropriate proton pump inhibitor use during the hospital stay.

The dataset presents the raw data collected through an online survey of senior high school students and their parents from 24 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions (96 cities) of China. We conducted the online survey using electronic self-administered questionnaires designed as student-version and parent-version during 26th February and 4th March of 2020. The questionnaire was designed using the online survey tool Sojump (Shanghai Information Co.), and released through WeChat platform (Tencent Corp) following principals-head teachers-students/parents approach. All the students and the parents were asked to answer the questions voluntarily and anonymously after reading informed consent at the forepage of the questionnaires. The information collected from students included: 1) demographic characteristics, including sex, date of birth, name of high school, academic year, and self-evaluated performance level; 2) education levels and occupations of parents; 3) degree preferences, including the willingness to learn medicine (prior and post COVID-19 outbreak), preferred medical career (clinician, public health practitioner, pharmacist, nurse or others), and main motivations for selecting or unselecting medical study; 4) infection of COVID-19 in acquaintances; 5) health literacy level on infectious diseases assessed using the Infectious Disease-specific Health Literacy Scale (IDSHL), and 6) anxiety level evaluated using the Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7). Information collected from parents included sex of their children and name of high school attended by their children, as well as their own educational level, occupation, anxiety symptoms, attitude toward their children's studying medicine, and main reasons for supportive or unsupportive attitudes, which were similar to the main motivations or de-motivations for medical study listed in the student-version questionnaire.

1806,35450833,"Pharmacy naloxone codispensing: A mixed methods study of practices and perspectives under a statewide standing order program. BACKGROUND In a previous statewide naloxone purchase trial conducted in Massachusetts, we documented high levels of naloxone accessibility, upon patient request, under the state's naloxone standing order (NSO) program. Equally important for reducing overdose mortality rates is expanding naloxone access via codispensing alongside opioid prescription and syringe purchases at pharmacies. OBJECTIVE To understand naloxone codispensing from the perspective of pharmacists under the Massachusetts NSO program. METHODS The study used a mixed methods design involving 3 focus groups and a quantitative survey. Participants in both the focus groups (N = 27) and survey (N = 339) were licensed Massachusetts pharmacists. Focus groups were conducted at 3 separate professional conferences for pharmacists. The survey was conducted using a stratified random sample of 400 chain and independent retail pharmacies across Massachusetts. All data were collected between September 2018 and November 2019. Quantitative and qualitative analyses examined current policies, practices, and attitudes regarding naloxone codispensing for patients at risk of opioid overdose. RESULTS Most pharmacists (69%) reported that they, their pharmacy, or both promoted codispensing alongside opioid prescriptions. A majority promoting naloxone codispensing did so for patients prescribed high opioid dosages (80%); fewer promoted codispensing for patients also prescribed benzodiazepines (20%). Facilitators to codispensing were pre-existing relationships between pharmacists and prescribers, mandatory pharmacist consultation, and universal naloxone promotion to all patients meeting certain criteria. Barriers to codispensing were pharmacists' concerns about offending patients by initiating a conversation about naloxone, insufficient technician training, workflow and resource constraints, and misconceptions surrounding naloxone. We found no substantive differences in outcomes between chain and independent pharmacies. CONCLUSION We documented several facilitators and barriers to naloxone codispensing in Massachusetts pharmacies. Areas amenable to intervention include increased training for front-line pharmacy technicians, mandatory pharmacist consultation for opioid-prescribed patients, workflow reorganization, and addressing stigma concerns on the pharmacist end.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND While various strategies for antibiotic restrictions have been validated, their impacts are not well described in smaller, non-teaching facilities. Fluoroquinolones are an appropriate target for restriction based on their propensity for overuse and potential for causing ""collateral damage."" AIM Evaluate the impact of a multifaceted approach to decreasing fluoroquinolone use on consumption of fluoroquinolones and alternative antibiotics at a smaller, non-teaching facility. METHOD Prospective, interrupted time series analysis conducted at a single 288-bed, non-teaching hospital with 71 adult ICU beds comparing antibiotic consumption measured monthly by defined daily doses per 1000 adjusted patient days (DDD/1000 APD) prior to intervention (January 2011 to August 2014) to short-term (October 2014 to December 2015) and long-term (January 2018 to December 2019) periods following intervention. RESULTS An increase in downward trends of fluoroquinolone use was observed from prior to intervention (-0.49 DDD/1000 APD) to the short-term period (-1.13 DDD/1000 APD) and to a greater extent in the long-term period following the intervention (-1.32 DDD/1000 APD). Fluoroquinolone consumption decreased from 100.20 DDD/1000 APD in August 2014 to 73.96 DDD/1000 APD in the short-term and 14.89 DDD/1000 APD in the long-term intervention period.

1809,35453723,"How Do Drugs Affect the Skeleton? Implications for Forensic Anthropology.  Forensic anthropologists rely on a number of parameters when analyzing human skeletal remains to assist in the identification of the deceased, predominantly age-at-death, sex, stature, ancestry or population affinity, and any unique identifying features. During the examination of human remains, it is important to be aware that the skeletal features considered when applying anthropological methods may be influenced and modified by a number of factors, and particular to this article, prescription drugs (including medical and non-medical use) and other commonly used drugs. In view of this, this paper aims to review the medical, clinical and pharmacological literature to enable an assessment of those drug groups that as side effects have the potential to have an adverse effect on the skeleton, and explore whether or not they can influence the estimation of age-at-death, sex and other indicators of the biological profile. Moreover, it may be that the observation of certain alterations or inconsistencies in the skeleton may relate to the use of drugs or medication, and this in turn may help narrow down the list of missing persons to which a set of human remains could belong. The information gathered from the clinical and medical literature has been extracted with a forensic anthropological perspective and provides an awareness on how several drugs, such as opioids, cocaine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol, tobacco and others have notable effects on bone. Through different mechanisms, drugs can alter bone mineral density, causing osteopenia, osteoporosis, increase the risk of fractures, osteonecrosis, and oral changes. Not much has been written on the influence of drugs on the skeleton from the forensic anthropological practitioner perspective; and this review, in spite of its limitations and the requirement of further research, aims to investigate the current knowledge of the possible effects of both prescription and recreational drugs on bones, contributing to providing a better awareness in forensic anthropological practice and assisting in the identification process of the deceased.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a key risk factor for ischaemic stroke. Following AF detection, treatment with oral anticoagulation can significantly lower mortality and morbidity rates associated with this risk. The availability of several hand-held devices which can detect AF may enable trained health professionals to adopt AF screening approaches which do not interfere with people's daily routines. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a hand-held device (the MyDiagnostick single-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor) in screening for AF when embedded into the handles of supermarket trolleys. METHODS A mixed methods two-phase approach will be taken. The quantitative first phase will involve the recruitment of 2000 participants from a convenience sample at four large supermarkets with pharmacies. Prospective participants will be asked to conduct their shopping using a trolley embedded with a MyDiagnostick sensor. If the device identifies a participant with AF, the in-store pharmacist will be dispatched to take a manual pulse measurement and a static control sensor reading and offer a cardiologist consultation referral. When the sensor does not detect AF, a researcher will confirm the reading with a manual pulse measurement. ECGs will be compiled, and the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values will be determined. A qualitative second phase will consist of semi-structured interviews carried out with those pharmacists and store managers in-store during the running of the trial period.

1812,35455796,"Nurse-Filled versus Pharmacy-Filled Medication Organization Devices-Survey on Current Practices and Views of Home Care Nursing Services.  Medication organization devices (MODs) are widely used among home care nursing services. However, current practices such as the responsibility for filling MODs, different MOD types used and requirements of home care nursing services are largely unknown. The study aimed at analyzing home care nursing services' current practices regarding MOD use, investigating their requirements and determining whether different practices met these requirements. A survey was administered online to German home care nursing services in February 2021. The importance of requirements and the extent of satisfaction were measured using a five-point scale. Attitudes towards disposable, pharmacy-filled MODs were recorded as free text. In total, 690 nursing services responded (67.5% privately owned and 34.5% based in large cities), 92.2% filled MODs themselves and used predominantly reusable, rigid MODs. Pharmacies filling MODs used primarily disposable MODs. Satisfaction with current practices was generally high. Respondents filling MODs themselves were more satisfied with nurses' medication knowledge, but less satisfied with cost effectiveness than those who had pharmacies fill MODs. Of all respondents filling MODs themselves who expressed an opinion on disposable, pharmacy-filled MODs, 50.9% were skeptical, primarily due to fear of losing flexibility. However, no difference in satisfaction with flexibility was found between respondents filling MODs themselves and those using pharmacy-filled MODs. In conclusion, employment of MODs in the professional care setting is a complex task with nursing services as key constituents. There is potential for improvement in the inter-professional collaboration between pharmacies and home care nursing services on the use of MODs. Measures for improvement have to address home care nursing services' requirements with respect to flexibility and medication knowledge.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The medication review process (MRP) is an extended, vital role of community pharmacists in improving health outcomes of medication use, yet it is neither systematically nor comprehensively provided bycommunity pharmacies in Jordan. This study aimed to identify the potential barriers hinderingMRP implementation bycommunity pharmacists in Jordan. A total of 550 community pharmacists electronically received a previously constructed and validated Arabic questionnaire explicitly developed to assess the current medication review practices and factors hindering the MRP, of whom 417 answered the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 75.8%. Among the investigated six categories' seventeen barriers tothe implementation of the MRP, the highest rating was found for remuneration barriers (55.8%), followed by barriers related to regulations and patients, which scored 52.3% and 48.8%, respectively. Resource-related barriers were recognizedby 44.6% of participants, while qualifications and barriers related to physicians scored 42.9% and 41.8%, respectively. Although community pharmacists in Jordan are eager to extend their roles from traditional to more patient-centered ones, they encounter various barriers hinderingsuch development. Regulation adjustments accompanied by cost-effective remuneration and proper training are strong facilitators for community pharmacists to initiate the medication review service; make available the needed resources; and invest efforts, time, and money to operate it.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

In order for future professionals to have these entry-level skills, students from different disciplines must work together in scenarios simulating patient care. This paper provides an overview of a large-scale, acute care simulation involving students of different disciplines, including nursing and pharmacy. A survey using the validated Student Perceptions of Interprofessional Clinical Education Revised (SPICE-R2) tool was administered to students participating in the simulation prior to and within 1 week of the simulation. There were between-group statistically significant differences on two items on the pre-simulation survey and two items on the post-simulation survey. Student participants reported more positive perceptions after the simulation on every item except for ""During their education, health professional students should be involved in teamwork with students from other health professions to understand their perspective roles"".

1816,35455900,"Budget Impact Analysis of Pharmacist-Led Medication Management in Cardiovascular and Type 2 Diabetic Patients.  The paper aims to identify and measure the costs and savings associated with the delivery of Comprehensive Medication Management (CMM) services in Croatia in patients diagnosed with hypertension accompanied by at least one additional established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) who use five or more medicines daily. The budget impact analysis (BIA) employed in this study compares the total costs of CMM to the cost reductions expected from CMM. The cost reductions (or savings) are based on the reduced incidence of unwanted clinical events and healthcare service utilisation rates due to CMM. The BIA model is populated by data on medication therapy costs, labour, and training from the pilot CMM intervention introduced in Zagreb's main Health Centre, while relevant international published sources were used to estimate the utilisation, incidence, and unwanted clinical events rates. Total direct costs, including pharmacists' labour and training (EUR 2,667,098) and the increase in the cost of prescribed medication (EUR 5,182,864) amounted to EUR 7,849,962 for 3 years, rendering the cost per treated patient per year EUR 57. CMM is expected to reduce the utilisation rates of healthcare services and the incidence of unwanted clinical events, leading to a total 3-year reduction in healthcare costs of EUR 7,787,765. Given the total CMM costs of EUR 7,849,962, CMM's 3-year budget impact equals EUR 92,869, rendering per treated patient an incremental cost of CMM EUR 0.67. Hence, CMM appears to be an affordable intervention for addressing medication mismanagement and irrational drug use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Children are at high risk of drug-related problems, increased risk of treatment failures, and high treatment costs. We aimed to evaluate the effect of pharmacist-led interventions on physicians' prescribing for pediatric outpatients. METHODS A prospective study with pre- and post-intervention measurement assessment was conducted to collect pediatric outpatients' prescriptions during the pre-intervention period (January 2020) and post-intervention (August 2020) at a children's hospital in Vietnam. Drug-related problems were identified and categorized according to Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE), version 9.1. The intervention program was developed based on the results of pre-intervention observations. After the intervention, prescriptions were evaluated. Statistical tests were used to compare the proportions of drug-related problems before and after the intervention and to identify factors related to drug-related problems. RESULTS There were 2788 out of 4218 (66.1%) prescriptions with at least one drug-related problem before the intervention. Of these drug-related problems, the most common was inappropriate timing of administration and incorrect dosage (36.1% and 35.6%, respectively). After the intervention, the percentage of prescriptions with at least one drug-related problem was 45.5% (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the drug-related problem types decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). The binary logistic regression analysis results showed that in addition to pharmacists' intervention, patients' gender, primary disease, comorbidity status, and the total number of drugs prescribed were also factors related to drug-related problems.

1818,35456163,"Assessing the Impact of an Advanced Clinical Decision Support System on Medication Safety and Hospital Readmissions in an Innovative Transitional Care Model: A Pilot Study.  (1) Background: Adverse drug events and inappropriate use of medications lead to hospitalizations, medication-related morbidity, and mortality. This study examined whether a novel medication risk prediction tool, the MedWise Risk Score™, was associated with medication safety-related problem (MRP) identification and whether integration into an existing innovative transitions of care (TOC) service could decrease readmissions. (2) Methods: This retrospective comparator group study assessed patients discharged from a hospital in southern Arizona between January and December 2020. Participants were included in the study if they were 18 years of age or older, referred to the pharmacist for TOC services, and received a pharmacist consultation within one-week post discharge. Patients were categorized into two groups: (1) medication safety review (MSR)-TOC service (intervention) or (2) existing innovative TOC service (control). (3) Results: Of 164 participants, most were male (57%) and were between 70-79 years of age. Overall, there were significantly more drug-drug interactions (DDI) MRPs identified per patient in the intervention vs. control group for those who were readmitted (3.7 ± 1.5 vs. 0.9 ± 0.6, p &lt; 0.001) and those who were not readmitted (2 ± 1.3 vs. 1.3 ± 1.2, p = 0.0120). Furthermore, of those who were readmitted, the average number of identified MRPs per patient was greater in the intervention group compared to the control (6.3 vs. 2.5, respectively, p &gt; 0.05). Relative to the control, the readmission frequency was 30% lower in the treatment group; however, there was insufficient power to detect significant differences between groups.

The unique professional competence of pharmacists can support the safe and effective use of medicines by patients. Additionally, it is important to acknowledge and incorporate the needs of patients with various cultural and social backgrounds. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the experiences and expectations of Russian- and Estonian-speaking pharmacy customers about medicines-related services in Estonian community pharmacies. Cross-sectional study among pharmacy customers was conducted in Estonia 2018-2020. For data analysis, an Independent t-Test was used to compare experiences and expectations of respondents towards medicines-related services. The study involved 552 pharmacy customers: 58.5% (n = 323) Estonians and 41.5% (n = 229) Russians. The majority of the total sample (78.3%) considered the pharmacist competent to help. Medicines-related concerns were more common among Russians (p = 0.037), however, they sought less contact to consult a pharmacist than Estonians (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, expectations about different medicines-related services in the future were higher among Estonians than among Russians (p &lt; 0.001).

AIM(S) The aim of the study was to explore perspectives of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder and their healthcare providers on medication self-management. METHODS In a qualitative descriptive design, semi-structured interviews were used. Forty-nine interviews were completed (nurses n = 18; psychiatrists n = 3; hospital pharmacists n = 2; patients n = 26). Data analysis was iterative using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS From the thematic analysis of the interviews, three main themes emerged: monitoring and shared decision-making, relationship based on trust, and patient satisfaction and rehabilitation; as well as three sub-themes: available tools, patient readiness, and safety. Regular monitoring and follow-ups were considered conditions for medication self-management. All stakeholders considered that the patient, the nursing staff, and the psychiatrist should all be involved in the process of medication self-management. All healthcare providers emphasized the importance of regular re-evaluations of the patient and were worried about medication errors and misuse. Most patients considered medication self-management during hospitalisation to increase their confidence, self-reliance, and satisfaction. Many participants thought it would make a positive contribution to the recovery process. DISCUSSION All stakeholders were positive towards medication self-management under specific conditions. According to the participants, medication self-management offered many benefits, including the implementation of more structure for the patient, an ameliorated preparatory phase towards discharge, and an actual improvement of future adherence. All participants considered medication self-management to contribute to more profound medication knowledge and an overall improvement of their health literacy.

Short gut syndrome can lead to type 3 intestinal failure, and nutrition and hydration can only be achieved with parenteral nutrition (PN). While this is a lifesaving intervention, it carries short- and long-term complications leading to complex comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease. Through a patient with devastating inflammatory bowel disease's journey, this review article illustrates the effect of short gut and PN on kidney function, focusing on secondary hyperoxaluria and acute precipitants of glomerular filtration. In extensive small bowel resections colon in continuity promotes fluid reabsorption and hydration but predisposes to hyperoxaluria and stone disease through the impaired gut permeability and fat absorption. It is fundamental, therefore, for dietary intervention to maintain nutrition and prevent clinical deterioration (i.e., sarcopenia) but also to limit the progression of renal stone disease. Adaptation of both enteral and parenteral nutrition needs to be individualised, keeping in consideration not only patient comorbidities (short gut and jejunostomy, cirrhosis secondary to PN) but also patients' wishes and lifestyle. A balanced multidisciplinary team (renal physician, gastroenterologist, dietician, clinical biochemist, pharmacist, etc.) plays a core role in managing complex patients, such as the one described in this review, to improve care and overall outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1824,35459405,"A Review of Push-Dose Vasopressors in the Peri-operative and Critical Care Setting.  During hospitalization, the risk of hypotension and associated sequelae remain important considerations for patient outcomes. The use of push-dose vasopressors (PDP) outside of the operating room has increased in recent years to combat the negative effects of hypotension. This narrative review evaluates the utility of PDP in its traditional perioperative setting as well as in areas of increasing use such as the emergency department and intensive care unit. Articles evaluating PDP highlight successful increases in blood pressure with all agents but differ in rates of adverse events and most lack direct comparison of PDP agents in regard to safety and efficacy. Agents utilized as PDP, including epinephrine, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and ephedrine vary in mechanism of action, onset of action, and duration of action. These variations in pharmacology along with published literature may lead to differences in the preferred PDP for various clinical scenarios. Many adverse events associated with PDP have been due to dosing errors highlighting the importance of education surrounding the use of these agents. Additional research is necessary to further elucidate the risks and benefits of PDP in clinical practice, and to determine which PDP is truly preferred. Careful consideration should be given when determining the appropriateness of this administration method of vasopressors in various clinical scenarios.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

A granulation method using a planetary centrifugal mixer, called planetary centrifugal granulation, has been developed for small-scale production, such as extemporaneous preparation in pharmacies. Although the impact of its operational parameters on granulation is described, the scale effect has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the effects of vessel size and vessel filling rate on granule properties. In this study, ibuprofen 20% granules consisting of lactose, cornstarch, sodium carmellose, and talc were used as model granules. Granulation was performed using geometrically similar containers, 6-58 mL, with a filling rate of 20-70%. After granulation, we monitored the granule properties, for example, median diameter (d50), span of particle size distribution, and sphericity. At filling rates of 40% and 50% in the 58-mL vessel, the granules grew larger in diameter, and at a rate of 30%, the granules showed a higher sphericity. When the filling rate was 30%, d50 became larger and the span decreased as the vessel size increased. The yields of the granules were higher than 95% when using the 12-58 mL vessel. Lastly, the drug content uniformity and drug dissolution behavior of the granules produced in different vessel size were examined. The granules showed similar drug consistencies and drug dissolution profiles. In conclusion, the quality of the products was not affected by changes in vessel size. Thus, pharmacists could prepare and compound the granule formulations with high yield and appropriate quality using an adequate vessel in the same manner.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1830,35461289,"Increasing uptake to a lung cancer screening programme: building with communities through co-design. BACKGROUND Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the UK. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has been shown to identify lung cancer at an earlier stage. A risk stratified approach to LDCT referral is recommended. Those at higher risk of developing lung cancer (aged 55 + , smoker, deprived area) are least likely to participate in such a programme and, therefore, it is necessary to understand the barriers they face and to develop pathways for implementation in order to increase uptake. METHODS A 2-phased co-design process was employed to identify ways to further increase opportunity for uptake of a lung cancer screening programme, using a risk indicator for LDCT referral, amongst people who could benefit most. Participants were members of the public at high risk from developing lung cancer and professionals who may provide or signpost to a future lung cancer screening programme. Phase 1: interviews and focus groups, considering barriers, facilitators and pathways for provision. Phase 2: interactive offline booklet and online surveys with professionals. Qualitative data was analysed thematically, while descriptive statistics were conducted for quantitative data. RESULTS In total, ten barriers and eight facilitators to uptake of a lung cancer screening programme using a biomarker blood test for LDCT referral were identified. An additional four barriers and four facilitators to provision of such a programme were identified. These covered wider themes of acceptability, awareness, reminders and endorsement, convenience and accessibility. Various pathway options were evidenced, with choice being a key facilitator for uptake. There was a preference (19/23) for the provision of home test kits but 7 of the 19 would like an option for assistance, e.g. nurse, pharmacist or friend. TV was the preferred means of communicating about the programme and fear was the most dominant barrier perceived by members of the public. CONCLUSION Co-design has provided a fuller understanding of the barriers, facilitators and pathways for the provision of a future lung cancer screening programme, with a focus on the potential of biomarker blood tests for the identification of at-risk individuals. It has also identified possible solutions and future developments to enhance uptake, e.g. Embedding the service in communities, Effective communication, Overcoming barriers with options. Continuing the process to develop these solutions in a collaborative way helps to encourage the personalised approach to delivery that is likely to improve uptake amongst groups that could benefit most.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Previous large-scale vaccination clinics have been successful before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, owing to the strict storage requirements and pharmaceutical preparation needed for the COVID-19 vaccines, careful thought and planning were necessary to successfully deploy these clinics immediately after vaccine availability. The focus of this manuscript is to describe the development and implementation of COVID-19 vaccination clinics in a large public university, using professionals from within and outside of its health sciences schools. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this project was to (1) implement COVID-19 vaccination clinics for university faculty, staff, students, and community members. Additional objectives of the clinics were to (2) actively incorporate pharmacy, nursing, and medical students into the clinic workflow; (3) promote interprofessional collaboration among faculty and students; and (4) assess patient satisfaction. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION The School of Pharmacy faculty, in conjunction with the Office of Strategic Initiatives, planned and coordinated COVID-19 vaccination clinics from December 2020 to July 2021. Students and faculty from schools of pharmacy, nursing, and medicine were used. COVID-19 vaccinations were offered to university faculty, staff, and students and community members based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention priority groups. The clinic processes were designed such that they could be scaled from 100 to 2,000 participants per day. PRACTICE INNOVATION The School of Pharmacy led approach was adjustable depending on the number of patients, continuously monitored and adaptable. The importance of pharmacists as part of the interprofessional health care team was exemplified by faculty and students involved. EVALUATION METHODS All patients receiving COVID-19 vaccinations at the clinics were e-mailed anonymous surveys for assessment of the quality of the vaccination encounter after completion of their primary vaccine series. RESULTS More than 15,000 COVID-19 vaccinations were provided through the clinics from December 2020 to July 2021. Professional staffing totaled 3352 hours for the 48 clinics. Thirty-eight percent of the vaccinated patients responded to the clinic satisfaction survey with predominately excellent ratings. CONCLUSION COVID-19 vaccination clinics can be successfully planned and implemented in a scalable fashion in a large university setting using an interprofessional team approach.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1832,35462033,"Health System-Level Performance in Prescribing Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy for Patients with HFrEF: Results from the CONNECT-HF Trial. BACKGROUND Health system-level interventions to improve use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) often fail in the acute care setting. We sought to identify factors associated with high performance in adoption of GDMT among health systems in CONNECT-HF. METHODS AND RESULTS Site-level composite quality scores were calculated at discharge and last follow-up. Site performance was defined as the average change in score from baseline to last follow-up and analyzed by performance tertile using a mixed-effects model with baseline performance as a fixed effect and site as a random effect. Among 150 randomized sites, mean 12-month improvement in GDMT was 1.8% (-26.4% to 60.0%). Achievement of ≥50% target dose for angiotensin-converting enzymes/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and beta blockers at 12 months was modest, even at the highest performing sites (median 29.6% [23%, 41%] and 41.2% [29%, 50%]). Sites achieving higher GDMT scores had care teams that included social workers and pharmacists and patients able to afford medications and access medication lists in the electronic health record. CONCLUSIONS Substantial gaps in site-level use of GDMT were found even among highest performing sites. Failure of hospital-level interventions to improve quality metrics suggests that a team-based approach to care and improved patient access to medications are needed for post-discharge success.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Health disparity is defined as a type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic and/or environmental disadvantage. Over the past two decades, major efforts have been undertaken to mitigate health disparities and promote health equity in the United States. Within pharmacy practice, health disparities have also been identified to play a role in influencing pharmacists' practice across various clinical settings. However, well-characterized solutions to address such disparities, particularly within pharmacy practice, are lacking in the literature. Recognizing that a significant amount of work will be necessary to reduce or eliminate health disparities, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences held a webinar in June 2021 to explore pertinent issues related to this topic.

Objective To report the effectiveness of the antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in a long-term care (LTC) facility, by analyzing the change in antimicrobial consumption and cost and multidrug resistance (MDR) rates over a 5-year period. Method A prospective interventional study was conducted at a 106-bed facility (nursing home: 100 beds and an intensive care unit (ICU): 6 beds). The ASP was designed and led by a multidisciplinary team including an infectious disease consultant, two clinical pharmacists, a clinical microbiologist, and an infection control preventionist. Five key performance indicators were monitored: (1) intravenous (IV)-to-oral switch rate, (2) consumption of restricted IV antimicrobials (raw consumption and defined daily doses (DDD) index), (3) cost of restricted IV antimicrobials, (4) antimicrobial sensitivity profiles, and (5) MDR rate among hospital-acquired infections (MDR-HAI). Result A ∼5.5-fold enhancement of the IV-to-oral switch and a 40% reduction in the overall consumption of restricted IV antimicrobials were observed. Regarding the cost, the cumulative cost saving was estimated as 5.64 million SAR (US$1.50 million). Microbiologically, no significant change in antimicrobial sensitivity profiles was observed; however, a large-size reduction in the MDR-HAI rate was observed, notably in ICU where it declined from 3.22 per 1,000 patient days, in 2015, to 1.14 per 1,000 patient days in 2020. Interestingly, the yearly overall MDR rate was strongly correlated with the level of antimicrobial consumption.

1835,35464499,"Awareness and Views of Pharmacists and Physicians Toward Prescribing of Drugs for Off-Label Use in the Pediatric Population in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND Prescribing off-label drugs in healthcare settings is a common practice worldwide. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate the knowledge and views of healthcare professionals regarding the off-label use of drugs in pediatric patients. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to December, 2020, among physicians and pharmacists in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A 28-item questionnaire was distributed to the healthcare professionals through an electronic link. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to report the data. RESULTS A total of 368 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. More than two-thirds of the respondents were aware of the correct definition of off-label drugs. Of the respondents, 37% were satisfied with their knowledge related to the use of off-label drugs in the pediatric population. Approximately half of the healthcare professionals in the study had major concerns about the efficacy and safety of off-label prescribing to children. CONCLUSION Off-label drug use among pediatric patients is common practice in the KSA and healthcare professionals providing treatment to the children are also aware of the concept of off-label drugs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1836,35464638,"Pharmacists' experiences of consumer stockpiling: insights from COVID-19. Background Consumer stockpiling from pharmacies has been reported by media outlets throughout the course of COVID-19. Aim This study evaluated pharmacists' perceptions of consumer stockpiling from pharmacies, the impact of stockpiling, aggressive or hostile behaviour from customers and preparedness for COVID-19 and future pandemics. Method A self-administered survey was disseminated between September and November of 2020. The survey comprised four major sections: demographic information, experiences of consumer stockpiling, impact of consumer stockpiling and preparedness for COVID-19 and future pandemics. Survey results were analysed in Microsoft Excel using descriptive statistics. Results Of the 56 responses analysed, most pharmacists observed consumer stockpiling of over-the-counter products (98.2%), schedule 2 and schedule 3 medications (92.8%) and prescription only medications (94.6%). The most commonly stockpiled items included face masks, hand-sanitisers and wipes, alcohol wipes and antiseptic solutions, thermometers, paracetamol and salbutamol inhalers. Patients also requested the dispensing of several months' supply of regular prescription medications. Customer aggression was observed by 53.6% of pharmacists, with 63% of pharmacists agreeing that hostile behaviour impeded their practice. Only 36.7% of pharmacists felt adequately prepared to cope with the challenges of COVID-19. Conclusion Consumer stockpiling from pharmacies was observed throughout COVID-19. Stockpiling as well as aggressive and hostile behaviour from customers affected pharmacists, their staff, business and other pharmacy customers. Additional studies are needed to investigate the severity of these issues and to inform policy changes to help mitigate consumer stockpiling and prepare the pharmacy profession for future pandemics.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1837,35464639,"Public hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccine and the role of pharmacists in addressing the problem and improving uptake.  COVID-19 is one of the worst pandemics in recent human history, causing huge health, economic, and psychosocial damage. Since the pandemic hit, several unsubstantiated claims regarding exposure, transmission and management have been disseminated. Misinformation and associated public confusion now extend to the COVID-19 vaccines, spanning from claims based on possible links between some vaccine types and rare blood clots, to baseless claims. As a result, the public's trust in COVID-19 vaccines has been eroded, fuelling an already troubling trend of vaccine hesitancy. As medication experts and the most accessible healthcare providers, pharmacists are well equipped with the required skills and knowledge to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake by taking roles that range from dispelling myths, to providing reliable evidence-based information, through to vaccine administration. This paper discusses public hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccines, major contributing factors, and the role pharmacists can play in reducing hesitancy and increasing vaccine uptake.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1838,35464784,"Interinstitutional simulation of patients with COVID-19 during a remote acute-care advanced pharmacy practice experience. Introduction Faculty and staff from Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh Schools of Pharmacy created a simulation activity focused on the care of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Students on remote, short-term-care advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) rotations from both universities worked in comingled teams and completed two educational electronic health record reviews, complex simulation sessions, and debriefs. Individually, students completed two educational electronic health record reviews and verbal patient presentations before and after the simulation sessions. Objectives Evaluate the effects of a simulation activity during a remote short-term-care APPE on student confidence and knowledge surrounding the care of a critically ill patient with COVID-19. Methods Student knowledge surrounding COVID-19 short-term-care treatment principles was assessed through pre-/postcase-based multiple-choice examinations and an intermittent clinical examination (ICE). Student confidence and perceptions were gathered through anonymous pre-/postsurveys. The written examination and patient presentation recordings were compared from baseline to the final assessment using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results In total, 92 students participated in the activity. There was a statistically significant improvement from baseline to the final assessment (preassessment median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 55.3% [50%-60.5%]; postassessment median [IQR]: 68.4 [60.5%-73.7%]; P < .001) on the written examination. ICE total scores improved from baseline (preassessment median [range]: 33 [28-36] vs postassessment median [range]: 36.5 [29.5-43.52]; P = .004) as well as the objective (P < .001), plan (P < .001), and monitoring (P < .001) subdomain scores. Student confidence reported on surveys improved from baseline in all domains. Conclusion Remote simulation sessions improve student knowledge and confidence and provide an opportunity for students to experience caring for patients with COVID-19 in a safe environment. Collaboration between schools of pharmacy can be successfully employed to leverage resources and expertise to expand opportunities for students.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1839,35465635,"Drug-related problems identified during pharmaceutical care interventions in an intensive care unit at a tertiary university hospital. Introduction Drug-related problems could potentially worsen the clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. Critically ill patients are generally considered more vulnerable to harm from drug-related problems due to frequent medication-related events and complicated clinical courses. However, drug-related problems identified by on-ward clinical pharmacists in medical intensive care units in Thailand are not well reported. This study reports clinically relevant data with the description of identified problems, common causes of drug-related problems, and pharmacists' interventions performed in real world, so that it may serve as an educational material for pharmacists who implement a pharmaceutical care and participate in medical intensive care units. Methods A retrospective descriptive study was conducted at a tertiary university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, from January 2015 to December 2020. The drug-related problems were categorized according to Cipolle et al.'s classification. The severity of drug-related problems in this study was rated by modifying the definition of The National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Taxonomy of Medication Error to report harm from drug-related problem-related patient outcomes. Results A total of 698 drug-related problems were detected in 374 critically ill patients. The prevalence of drug-related problems occurring in critically ill patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit was 73.9%. The most frequent drug-related problems were dosage too high (27.7%), ineffective drug (17.2%), need for additional drug therapy (15.3%), unnecessary drug therapy (14.6%), dosage too low (14.3%), adverse drug reaction (9.7%), and non-adherence (1.2%). The severity of drug-related problems in the medical intensive care unit was assessed as a drug-related problem with no harm (78.2%). Pharmacists' interventions were advised according to drug-related problem identification to provide personalized pharmacotherapy optimization in critically ill patients. Conclusion The most frequent drug-related problem identified during pharmaceutical care interventions in the medical intensive care unit at tertiary university hospital is dosage too high. The severity of drug-related problems is mostly determined as drug-related problems with no harm.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1840,35465688,"Barriers to COVID-19 Vaccines and Strategies to Improve Acceptability and Uptake.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on communities across the United States (US). Three vaccines have now been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for use in the US. However, barriers to vaccination exist, some of which are well documented in the literature, including lack of knowledge, fear, accessibility, mistrust in the healthcare system, and systemic and operational obstacles. Vaccine hesitancy in the US could potentially hinder all the efforts and resources being used to beat COVID-19, which has resulted in more than 594 000 deaths in the US per the CDC as of early June 2021.

1841,35465767,"Clinical Pharmacist Led Medication Reconciliation Program in an Emergency Department Observation Unit. OBJECTIVES Medication reconciliation is the process of comparing a patient's hospital medication orders to all of the medications that the patient has been taking prior to admission. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation in reducing ED visit rates. The secondary aim of this study was to evaluate if a clinical pharmacist reduces medication errors in an ED observation unit (OBS). METHODS This was a retrospective, IRB approved, chart review conducted at New York University Langone Health-Tisch Hospital. The study defines the year before a clinical pharmacist was present on the unit (July 5, 2016 through July 4, 2017) as the control group and the first year a clinical pharmacist was present on the unit (July 5, 2017 through July 4, 2018) as the intervention group. The primary endpoint was 30-day ED re-visits. The secondary endpoints were 60-and 90-day ED re-visits, number, type and severity of medication history and reconciliation discrepancies. RESULTS The primary endpoint of 30-day ED visits occurred in 153 patients in the no pharmacist group and 88 patients in the OBS clinical pharmacist group (19.1% vs 9.9%, P < .00001). The secondary endpoint of 60- day ED visits occurred in 53 patients in the no pharmacist group and 39 patients in the OBS clinical pharmacist group (8.2% vs 4.9%, P = .01). The secondary endpoint of 90- day ED visits occurred in 31 patients in the no pharmacist group and 26 patients in the OBS clinical pharmacist group (5.2% vs 3.4%, P = .01).

1842,35466066,"Exploring the moderating role of job resources in how job demands influence burnout and professional fulfillment among U.S. pharmacists. BACKGROUND Job stress, burnout, and fulfillment can be modeled using the Job Demands and Resources model (JD-R). OBJECTIVE This study explores the relationship between job demands and burnout and professional fulfillment in pharmacists, and the moderating role of job resources. METHODS Data were obtained from the 2019 National Pharmacist Workforce Survey of a random sample of U.S. licensed pharmacists. The survey assessed pharmacist demographics (age, gender, and work setting), job demands (workload and work-home conflict), job resources (job control, time spent in various work activities, and social support), as well as burnout and professional fulfillment. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between job demands-resources variables and pharmacists' professional fulfillment and burnout. Moderation was assessed by including interaction terms (job demands x job resources) in the regression models. The change in marginal mean burnout and professional fulfillment for different combinations of job demands and job resources was used to assess the salience of significant moderation effects. RESULTS Women and community pharmacists accounted for 64.8% and 45.8% of the study sample, respectively. Age was negatively associated with burnout. Job demands were positively associated with burnout and negatively associated with professional fulfillment, and the converse was true for job resources. Significant moderation effects were observed for 7 out of 12 interaction terms assessed. The moderating effect of job resources was more salient under varying conditions of job demands in 5 out of 7 instances where significant interaction effects were observed. CONCLUSION While pharmacist characteristics explained a significant amount of variation in burnout and professional fulfillment, also considering the moderating effects of job resources on the association of job demands with burnout and professional fulfillment identified additional information, such as the increased importance of job control and task variety in high workload environments.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1843,35466072,"Defining key pharmacist and technician roles in response to a hospital downtime or cyberattack.  The occurrence of ransomware, or ""cyberattacks,"" on hospital institutions has steadily increased in recent years. Pharmacy departments that rely on automation and software applications are greatly affected when those systems are offline. Pharmacy workflow without automation can be manually intensive and unsafe for patients. More challenges may be present if the hospital pharmacy is not prepared for a cyberattack or does not have standardized downtime procedures for such an event. This article describes a specific event that took place at a 350-bed acute care hospital located in the United States during the summer of 2021. The hospital lost access to the electronic health record, admitting and registration system, financial systems, pharmacy information systems, barcode medication administration systems, server for the automated dispensing cabinets or inventory management applications, diversion software, compliance applications, and all clinical decision support tools. The goal is to describe a standardized downtime procedure for medication management by identifying specific pharmacist and technician roles when automated processes are offline.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1844,35466351,"Prospective Validation of Sedation Scale Scores That Identify Light Sedation: A Pilot Study. BACKGROUND Intensive care unit (ICU) sedation guidelines recommend targeting a light sedation level, but light sedation has no accepted definition, and inconsistent levels have been proposed. OBJECTIVE To determine Sedation-Agitation Scale and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores that best describe patients' ability to follow voice commands. METHODS This prospective, observational pilot study enrolled a convenience sample of ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Pairs of trained investigators evaluated scores on the Sedation-Agitation Scale and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and ability to follow commands before and up to 2 hours after sedation lightening in a blind, independent, simultaneous fashion. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and likelihood ratios (LRs) of Sedation-Agitation Scale and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores associated with light sedation (ability to follow at least 3 commands) were calculated. RESULTS Ninety-six assessments (50 before and 46 after lightening of sedation) were performed in medical ICU patients. Scores best associated with ability to follow at least 3 commands were Sedation-Agitation Scale score of 4 (PPV, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70-0.98; LR, 14.0) and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score of -1 (PPV, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93; LR, 10.7), superior to previously recommended thresholds of Sedation-Agitation Scale score of 3 (PPV, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.75; LR, 3.1) and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score of -3 (PPV, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39-0.64; LR, 2.0).

BACKGROUND In 2017, the General Pharmaceutical Council (UK) issued new Standards for Pharmacy Professionals and supporting guidance, Guidance on Religion, Personal Values and Beliefs, to help pharmacists when their religion, personal values or beliefs might impact on their provision of services. OBJECTIVE To understand how pharmacists in the UK experience and perceive conflicts between their personal ethical commitments (matters of conscience) and professional obligations in guidance from their regulator. METHODS Twenty-four registered pharmacists were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. KEY FINDINGS Participants were generally aware of the Council's consultations and responded if they had something to say, or it was their role to respond. Age and stage, confidence, and workload impacted on whether participants responded to Council consultations, and, therefore, on the range of views heard. The professional obligation to provide person-centred care (PCC) was central to participants' practice, and personal ethical commitments were important to some. Conflicts between such commitments and professional obligations were rare, and it was generally believed that the former should be accommodated, as far as possible, but not imposed on others. Personal ethical commitments could affect PCC, and some suggested that the Council's Guidance was not clear on pharmacists' responsibilities in this regard. CONCLUSIONS Clarification on the role of personal ethical commitments in professional practice, particularly in relation to providing PCC, would be useful. Clearer guidance on how pharmacists should manage perceived conflicts between their personal ethical commitments and their professional obligations would also be welcomed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibiotic therapy represents one of the most common interventions in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). This study aims to describe current antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) in European PICUs. A cross-sectional survey distributed to European pediatric intensive care physicians through the European Society of Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care (ESPNIC) Infection, Inflammation, and Sepsis Section, to members of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Intensive Care, of the Pediatric Reanimation and Emergency Care French Group, and to European physicians known to be involved in antimicrobial stewardship programs. Responses from 60 PICUs across 12 countries were analyzed. Fifty three (88%) stated that ASP was implemented. The main interventions considered as ASP were the pharmacokinetic monitoring of antimicrobials (n = 41, 77%) and the development of facility-specific clinical practice guidelines (n = 40, 75%). The most common team composition of antimicrobial stewardship program included a pediatric infectious disease physician, a pharmacist, and a microbiologist (n = 11, 21%).

Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients treated with intravenous polymyxin B from August 2018 to August 2020 in a Chinese teaching hospital. Renal function was evaluated during therapy with polymyxin B and at the end of the treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for the nephrotoxicity of polymyxin B. Results A total of 321 patients were included, and the incidence of AKI was 26.2% and 25.1% during polymyxin B therapy and at the end of treatment, respectively. Independent risk factors for AKI during therapy with polymyxin B were septic shock, coadministration of vancomycin or loop diuretics, and advanced age (≥60 years), while the incidence of AKI during treatment with polymyxin B was considered to be an independent risk factor for AKI at the end of the treatment.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health threat for Malawi which is facing several challenges concurrently including disease burden; inadequate finances; illiteracy; and public mistrust in government. In this pandemic, vaccines are the most reliable and cost-effective public health intervention, and the Malawian government has instituted an action plan which includes prioritizing the vaccination of traditional and religious leaders, increased vaccination sites to include workplaces and shopping malls, and health promotion. However, there is still considerable hesitancy around the use of the available vaccines in Malawi. In this paper, we explore the multiple interrelated factors driving COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malawi. It is therefore recommended that the Malawian government embrace multicomponent and wide-ranging strategies to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the country.

BACKGROUND Older adults with uncontrolled hypertension can benefit from pharmacist-led interventions as they regularly access community pharmacies. However, several barriers to adherence interventions in a community pharmacy setting exist, and few studies have evaluated the feasibility of medication adherence monitoring within the community pharmacy workflow in the United States. OBJECTIVES To undertake a factorial survey to determine medication adherence monitoring attitudes of pharmacists and the factors that facilitate or impede adherence counseling by pharmacists within a U.S. community pharmacy setting for antihypertensives in older adults. METHODS The study was a Theory of Planned Behavior informed factorial survey of New York community pharmacists. The survey had (1) a factorial vignette, to determine how pharmacists make real-life decisions in response to complex situations; (2) questionnaires on medication monitoring attitudes, behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and perceived behavioral control regarding medication adherence monitoring, and (3) respondent and workplace characteristics. In response to vignettes, the adherence monitoring tasks were (1) examining patients dispensing records to assess adherence, (2) asking patients about their adherence behavior, and (3) exploring patient beliefs about their antihypertensives. RESULTS From the 350 completed responses, more than the vignette characteristics, it was the pharmacist characteristics that explained the major variance in the 3 medication monitoring tasks. The respondents demonstrated modestly positive attitudes to medication monitoring, were less positive about their external perception of medication monitoring, and reported difficulty to perform the medication monitoring tasks. In factorial vignette analysis, these attitudes and beliefs significantly impacted adherence monitoring tasks as did situational factors such as time pressures, medication beliefs of patients, the relationship developed with patients, and staffing in the pharmacy, and respondent factors such as pharmacy type and location. CONCLUSION Future community pharmacist-led adherence interventions should be designed to address pharmacist attitudes and beliefs and certain workplace characteristics to enable successful implementation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The desire and need for remote access to education dramatically increased during the coronavirus pandemic, and it is only a question of which changes will remain in the future. Programs have begun to review changes and approaches that should be continued. This commentary advocates that the use of lecture capture (LC) as an instructional delivery strategy, is no longer just a supplement to learning, but is now a standard of practice in health professions education. LC creates equity for students by providing additional opportunities to review material. Students may be balancing schoolwork with a job, care for their children, or paying for groceries. LC allows students to acquire information at lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy at a time that fits into their schedule, at a pace appropriate for them, and in a method that may better suit their learning needs.

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for institutional background information, curricular content, and barriers to inclusion. Chi-square test examined relationships between SR inclusion at public versus private programs. Fisher's exact test assessed associations between traditional and accelerated programs.Results. Fifty-eight COP/SOPs provided usable responses. Of the respondents, 84% indicated teaching of SR and its impact on health and healthcare as a low priority. For 24% of respondents, SR was not currently included in their curriculum, while 34% indicated that SR was included in one or more courses or modules but was not a focus. Despite SR being offered in any didactic year, it was rarely included in experiential curricula. Top barriers to inclusion were lack of faculty knowledge and comfort with content and limited curricular space. No significant differences were found between program types.Conclusion. Based on the current level of SR education and barriers to inclusion, faculty need training and resources to teach SR concepts within pharmacy curricula. The inclusion of SR concepts and guidance in APE standards could help to drive meaningful change and promote health equity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1863,35470747,"Community pharmacists' challenges regarding adverse drug reaction reporting: a cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE The effectiveness of the national drug safety monitoring program directly depends on the active participation of healthcare professionals in reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aim of the study was to explore community pharmacists' comprehension of pharmacovigilance, their perspectives toward reporting ADRs and investigate the current practice of ADR reporting among pharmacists in Serbia. METHODS This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of pharmacists in Serbia between November 2019 and March 2020 using a pre-tested questionnaire distributed online. Eligible participants were community pharmacists in Serbia who were willing to participate in the study during the data collection period. Non-parametric statistical tests were performed in the analysis of knowledge, perspectives and ADR reporting. The validity and reliability of the survey were measured by exploratory factor analysis. RESULTS The median knowledge score was 6 out of 10 (interquartile range 5-7, range 2-10). No significant differences in the knowledge scores of pharmacists were found based on weekly working hours (U = 24805, p = 0.374), working experience (χ2 = 4.011, DF =2, p = 0.135), being a member of a professional organization (U = 24312, p = 0.209), or highest level of pharmacy qualification obtained (χ2 = 3.233, DF =3, p = 0.506). Only 28.8% of pharmacists reported ADR at least once a year, while the majority of them have never reported any ADRs. CONCLUSIONS Despite the community pharmacists' positive attitude toward adverse drug reporting and their role in the process, they show limited knowledge regarding the issue and highly prevalent under-reporting of ADRs. Educational programs are necessary to increase ADRs reporting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1864,35471065,"Financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs among older adults in the United States before, during, and after the Medicare Part D ""Donut Hole"": Findings from 1998, 2001, 2015, and 2021.  BACKGROUND: Cost-related nonadherence compromises successful and effective management of chronic disease. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) aimed to increase the affordability of outpatient prescription drugs for older adults (older than age 64 years). The Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage gap (""donut hole"") created by the MMA was fully closed in 2020 by the ACA. OBJECTIVES: To (1) describe prescription drug coverage and financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs among older American adults for 2021, (2) compare these results with findings from data collected before the MMA and during the progressive elimination of the Medicare Part D coverage gap, and (3) compute the likelihood for financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs using variables for year, prescription drug insurance coverage, health-related information, and demographics. METHODS: Data were obtained from 4 nationally distributed, crosssectional surveys of older adults to track coverage for and financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs. Surveys in 1998 and 2001 were mailed to national random samples of US seniors. Of 2,434 deliverable surveys, 700 (29%) provided useable data. Data were collected in 2015 and 2021 via online surveys sent to samples of US adults. Of 27,694 usable responses, 4,445 were from older adults. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses described relationships among financial hardship and demographics, diagnoses, and daily prescription drug use. RESULTS: Five percent of older adults lacked prescription drug coverage in 2021, continuing a downward trend from 32% in 1998, 29% in 2001, and 9% in 2015. Contrastingly, 20% of older adults reported financial hardship from prescription drug purchases in 2021, bending an upward trend from 19% in 1998, 31% in 2001, and 36% in 2015. Financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs was more likely to be reported by older adults lacking prescription drug insurance, taking multiple medications daily, and having a low annual household income across all survey years. The latter 2 of these 3 factors were still predictive of financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs among older adults with prescription drug insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Financial hardship from purchasing prescription drugs is still experienced by many older adults after the full implementation of the MMA and ACA. Lacking prescription drug coverage, taking more than 5 prescription drugs daily, and a low annual household income may increase the likelihood of experiencing this financial hardship. Pharmacists can be a resource for older adults making choices about their prescription drug coverages and purchases.

1865,35471247,"Critical Care Nurses' Knowledge of Correct Line Types for Administration of Common Intravenous Medications: Assessment and Intervention Study. BACKGROUND There is a paucity of information in the literature on core nursing staff knowledge on the requirements of specific intravenous administration lines for medications regularly given in critical care. There is also a lack of well-researched and appropriate information in the literature for intravenous administration line selection, and the need for filtration, protection from light, and other line-material selection precautions for many critical and noncritical medications used in these settings to maintain their potency and efficacy. OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the knowledge gap of clinicians with respect to intravenous administration line set material requirements for critical care medications. METHODS Data were drawn from a clinician knowledge questionnaire, a region-wide database of administered infusions, and regional data on standard and special intravenous administration line consumption for 1 year (2019-2020) from an enterprise resource planning system log. The clinician knowledge questionnaire was validated with 3 groups (n=35) and then released for a general survey of critical care nurses (n=72) by assessing response dispersal and interrater reliability (Cronbach α=.889). Correct answers were determined by referencing available literature, with consensus between the team's pharmacists. Percentage deviations from correct answers (which had multiple possible selections) were calculated for control and test groups. We reviewed all 3 sources of information to identify the gap between required usage and real usage, and the impact of knowledge deficits on this disparity. RESULTS Percentage deviations from correct answers were substantial in the control groups and extensive in the test group for all medications tested (percentage deviation range -43% to 93%), with the exception of for total parenteral nutrition. Respondents scored poorly on questions about medications requiring light protection, and there was a difference of 2.75% between actual consumption of lines and expected consumption based on medication type requirement. Confusion over the requirements for low-sorbing lines, light protection of infusions, and the requirement for filtration of specific solutions was evident in all evidence sources. The consumption of low-sorbing lines (125,090/1,454,440, 8.60%) was larger than the regional data of medication usage data would suggest as being appropriate (15,063/592,392, 2.54%). CONCLUSIONS There is no single source of truth for clinicians on the interactions of critical care intravenous medications and administration line materials, protection from light, and filtration. Nursing staff showed limited knowledge of these requirements. To reduce clinical variability in this area, it is desirable to have succinct easy-to-access information available for clinicians to make decisions on which administration line type to use for each medication. The study's results will be used to formulate solutions for bedside delivery of accurate information on special intravenous line requirements for critical care medications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1866,35472143,"Multicentre prospective observational study on community pharmacist interventions to reduce inappropriate medications. OBJECTIVES The status of community pharmacists' involvement in inappropriate prescription practices among outpatients who visit community pharmacies has not been reported in Japan. Therefore, this study described community pharmacists' interventions aimed at the discontinuation of inappropriate drugs or the reduction of drug doses. METHODS We conducted a multicentre prospective observational study of pharmacists' interventions on inappropriate prescriptions for outpatients during a 1-month period in September 2018. A total of 28 pharmacists from 28 community pharmacies in Japan participated in this study. We analysed cases in which pharmacists discontinued drugs or changed the doses due to drugs being inappropriate, adverse effects, duplication of pharmacological effects and drug-drug interactions. KEY FINDINGS Community pharmacists provided interventions for 736 patients at an average of 26.2 patients per day during the study period. The pharmacists recommended that doctors discontinue inappropriate drugs or reduce the doses of regular drugs for 103 patients (13.9%). Among the 107 pharmacist recommendations to decrease inappropriate prescriptions, 83 (77.6%) were accepted, including 62 cases of discontinuation (57.9%) and 21 of drug dose reduction (19.6%). A total of 122 drugs were discontinued according to pharmacists' recommendations. In addition, pharmacists' intervention improved sleepiness, sedation and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS This study shows the active involvement of community pharmacists in polypharmacy by discontinuing inappropriate drugs or reducing the dose of regular drugs, which may contribute to the improvement of adverse effects among outpatients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1867,35472247,"A randomized controlled trial of a pharmacist-led intervention to enhance knowledge of Vietnamese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVES We aimed to assess whether a pharmacist-led intervention enhances knowledge, medication adherence and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS We conducted a single-blinded randomized controlled trial in Vietnam. Individuals with T2DM were recruited from a general hospital and randomly allocated to intervention and routine care. The intervention group received routine care plus counselling intervention by a pharmacist, including providing drug information and answering individual patients' queries relating to T2DM and medications, which had not been done in routine care. We assessed the outcomes: knowledge score as measured by the Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire, self-reported adherence and fasting blood glucose (FBG) at the 1-month follow-up. KEY FINDINGS A total of 165 patients (83 intervention, 82 control) completed the study; their mean age was 63.33 years, and 49.1% were males. The baseline characteristics of the patients were similar between the groups. At 1-month follow-up, the pharmacist's intervention resulted in an improvement in all three outcomes: knowledge score [B = 5.527; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.982 to 7.072; P < 0.001], adherence [odds ratio (OR) = 9.813; 95% CI: 2.456 to 39.205; P = 0.001] and attainment of target FBG (OR = 1.979; 95% CI: 1.029 to 3.806; P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist-led intervention enhanced disease knowledge, medication adherence and glycemic control in patients with T2DM. This study provides evidence of the benefits of pharmacist counselling in addition to routine care for T2DM outpatients in a Vietnam population.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
1868,35473928,"Healthcare professionals' perspectives on facilitators of and barriers to CKD management in primary care: a qualitative study in Singapore clinics. INTRODUCTION The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising globally including in Singapore. Primary care is the first point of contact for most patients with early stages of CKD. However, several barriers to optimal CKD management exist. Knowing healthcare professionals' (HCPs) perspectives is important to understand how best to strengthen CKD services in the primary care setting. Integrating a theory-based framework, we explored HCPs' perspectives on the facilitators of and barriers to CKD management in primary care clinics in Singapore. METHODS In-depth interviews were conducted on a purposive sample of 20 HCPs including 13 physicians, 2 nurses and 1 pharmacist from three public primary care polyclinics, and 4 nephrologists from one referral hospital. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed underpinned by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) version 2. RESULTS Numerous facilitators of and barriers to CKD management identified. HCPs perceived insufficient attention is given to CKD in primary care and highlighted several barriers including knowledge and practice gaps, ineffective CKD diagnosis disclosure, limitations in decision-making for nephrology referrals, consultation time, suboptimal care coordination, and lack of CKD awareness and self-management skills among patients. Nevertheless, intensive CKD training of primary care physicians, structured CKD-care pathways, multidisciplinary team-based care, and prioritizing nephrology referrals with risk-based assessment were key facilitators. Participants underscored the importance of improving awareness and self-management skills among patients. Primary care providers expressed willingness to manage early-stage CKD as a collaborative care model with nephrologists. Our findings provide valuable insights to design targeted interventions to enhance CKD management in primary care in Singapore that may be relevant to other countries. CONCLUSIONS The are several roadblocks to improving CKD management in primary care settings warranting urgent attention. Foremost, CKD deserves greater priority from HCPs and health planners. Multipronged approaches should urgently address gaps in care coordination, patient-physician communication, and knowledge. Strategies could focus on intensive CKD-oriented training for primary care physicians and building novel team-based care models integrating structured CKD management, risk-based nephrology referrals coupled with education and motivational counseling for patients. Such concerted efforts are likely to improve outcomes of patients with CKD and reduce the ESKD burden.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1869,35474155,"Minding the gap-an examination of a pharmacist case management medicines optimisation intervention for older people in intermediate care settings. BACKGROUND Whilst attention has been paid within the literature to examining potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) for older adults in a variety of care settings, less is known about the extent within intermediate care. Furthermore, few studies have examined the utility of clinical pharmacist involvement in this care context. OBJECTIVE(S) Determine the prevalence of PIP in intermediate care (IC) settings in Northern Ireland (NI), explore the utility of a novel pharmacist case management model at reducing PIP and to examine the association with subsequent healthcare utilisation. METHODS Secondary analysis of prospective data (N = 532) collected during a medicines optimisation pharmacist case management model in three intermediate care sites in NI. Independent prescriber pharmacists delivered the intervention. Variability in Medication Appropriateness Index score change (ΔMAI) from admission to discharge was examined using multivariate linear regression analysis. Multivariate logistic and Poisson regressions were used to examine the association between ΔMAI and likelihood and numbers of unplanned hospital readmissions within 30 and 90 days of IC discharge. RESULTS PIP was highly prevalent (89.5%) at baseline with significant reductions in MAI score achieved from admission (Median = 14) to discharge (Median = 0) (Z = -18.28, p < .001). The prevalence of PIP at discharge was 7.8%. No relationship was observed between ΔMAI score and unplanned hospital readmission. Those who received at least one educational intervention were less likely to be readmitted within 30 days of IC discharge (OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.03, 0.71, p < .001). Baseline healthcare utilisation consistently predicted healthcare utilisation post-IC discharge. CONCLUSIONS Drug-related problems persist for many older adults following acute care discharge and intermediate care may provide an ideal location for medicines optimisation interventions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1870,35474642,"Using qualitative methods to explore the dynamics of patients' perspective sharing in community pharmacy counseling- conversation analysis and video-stimulated recall interviews. Background For patient centered counseling to take place in community pharmacies, patients should feel encouraged to share their perspectives, yet studies show that this rarely happens. The process of patient perspective sharing relies on the interactional details that unfold during an encounter i.e. how patients verbally and nonverbally are encouraged to share their perspective, which in turn is affected by patients' and pharmacy staff members' psychological processes in the situation, i.e. how they perceive and feel when acting. Therefore, employing complimentary methods that study both interactional and psychological processes could deepen the understanding of the dynamics governing patients' perspective sharing in pharmacy encounters. Objective The objective of this study is twofold: 1) a methodological consideration of the benefits of employing Conversation Analysis (CA) and Video-Stimulated Recall Interviews (VSRI) in parallel, 2) to use the methodological combination to understand patient perspective sharing in community pharmacy interactions. Method A single case study of one pharmacy encounter to explore the objectives in-depth. This was done through video recording of pharmacy encounters and subsequent CA-analysis; VSRIs were conducted with the involved patient and pharmacy staff member and analyzed using a qualitative thematic approach. Results By exploring detailed interactional and psychological processes in parallel, specific occurrences which might hinder patients' perspective sharing were revealed. CA demonstrated that staff member's listening activities restricted the patient's perspective sharing. VSRIs with patient and staff member supported this result: the staff member had a narrow conception of what counted as suitable answers and did not consider listening an active process. The patient harbored shame about needing to take the medication which affected her behavior during the encounter. Conclusion The novelty of the methodological combination is promising in order to grasp the complex process of patient perspective sharing in pharmacy encounters, as it affords aspects such as emotionality to be considered a central part of pharmacy encounters. As a consequence, it is suggested that the psychological concept of mentalizing is added to pharmacy education, as it is a trainable capacity enabling staff to become aware of the mental states that affect both patients and staff themselves during the pharmacy encounter.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1871,35474643,"The effectiveness of pharmacist-based coaching in improving breast cancer-related health behaviors: A randomized controlled trial. Background Although pharmacists are trusted and easily accessible by the public, their role in changing health behaviours related to breast cancer has been rarely investigated. Objective To investigate the effectiveness of pharmacist-based coaching in improving BC-related health behaviors and knowledge in females, and to measure the comfort level toward this program. Methods This was a randomized controlled study carried out in community pharmacies in Egypt. Pharmacies included were asked to enroll 240 females into a trial, then equally allocate them into either active or control arms, and provide 12 weekly face-to-face coaching sessions to those assigned to the active arm. Pharmacists were also asked to survey females and fill a standardized data collection form at baseline, in the middle of coaching, at the end of coaching, and three months after coaching. Results The proportions of doing high physical activity, practicing healthy diet, and practicing breast self-exam three months after the end of coaching programme across the active and control arms were 52.17% versus 17.09% (p=0.002), 62.60% versus 28.20% (p=0.003), and 81.73% versus 23.07% (p=0.005), respectively. The mean scores of knowledge on BC symptoms, risk factors, and detection methods three months after coaching across the active and control arms were 4.10±2.47 versus 2.72±1.19 (p=0.038), 4.25±2.20 versus 3.28±1.48 (p=0.020), and .34±1.80 versus 1.72±0.68 (p=0.001) respectively. While most of the females participated in the active arm were comfortable toward the financial 94.78% and social 88.69% sides of the program, more than one-third (34.78%) of the participants were uncomfortable toward the competency of coaches. Conclusion Despite the need for some modifications, BC-related health behaviors and knowledge can be improved through pharmacist-based health coaching.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1872,35474644,"Pharmacy practice architecture challenges in handling COVID-19 pandemic - sharing experience from a Kosovo pharmacy practice. Background Community pharmacies deliver an essential healthcare service, which is broadly established, encompassing the favored and primary contact for community members. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to shift the pharmacy roles and services in order to meet the needs of customers. The important value of community pharmacies was more underlined during the pandemic crisis when they were supposed to undertake abundant precautions to avoid cross-infection among users of the space. Their responsibility is also to create a compatible, efficient, and safe environment inside their premises during this outbreak. The built environment is an important share of pandemic solutions and emergency planning preparations. Objectives The aim of this paper was to explore the preparedness of community pharmacies in Kosovo for the COVID-19 outbreak in regards to pharmacy design modifications while ensuring adequate medicine management, information, and public health. Consequently, at what stage can the pandemic affect the physical and built environment of pharmacies. Methods The methods for this study include a cross-sectional survey of 104 community pharmacies operating in seven municipalities in Kosovo during the pandemic. Data collection was conducted from October 1 to October 14, 2021, using self-administered online questionnaires. The questionnaire consisted of a combination of closed and open-ended questions, optional statements, and multiple answers. Data were analyzed in SPSS for Windows version 20 using descriptive statistics. Results The results show that communities should be prepared ahead in regard to the emergency situations and some of these preparations might be also part of the legislation requirements. Although the pandemic exposed many errors in the Kosovo community pharmacy system, it has also discovered a unique possibility for collaboration and novelty. Conclusions The study concludes with the recommendation for the architectural design of pharmacies to be positioned as an active mediator in the fight against the COVID 19, with a critical lesson aimed at the flexibility of the space to accommodate emergent situations and create alternative areas for use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1873,35474645,"Development and evaluation of an interprofessional student-led influenza vaccination clinic for medical, nursing and pharmacy students. Background Students in their final years of medicine, nursing and pharmacy degrees were invited to participate in an interprofessional influenza vaccination training course and clinic. Twenty-four students (8 from each discipline) were selected to participate. After vaccination training these students administered free influenza vaccines under supervision in two student-led clinics to 546 students in health and allied health programs prior to their clinical placements. Objective To evaluate the students' experience of the interprofessional vaccination training and clinic, and to evaluate the experiences of students who received their vaccination in the student-led clinic. Methods Before and after participating, students completed a questionnaire evaluating their perceived knowledge of influenza vaccinations, and their skills and confidence in administering vaccinations and the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). Eighteen students completed both the pre- and post-questionnaires. All students who received their flu vaccination were also asked to complete a short patient evaluation survey. Results The course resulted in significant increases in the students' perceived knowledge of influenza vaccinations (27.5% increase, p<0.001), skills in managing patients receiving influenza vaccines (23.9% increase, p<0.001) and confidence level to administer influenza vaccines (46.0% increase, p<0.001). While there was no significant change in any subscales of the RIPLS, open-ended responses indicated that the students enjoyed and could see the benefits of meeting and learning with and from students from other health disciplines.

1874,35474647,"The role of pharmacists in providing immunization to the general population: Are Lebanese pharmacists ready for this role? Background Vaccination rates remain suboptimal in multiple areas around the world in spite of evidence that immunization is one of the most effective interventions for precluding morbidity and mortality. Non-traditional vaccine providers are proposed to augment immunization coverage. Pharmacists can have multiple vital roles to educate, facilitate and immunize against vaccine-preventable diseases. Limited data are available around the expertise and practices of Lebanese pharmacists in providing immunization services. Objective This study aimed to determine predictors that are associated with vaccine administration by pharmacists in Lebanon, and to assess experiences and practices in providing immunization. Methods This is a cross-sectional study that included pharmacists from all over Lebanon. A web-based self-administered validated questionnaire was adapted with permission. A snowball sampling technique was used to collect data through an electronic self-administered questionnaire between March and June 2021. The web-link to the survey was also shared by the Order of Pharmacists of Lebanon with all registered pharmacists to gather a sample from different districts all over Lebanon. Results A total of 315 pharmacists were included. A significant positive association was found between completion of an immunization training program (ORa = 2.085, [95%CI 1.006:4.322], P = 0.048), full-time pharmacists (ORa = 2.504, [95%CI 1.156:5.426], P = 0.02), 1 to 4 years of practice experience (ORa = 3.855, [95%CI 1.849:8.039], P < 0.0001), geographic area of practice (ORa = 3.201, [95%CI 1.242:8.249], P = 0.016; ORa = 5.373, [95%CI 1.859:15.530], P = 0.002 for Beirut and Mount Lebanon respectively), educating the public about immunization (ORa = 3.012, [95%CI 1.281:7.083], P = 0.011); and vaccine administration.

1875,35474650,"What drives pharmacists' turnover intention: A systematic review. Background Pharmacist turnover can negatively impact not only on work efficiency, organizational performance, work productivity and customer satisfaction, but also on the quality of pharmaceutical services and patient safety. Turnover intention is a core antecedent of turnover. Turnover intention of the pharmacists is affected by many factors related to their organization or job. Objective To elaborate the factors affecting the pharmacists' turnover intention and their associations. Studies related to any factors affecting pharmacists' turnover intention in all pharmacy settings were included. The QualSyst assessment tool was used for assessing the quality of the included studies. Result For this systematic review, 3,822 studies were identified. Of these studies,20 studies were included. Thirty factors were explored and a model for pharmacists' turnover intention was produced. Organizational commitment, job satisfaction, career commitment, job stress, perceived organizational support, and work climate were frequently found as drivers to pharmacist turnover intention. Some of 24 other factors had both direct and indirect effects on pharmacist turnover intention via organizational commitment, job satisfaction, career commitment, job stress, and perceived organizational support. Many studies have reported that organizational commitment and job satisfaction had significant influence on pharmacist turnover intention in all settings. Job stress and work climate had direct and indirect effects on turnover intention of hospital pharmacists. Career commitment and perceived organizational support had direct and indirect effects on community pharmacist turnover intention. Conclusion The factors driving the turnover intention of the pharmacists in different pharmacy practices were different. It indicated that the further interventions should be different to improve the pharmacists' retention in each pharmacy practice setting. Our systematic review is beneficial to guide human resource management in pharmacy and useful for guiding the conceptual framework of future research studies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective To obtain feedback from experiential leaning (EL) leads about how competency-based assessments could be undertaken by EL facilitators, and to scope existing EL assessment structures in undergraduate Masters in Pharmacy (MPharm) programmes across the United Kingdom (UK). Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted utilizing a nine-item on-line survey, consisting of five open-ended and four closed-ended question. All UK universities with MPharm programmes (n=30) were invited to participate in the survey. Variables of interest were perceptions on activities and competencies that could be assessed by EL facilitators. The survey utilised a 5-point Likert-type response ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Other variables of interest were tools/methods that could be used to assess competency, and perceived advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods, the latter two captured via open-ended questions. Results Of the 21 universities that responded (Response rate: 70%), 17 were included in the final analysis. Fourteen of the 17 (82.4%) offered the 4-year programme, while 3 (17.6%) offered both the 4-year and 5-year integrated programme. Assessments were mainly undertaken by university staff (59%), with minimal amounts undertaken during EL (39%). There was unanimous agreement (100%) that facilitators could assess students' communication skills and professionalism during EL. No consensus, however, was achieved with regard to the tool(s) or method(s) to be used to assess student's competencies. There were 13 responses to the open-ended comments. An advantage noted was that EL facilitator assessment of students would allow for more accurate evaluation of students in the practice setting, while acknowledging barriers such as the burden of time and the lack of consistency in marking. To address this lack of consistency, the majority highlighted the need for facilitator training. Conclusion Minimal assessments are currently undertaken during EL, with students predominantly assessed on return to the university. No consensus could be achieved with regard to the tool(s) or method(s) to be used to assess students' competencies, suggesting that perhaps there is no one-size-fits-all, and that the tools and methods used should be informed by the competencies being assessed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1878,35475229,"Implementation and improvement of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for colorectal cancer surgery. Purpose Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) reduces postoperative complications and shortens hospital stays. We aimed to describe the implementation and improvement of ERAS protocols in our institution through a multidisciplinary team approach. Methods A multidisciplinary team comprised of colorectal surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, and a performance improvement team was launched to develop the ERAS protocol. The ERAS protocol was followed in patients who underwent colonic and rectal surgery between January and November 2017. The ERAS protocol comprised 22 elements in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases. After the initial application, ERAS compliance was monitored and audited every 4-6 months and improvements made as necessary. Results The length of hospital stay significantly decreased after the application of the ERAS protocols for colon cancer in 2017 and 2018. And there was no significant difference in the duration of hospital stay after applying the rectal cancer ERAS protocol. Moreover, after starting the colon ERAS, there was a significant decrease in the complication rate. Since December 2017, there was a continuous increase in the colorectal ERAS clinical pathway application rate, which remained high (>90%). The patient compliance rate significantly increased between 2017 and 2018, but slightly decreased again in 2019. Conclusion The application and continual improvement of an ERAS protocol are crucial. Improving compliance may result in better clinical outcomes. Additionally, the basic guidelines of ERAS must be applied and developed according to each hospital's situation based on the team approach.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1879,35475369,"Students' Reflections on Learning Experiences in Federally Qualified Health Centers.  Introduction: Final year pharmacy students participate in advanced pharmacy practice experiences in multiple settings. Each practice setting offers different opportunities for student learning and growth. Experiences at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) allow student pharmacists to work with patients with unique health and socioeconomic challenges. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of an ambulatory care rotation at an FQHC on pharmacy students' learning. Methods: Final year pharmacy students submitted weekly reflections about their experiences at an FQHC using the Driscoll method of reflection. They reflected on activities, examined their effects on learning and growth, and discussed the impact the experiences would have on future practice. Qualitative analysis of students' reflections was conducted to identify themes related to learning and professional growth. Results: Pharmacy students (N = 11) reflected upon a variety of topics during their rotations at an FQHC. Fifteen themes and 11 sub-themes were identified by the reviewers within 43 reflections. Reflections covered three general areas: types of experiences students participate in at an FQHC, current and future effects of those experiences on student learning or patients' health, and students' emotional reactions during the experiences. Conclusions: Student reflections demonstrated that rotation experiences contributed to their growth and learning in communication, collaboration, and empathy. Additionally, students indicated that they gained confidence and skills throughout the rotation. By identifying the meaning students attributed to their learning experiences, reflections can be used to assess rotation activities for modification or continued inclusion.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1880,35475401,"Pharmacy Students' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Awareness Toward Marijuana Use. INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of pharmacy students toward marijuana use. METHODS Pharmacy students were asked to complete a survey that assess students' knowledge, attitudes, and awareness toward marijuana use. This study also compared students' awareness about the harmful effects of marijuana in comparing with alcohol and smoking tobacco. Participants were asked about the possibilities of marijuana-induced cancer and addiction. RESULTS Twenty-three percent of pharmacy students reported having used marijuana at some point in their lives. In comparison with tobacco and alcohol, most of the students agreed that tobacco (49%) and alcohol (42%) are more harmful than marijuana (P < .0001). More than sixty percent of students considered marijuana as an addictive substance (P < .02). A 45% of students opposed the possibility of marijuana-induced cancer. Thirty-six percent of the students agreed that marijuana should be legalized for both medical and recreational use with a similar percentage of the students (30 - 32%) believed that marijuana should be legalized for medical use only. CONCLUSION With the prevalence of marijuana use and discrepancy among pharmacy students' responses regarding knowledge, attitudes, and awareness pharmacy schools need to adopt educational activities about the benefits and risks of marijuana.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1881,35475978,"Investigation of Intervention Solutions to Enhance Adherence to Oral Anticancer Medicines in Adults: Overview of Reviews. BACKGROUND Adherence to anticancer medicines is critical for the success of cancer treatments; however, nonadherence remains challenging, and there is limited evidence of interventions to improve adherence to medicines in patients with cancer. OBJECTIVE This overview of reviews aimed to identify and summarize available reviews of interventions to improve adherence to oral anticancer medicines in adult cancer survivors. METHODS A comprehensive search of 7 electronic databases was conducted by 2 reviewers who independently conducted the study selection, quality assessment using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2, and data extraction. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 checklist was adapted to report the results. RESULTS A total of 29 reviews were included in the narrative synthesis. The overall quality of the systematic reviews was low. The 4 main strategies to promote adherence were focused on education, reminders, behavior and monitoring, and multicomponent approaches. Digital technology-based interventions were reported in most reviews (27/29, 93%). A few interventions applied theories (10/29, 34%), design frameworks (2/29, 7%), or engaged stakeholders (1/29, 3%) in the development processes. The effectiveness of interventions was inconsistent between and within reviews. However, interventions using multiple strategies to promote adherence were more likely to be effective than single-strategy interventions (12/29, 41% reviews). Unidirectional communication (7/29, 24% reviews) and technology alone (11/29, 38% reviews) were not sufficient to demonstrate improvement in adherence outcomes. Nurses and pharmacists played a critical role in promoting patient adherence to oral cancer therapies, especially with the support of digital technologies (7/29, 24% reviews). CONCLUSIONS Multicomponent interventions are potentially effective in promoting patient adherence to oral anticancer medicines. The seamless integration of digital solutions with direct clinical contacts is likely to be effective in promoting adherence. Future research for developing comprehensive digital adherence interventions should be evidence-based, theory-based, and rigorously evaluated.",0,0,1,1,1,Unusual study type but included because study quality was evaluated.,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Oncology,,,,Ambulatory,
1882,35476628,"Analysis of prescribing error and pharmacist's intervention on obstetrics and gynaecology outpatient prescriptions in a Malaysian tertiary hospital.  Prescribing error in obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) poses harm to women and potentially to the foetus and new born. Pharmacists' interventions have been reported to prevent prescribing error from reaching the patients. Little is reported on the magnitude of prescribing error and pharmacist intervention in a subspecialised outpatient O&G setting. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of prescribing error and pharmacists' interventions at the O&G outpatient setting. This retrospective study involved screening of prescriptions for commission and omission errors. Acceptance, clinical significance and rationale for pharmacists' interventions were analysed. Of the 3883 prescriptions screened, 359 (9.2%) prescriptions contained prescribing error, mainly (52.4%) due to commission errors. Among the 395 interventions performed by the pharmacists, 207 (52.4%) were recorded for omission errors. All the interventions were accepted by the prescribers with 65.1% were categorised as 'very significant'. About 54% of the interventions were conducted to optimise treatment outcome. The prevalence of prescribing error and pharmacists' interventions on O&G outpatient prescriptions was found to be substantial in this study. Standard prescription writing guideline should be routinely regulated, monitored and educated among healthcare professionals. Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Prescribing error rate in O&G was found lowest in outpatient setting as compared to inpatient and high risk settings. Pharmacists' intervention performed at the centralised inpatient pharmacy unit or on-ward has shown to reduce prescribing error in inpatient settings.What do the results of this study add? This study identified that the prescribing error rate in a subspecialised outpatient O&G setting was within the range reported in high risk O&G settings. The number of prescriptions to pharmacists' intervention ratio of 9.8:1 was reported.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Further research, preferably qualitative in nature, is recommended to explore, identify and address the factors that may hinder clear, accurate and complete prescription writing practices.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1883,35476882,"Pharmacists' naloxone offering and dispensing practices. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this paper is to understand pharmacists' naloxone offering and dispensing practices and factors affecting those practices. The secondary objective of this paper is to refine an existing survey instrument and use it to understand pharmacists' naloxone offering and dispensing behaviors and factors affecting it. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS A statewide mail survey of pharmacists was conducted in Wisconsin using stratified random sampling. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to understand pharmacists' naloxone offering and dispensing practices and multiple regression analysis to understand factors affecting these practices. MAIN OUTCOMES (1) Pharmacists' practices about naloxone offering and dispensing; (2) factors affecting these practices. RESULTS Most pharmacies stocked naloxone (92.9 percent) and were under the Wisconsin standing order (80.1 percent). The majority of pharmacists reported that they occasionally (36.6 percent), rarely (29.3 percent), or never (21.5 percent) offer naloxone to patients. The majority reported that they occasionally (29.3 percent), rarely (52.4 percent), or never (15.2 percent) dispense naloxone. While most pharmacists were confident in their ability to initiate conversations about nalox-one, they were not confident on how to screen patients at risk for opioid overdose. Pharmacists offered naloxone more when they felt more confident initiating a conversation regarding the need for naloxone with patients (β = 0.50, p < 0.05). Pharmacists dispensed naloxone more when they have had more previous training about dispensing naloxone (β = 0.43, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Many pharmacists hardly offer or dispense naloxone under the standing order. Pharmacists may benefit from standardized training and resources about screening patients for risk of overdose and overdose risk communication.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1884,35476885,"Opioid abuse risk among student pharmacists. OBJECTIVE To benchmark opioid abuse risk among student pharmacists attending three northeast pharmacy schools utilizing the opioid risk tool (ORT). DESIGN A cross-sectional, anonymous risk assessment questionnaire. SETTING Three pharmacy schools in the northeast United States. PARTICIPANTS Professional year 1 (P1) through professional year 3 (P3) student pharmacists. METHODS ORT was collected and scored by investigators and inputted into an electronic format for analysis. Students voluntarily participated, and 812 surveys were completed during one course meeting time and day at each school. RESULTS The majority of students were in the low-risk category (n = 581, 71.6 percent). Additionally, 137 (16.9 percent) patients were categorized as moderate risk and 94 (11.6 percent) as high risk. No statistically significant differences existed when comparing risk groups across the first through third professional year student pharmacist cohorts. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of risk groups among the three pharmacy cohorts between low-risk versus the high-risk groups. When comparing risk groups by gender, males were found to have a statistically significant higher proportion of being classified as moderate or high risk. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study demonstrate that there may be some student pharmacists with an increased risk for opioid abuse potential. There is potential need for education regarding opioid risk awareness and abuse prevention, which may serve as a call to action for professional school students and practitioners to understand baseline opioid abuse risk if they require chronic pain therapy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

CONTEXT Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Symptomatic treatment is based on dopaminergic medications. In case of self-medication practices, there may be drug-drug interactions between over-the-counter medication and dopaminergic medications. Thus, the aim of our work was to develop a practical guide summarizing drug-drug interactions and assess it by patients and community pharmacy professionals. METHODS We performed a systematic analysis of drug-drug interactions between OTC medications available in France and antiparkinsonians (ATC Class N04) using Theriaque® and Drugs® databases, and summarized the results in a practical guide. We assessed patients' satisfaction by a questionnaire administered to hospitalized patients in a French expert center for Parkinson's disease. We estimated the impact of the guide on community pharmacy professionals through a survey online, by satisfaction, knowledge acquisition and estimated awareness in professional context. RESULTS We identified 16 OTC medication, related to seven symptoms, interacting with antiparkinsonians. We obtained 67 responses from patients, expressing high satisfaction. We obtained 101 responses from professionals, reporting high satisfaction, knowledge acquisition and increased awareness in professional context. CONCLUSION Our results highlight the relevance of the guide and suggest that we may increase its dissemination to patients and community pharmacies.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1886,35477358,"Prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications based on the STOPPFrail criteria in frail older patients with limited life expectancy: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND The recently developed Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions in Frail adults with a limited life expectancy (STOPPFrail) criteria can be helpful for screening medications (PIMs), but it is yet to be widely used in clinical practice. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of PIMs based on the STOPPFrail criteria (STOPPFrail-PIM) among frail older adults with limited life expectancy admitted to the geriatric center. METHODS This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in the geriatric center at an academic tertiary care hospital in Korea. We evaluated frail older adults with limited life expectancy who received comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) admitted between 1 January, 2019 and 30 June, 2020. Frail older adults with limited life expectancy were identified by geriatricians with retrospective records and the prevalence of STOPPFrail-PIMs was analysed by trained pharmacists. Descriptive analysis, t-test, and chi-square test were conducted using IBM SPSS software version 25.0. RESULTS Among 504 older adults who underwent CGA after admission, 171 frail older adults with limited life expectancy were identified by geriatricians and included in the study. An average of 11.3 ± 4.7 medications were administered regularly to each patient before admission. Overall, 97.1% (166/171) had at least one STOPPFrail-PIM, and the mean number of STOPPFrail-PIM was 4.2 ± 2.8. Drugs without clear clinical indication (A2) were the most frequent pre-admission STOPPFrail-PIM, followed by lipid-lowering therapies (B1) and neuroleptic antipsychotics (D1). The number of STOPPFrail-PIM was significantly lower at discharge than that at admission, with the decrease being the highest for A2 at 94.7%. CONCLUSIONS Most frail older adults with limited life expectancy had at least one STOPPFrail-PIM at admission, and the rate of STOPPFrail-PIM decreased significantly at discharge after the geriatric multidisciplinary team care. Further studies are needed to investigate the association between the use of STOPPFrail-PIM and adverse consequences in frail older adults.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of this study was to analyze the impact of compounded drugs prepared by hospital pharmacists on the quality of life of patients with genodermatoses. MATERIAL AND METHODS We undertook a cross-sectional study of patients with genodermatoses treated with topical medications compounded and dispensed by the pharmacy at Complejo Hospitalario Universitario in Pontevedra, Spain. We collected demographic data and answers to questionnaires examining generic and disease-specific quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and treatment adherence. RESULTS Nine patients were included. We observed a significant improvement in health-related quality of life following treatment with compounded drugs. Satisfaction with the topical medications was 2.8 on a scale of 0 (greatest satisfaction) to 25. Treatment adherence was 59%. CONCLUSIONS Drug compounding facilitates access to orphan drugs that are not available for many rare diseases. Few studies, however, have analyzed impact on quality of life in this setting. In this series of patients with genodermatoses, topical medications compounded and dispensed by a hospital pharmacy improved health-related quality of life. This preliminary study has given rise to a multicenter study of compounding for ichthyosis. We expect that analysis of a larger sample will confirm our findings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1888,35477626,"Predicting Potential Drug-Drug-Gene Interactions in a Population of Individuals Utilizing a Community-Based Pharmacy. INTRODUCTION Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. Drug interactions (DDIs) are among the most common causes of ADRs, and estimates have cited that up to 22% of patients take interacting medications. DDIs are often due to the propensity for agents to induce or inhibit enzymes responsible for the metabolism of concomitantly administered drugs. However, this phenomenon is further complicated by genetic variants of such enzymes. The aim of this study is to quantify and describe potential drug-drug, drug-gene, and drug-drug-gene interactions in a community-based patient population. METHODS A regional pharmacy with retail outlets in Arkansas provided deidentified prescription data from March 2020 for 4761 individuals. Drug-drug and drug-drug-gene interactions were assessed utilizing the logic incorporated into GenMedPro, a commercially available digital gene-drug interaction software program that incorporates variants of 9 pharmacokinetic (PK) and 2 pharmacodynamic (PD) genes to evaluate DDIs and drug-gene interactions. The data were first assessed for composite drug-drug interaction risk, and each individual was stratified to a risk category using the logic incorporated in GenMedPro. To calculate the frequency of potential drug-gene interactions, genotypes were imputed and allocated to the cohort according to each gene's frequency in the general population. Potential genotypes were randomly allocated to the population 100 times in a Monte Carlo simulation. Potential drug-drug, gene-drug, or gene-drug-drug interaction risk was characterized as minor, moderate, or major. RESULTS Based on prescription data only, the probability of a DDI of any impact (mild, moderate, or major) was 26% [95% CI: 0.248-0.272] in the population. This probability increased to 49.6% [95% CI: 0.484-0.507] when simulated genetic polymorphisms were additionally assessed. When assessing only major impact interactions, there was a 7.8% [95% CI: 0.070-0.085] probability of drug-drug interactions and 10.1% [95% CI: 0.095-0.108] probability with the addition of genetic contributions. The probability of drug-drug-gene interactions of any impact was correlated with the number of prescribed medications, with an approximate probability of 77%, 85%, and 94% in patients prescribed 5, 6, or 7+ medications, respectively. When stratified by specific drug class, antidepressants (19.5%), antiemetics (21.4%), analgesics (16%), antipsychotics (15.6%), and antiparasitics (49.7%) had the highest probability of major drug-drug-gene interaction. CONCLUSIONS In a community-based population of outpatients, the probability of drug-drug interaction risk increases when genetic polymorphisms are attributed to the population. These data suggest that pharmacogenetic testing may be useful in predicting drug interactions, drug-gene interactions, and severity of interactions when proactively evaluating patient medication profiles.

1889,35478500,"Deprescribing: What is the gold standard? Themes that characterized the discussions at the first Danish symposium on evidence-based deprescribing.  The first Danish symposium on evidence-based deprescribing was held in September 2019. The symposium aimed to increase the awareness of deprescribing in general, to discuss the importance of deprescribing, and, thus, a potential consensus on key issues on a national deprescribing agenda. The invited keynote speaker, Barbara Farrell, from the Bruyére Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada, presented their thorough work on deprescribing guideline development and application. The symposium consisted of two parts: Part 1 concentrated on establishing the need for deprescribing in our society. Part 2 consisted of a panel debate that put the practical application and implementation of deprescribing in perspective to the input from the audience and the structure of the Danish healthcare system. The panelists represented key stakeholders, e.g., clinical pharmacists, general practitioners, hospital doctors, Danish Health Authority representatives, health politicians concerning deprescribing in Denmark. The event allowed 145 participants to discuss the importance of implementing deprescribing in a Danish setting. This commentary highlights and discusses the major themes that characterized the symposium: ""why deprescribe?"", ""deprescribing research"" and a theme dedicated to ""problems of concern.""

1890,35478502,"Aggression towards clinicians within Opiate Substitution Treatment (OST) services: A survey of service providers. Background High levels of aggression towards staff in healthcare settings have been reported. It seems likely that workers in Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) would be at increased risk of adverse events and their consequences. Objectives This study aimed to establish if practitioners who provide OST are experiencing negative outcomes, specifically aggression, distress, and burnout, and to identify if workload and professional affiliation were associated with these risks. Methods A survey was conducted of OST practitioners in a single geographical region of New Zealand (population approx. 344,000). The survey asked for demographics (including caseloads), Perception of Patient Aggression Scale New Zealand Revision (POPAS-NZ), Kessler 10 (K10), Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview (SPRINT), and Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) and two qualitative questions asking about the best and worst aspects of working in OST. Results All recorded OST workers in the region (n = 181) were invited to participate, 95 practitioners responded to the survey (52.4%). This group included pharmacists, doctors, nurses, social workers and addiction workers. Results indicated aggression, distress, and burnout were being experienced by practitioners. Number of patients seen by a practitioner significantly increased risk of aggression (F(1,90) = 14.14, p < 0.001). Psychiatrists were the most at risk profession (p = 0.016). Burnout responses were high for around 20% of practitioners, with low numbers meeting criteria for distress and PTSD. Positive things about working in OST were relationships with patients, appreciating patient outcomes and positive team environments. Negative aspects were patient behaviours, maintaining empathy, and, administration tasks. Conclusions Aggression was a workplace hazard for OST clinicians. Low rates of distress and PTSD symptoms were reported and some evidence of practitioner burnout.

Background The ageing population with multiple conditions and complex health needs has forced healthcare systems to rethink the optimal way of delivering services. Instead of trying to manage numerous diseases in a siloed approach, the emphasis should be on people-centred practice, in which healthcare services are tailored to people's needs and provided in partnership with them. Objective The aim was to develop an interprofessional people-centred care model (PCCM), including the contribution of a clinically trained pharmacist for home-living multimorbid older people in primary care. Methods Participatory action research method, including the active involvement of healthcare professionals, was utilised to develop the PCCM in a public health centre in Finland. The data comprised interview transcripts, workshop materials, field notes, surveys, and memos and were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results The PCCM was developed in iterative phases, including planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. The PCCM comprised: 1) A self-management evaluation questionnaire sent before a home visit; 2) A person-centred patient interview at home with a named nurse and a pharmacist; 3) A nurse-led health review and a pharmacist-led clinical medication review; 4) An interprofessional (a GP, a pharmacist and a named nurse) case conference meeting; 5) A care plan, including health and medication plans; and 6) Health support and empowerment interventions. The PCCM shifted working practices in the health centre from parallel and consultative practice towards interprofessional people-centred practice and more holistic care. The patient's active involvement in their own care was encouraged. Healthcare professionals appreciated the advantages of the new skill-mix, including the clinically trained pharmacist. Building trust among healthcare professionals and between the professionals and the patients was essential. Conclusion The successfully developed PCCM improved holistic and more people-centred care in primary care.

Background Pharmacy Value Added Services (VAS) were introduced in Malaysian public health facilities to facilitate the process of medicine collection. Examples include Drive-through pharmacy, Medicine by Post, SMS Take&Go, Appointment Card and medicine locker, commonly referred to as Medibox. Objectives To assess the perception of VAS among pharmacy staff, and to compare the time and cost needed to prepare medications for VAS and conventional counter service. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 17 public health facilities across Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya from May until September 2020. There were two parts of this study: 1) a survey on the perception of VAS among pharmacy staff, which assessed respondents' experience of handling VAS and their perception towards the services; and 2) a cost analysis to compare the direct cost of preparing refill medications for VAS and conventional counter service, estimated from average salary and direct non-medical cost. Results 290 respondents answered the survey. Most respondents had a positive opinion about VAS. Lack of storage and insufficient manpower were the top two barriers in VAS utilisation and implementation as perceived by pharmacy staff. The average time (in minutes) needed to prepare one prescription was highest for Medicine by Post service (10.31), followed by Medibox (10.25), Appointment Systems (6.24) and conventional counter service (3.99). Medibox had the highest average cost per prescription (RM5.49), followed by Medicine by Post (RM5.05), Appointment Systems (RM2.89) and conventional counter service (RM1.75). Conclusions The majority of the respondents involved in this study acknowledged the benefits of VAS to patients, but there were aspects of the services that could be improved.

1896,35478512,"Pharmacist-led interventions during transitions of care of older adults admitted to short term geriatric units: Current practices and perceived barriers. Background During transitions of care, older adults are at risk of adverse drug events which could lead to avoidable hospital visits. Pharmacists are increasingly involved in care teams at various stages of the continuum of care. The types and frequency of clinical interventions performed by pharmacists in the geriatric practice setting remain poorly documented. Objectives This study aimed to describe the current integration of pharmacist interventions during transitions of care of older adults admitted in short-term geriatric units (STGUs) and to explore barriers and facilitators to their implementation in clinical practice. The secondary objective was to explore associations between certain patient characteristics and pharmacist-led interventions during transitional care. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted with pharmacists practicing in STGUs in the Montreal area, Canada. The application of 8 pharmaceutical interventions was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, along with as a retrospective chart review. Four semi-structured group interviews were conducted in order to identify perceived barriers and facilitators. Results Thirteen pharmacists participated in the study. In the questionnaire, medication reconciliation on admission and at discharge was reported as being performed at least half the time by 12 (92%) and 7 (54%) pharmacists, respectively. The retrospective chart review revealed that these interventions were documented in 95 (98%) and 25 (26%) files, respectively. While 35% of patients had a documented pharmaceutical care plan on admission, none was documented at discharge. Several barriers to implementing clinical interventions were identified such as lack of time, technical support, communication and standardization. Conclusions Pharmacists are involved at different periods of transitional care; however, certain barriers should be addressed in order to expand their role in discharge planning. Providing guidelines on what is expected at discharge and post-discharge, and having a practice focused on delegation and collaboration would help pharmacists increase their role throughout the transition of care of older adults.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background In the ever-changing roles of pharmacists, the evidence shows that the use of competency frameworks could aid in achieving professional performance development and ensuring a consistent quality pharmacy education. However, there is no national competency framework for pharmacists in Saudi Arabia. This study, therefore, uses an evidence-based method to identify the competencies required to support and facilitate the pharmacists' training and career development. Objective To assess pharmacists' perception of the relevance of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Global Competency Framework (GbCF v1) to their own practice. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of pharmacists in different practice settings was conducted between August and November 2020, in Saudi Arabia. The survey was adopted from the GbCF v1. A combination of purposive and snowball sampling was used. The relevance to the GbCF v1 was assessed using a four-point Likert scale. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results A total of 522 pharmacists participated in the survey. The study showed broad agreement on relevance to practice for 84% of behaviours included in the GbCF v1. The 'pharmaceutical public health' cluster scored the highest percentage of relevant responses (91.42%), followed by the 'professional/personal' cluster (87.08%), whereas the 'organisation and management' cluster scored the highest percentage of 'not-relevant' responses (18.40%). The observed non-relevancy was associated with gender, nationality and area of pharmacy practice (p < 0.05). Conclusion The competencies and behaviours included in the GbCF v1 are relevant to pharmacy practice in Saudi Arabia. However, some behaviours of the GbCF v1 require modification to be appropriate for the local needs of the Saudi pharmacy practice.

Background Real-time prescription monitoring (RTPM) systems are an effective tool to help health practitioners monitor opioid use and reduce opioid-related harm but little has been reported about the support required by pharmacists to engage with them effectively in practice. Objective To evaluate the current understanding and perceptions of Western Australian pharmacists regarding RTPM systems and opioid-related harm, and investigate their self-reported training and support requirements prior to RTPM system implementation. Methods This cross-sectional, prospective study involved an online Qualtrics survey distributed to Western Australian community or hospital pharmacists involved in dispensing and patient-centred roles via local professional pharmacy newsletters and social media. Data collection included demographic information, responses to authentic case scenarios and Likert-scale questions regarding perceptions and training requirements of a RTPM system, pain management and opioid-related harm. Descriptive analysis was utilised. Result Sixty-two pharmacists responded to the questionnaire. Most (58/61; 95.1%) had a positive attitude towards RTPM systems, but only 33/61 (54.1%) reported being prepared for its implementation. Perceived barriers to successful implementation included lack of remuneration (46/60; 76.6%), conflict with prescribers (40/60; 66.7%), increased workload (37/60; 61.7%), staff safety concerns (34/60; 56.7%) and lack of knowledge regarding RTPM systems (32/60; 53.3%). Even though most participants were satisfied with training previously received, over 90% reported requiring further training and education, especially regarding RTPM systems (51/57; 96.2%) and opioid-related harm (56/57; 98.2%). Conclusion Among a small sample of participants, there was a strong positivity regarding the value of RTPM systems and a high degree of receptiveness to further training in preparation for RTPM implementation.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1899,35478518,"Impact of an ambulatory care pharmacist on provider relative value units in a rural clinic. Introduction Collaborative team-based care models have been shown to improve the quality of care provided to patients and may increase productivity along with patient access to care. Productivity is often tracked via work relative value units (wRVU). The primary objective of this project was to evaluate how a collaborative practice model affects tracked productivity. Methods Data regarding wRVU were retrospectively extracted from the electronic medical record from a single center. De-identified data points included total number of patients seen and level of service billed for the visit. Visits were grouped as collaborative (physician-pharmacist) or independent (physician alone). Relative value unit totals were calculated separately for individual physicians and pharmacy visits and also combined for collaborative team wRVU totals. Wilcoxon and descriptive statistics were used for analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v 9.4 (Cary, NC). Results A total of 624 patient visits were reviewed. Total number of patients seen by physicians working in collaboration was on average 19.25 per day versus 12.9 per day for those working independently. When evaluating only the average per encounter wRVU for each provider removing collaborative patients, the three providers who worked in the collaborative model averaged 1.45, 1.48, and 1.55 wRVU per patient respectively, compared to those who worked singularly (1.37 and 1.30). This was found to be statistically significant in the unadjusted mixed model (P = 0.0476), but not maintained once adjusted. Conclusion Physicians working in collaboration with a pharmacist were able to bill at a higher level on average suggesting more productivity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1900,35478520,"Coaching ward pharmacists in antimicrobial stewardship: A pilot study. Background Ward pharmacists are well-positioned to enhance the activities of hospital antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs by reviewing the appropriateness of antimicrobials and making recommendations to prescribers. However, recent studies have identified gaps in ward pharmacists' AMS practice, knowledge, skills, and confidence which suggests education and training programs are needed. Objectives To describe, for the first time, an interactive educational activity - coaching in AMS - targeted at ward pharmacists and explore their perceptions of coaching as a mode of delivering education to improve AMS knowledge, skills, confidence, and practice. A secondary objective was to describe the type, frequency, and acceptance of AMS recommendations made by coached pharmacists. Methods This was a descriptive pilot study with a qualitative evaluation of pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of coaching. AMS coaching was delivered over 2 months in 2019 to pharmacists providing clinical pharmacy services to general medical and surgical wards. A focus group was conducted one month after the coaching period to elicit pharmacists' perceptions of coaching as a mode of delivering AMS education and how it impacted their AMS knowledge, skills, confidence, and practice. AMS recommendations made by coached pharmacists were prospectively recorded, and the prescriber acceptance rate was determined. Results Ward pharmacists reported positive experiences with AMS coaching and believed it helped them identify a range of recommendations to improve antimicrobial prescribing and increased their confidence to communicate recommendations to prescribers. Workload issues were identified as the main barrier to implementation. Suggestions were provided to improve coaching implementation feasibility. During coaching, 162 AMS recommendations were identified for a range of antimicrobials, and 69% (113/162) were accepted and implemented. Conclusions Ward pharmacists believed coaching improved their AMS knowledge, skills, confidence, and practice, including their confidence to discuss recommendations with prescribers. These results can assist with the design and evaluation of future hospital-based AMS educational initiatives.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1901,35478521,"Benefits, challenges and contributors to the introduction of new hospital-based outpatient clinic pharmacist positions. Background Pharmacists working within interprofessional teams in the outpatient setting are well placed to address medication-related problems before and after hospital admission. Therefore, exploration of these roles is warranted. Objectives To explore pharmacists' and other health professionals' perspectives of the impact of pharmacists working within interprofessional teams in outpatient clinics. Furthermore, we endeavoured to identify both the challenges and contributors to success with the introduction of pharmacists into these settings. Methods This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with both hospital outpatient clinic pharmacists and other clinic health professionals to gain an in-depth understanding of how the introduction of pharmacists into clinics impacted clinic processes, patient care, and relationships with other health professionals. Participants were recruited from the outpatient clinics who had recently added a pharmacist to their service. Participants involved in setting up the roles were invited to participate in a voluntary interview, the transcripts from which were analysed into themes and sub-themes using an inductive and deductive approach. Results A total of 34 staff were interviewed of which 68% were female and 74% were aged between 31 and 50 years. The cohort included 16 outpatient pharmacists, nine pharmacist team leaders, five clinic nurses and four clinic doctors (specialist consultant or registrar). Three overall themes were identified: the benefits, the contributors, and the challenges of introducing clinical pharmacy services to outpatient clinics. When establishing a clinic role, pharmacists' awareness, adaptability, and strong communication were shown to be key traits to building rapport and trustworthiness with the established clinic team. Conclusions When pharmacists are integrated into multidisciplinary outpatient clinics they and their colleagues believe that they provide benefits to the patients and the clinics. Decision makers need to be cognizant of factors that contribute to, as well as those that impede, the successful implementation of outpatient pharmacist roles.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1902,35478522,"Attitudes towards video communication for New Medicine Service at community pharmacies - A qualitative pilot study. Background New Medicine Service (NMS) is a community pharmacy service that can increase adherence among patients with a newly diagnosed chronic disease. NMS must be carried out by a pharmacist, which is a barrier for some pharmacy units with no pharmacist physically present. Video communication might be a way to overcome this barrier. Objective This study aims to explore both patients' and community pharmacy staff's attitudes of video-based NMS in a community pharmacy setting. Methods Semi-structured, telephone interviews were conducted with patients who have participated in video-based NMS. Focus groups with pharmacists who have carried out the video-based NMS and with staff that referred patients to the video-based NMS were conducted at community pharmacies. Thematic inductive analysis was used to analyse the interviews and focus groups. Results In total, 10 patient interviews were conducted, along with one focus group with four pharmacists and one focus group with 10 referring staff. Three main themes emerged during the analysis: (i) Talking to a screen, (ii) content of the NMS, and (iii) tackling the technique. Patients reported that their questions for the pharmacists were the same as if the NMS had been face-to-face. Pharmacists felt that they appeared more professional on video and that non-medical related conversation was reduced compared with ordinary face-to-face NMS. The referring staff either preferred referring to a video-based NMS over an ordinary face-to-face NMS or had no preferences. Conclusions Both patients and pharmacy staff had a positive attitude towards the video-based NMS, the content of the NMS and the performance of the IT-system. The consulting time was reduced for video-based NMS compared to face-to-face NMS, but that did not affect the medical related content of the NMS, which indicates that video-based NMS is possible without compromising the health related content.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1903,35478523,"CancelRx implementation: Observed changes to medication discontinuation workflows over time. Introduction When patients are seen in an ambulatory outpatient clinic, such as their primary care provider's office, the prescriber often stops or discontinues medications. Although medication discontinuations are documented in the clinic's health record, this information may not be communicated to the pharmacy. Within the last decade, CancelRx has attempted to address this issue by sending a message from the clinic to the pharmacy when a medication has been discontinued or changed. Objectives This project studied pharmacy medication discontinuation workflows and pharmacists' perspectives at 3 UW Health outpatient pharmacies before and after implementation of CancelRx. Methods CancelRx was implemented at UW Health in October 2017. Pharmacists from 3 outpatient pharmacies were observed at 3 distinct time points. The research team conducted 9 observations 3-months before CancelRx implementation (July 2017). Additionally, 9 observations were completed at 3-months after CancelRx implementation (January 2018) and at 9-months after CancelRx implementation (July 2018). Collective case study and comparative workflow modeling were used in this study. Observation field notes were deductively coded and aggregated to determine task frequency, occurrence, and patterns using an interpretivist theoretical approach. Results During the study, 106 medication discontinuation instances (referred to as cases) were observed; 28 cases 3-months prior to CancelRx, 59 cases 3-months after CancelRx, and 16 cases 9-months after CancelRx. Medication discontinuation tasks aligned with the predetermined workflow: receiving and investigating the discontinuation messages, matching the message to the medication in the patient's profile and discontinuing it, documenting and communicating the message to others as necessary. After implementing CancelRx, the workflow changed as most pharmacists eliminated the investigating and documenting tasks. Conclusions This study provided insight into the medication discontinuation workflow in community pharmacies, especially after implementing CancelRx. Organizations are recommended to proactively consider the implications for novel health information technology before implementation to anticipate workflow and pharmacy practice changes and improve acceptance and effectiveness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1904,35478524,"Clinical decision-making and dispensing performance in pharmacy students and its relationship to executive function and implicit memory. Background When providing pharmaceutical care, the pharmacist relies upon a clinical decision-making process that involves information gathering, clinical reasoning, and clinical judgment. Typically, pharmacists have to identify, retain and recall numerous pieces of key information arranged spatially in medical records and prescriptions or verbally from colleagues when making decisions. Executive function, including spatial working memory and verbal reasoning, along with other cognitive domains, will likely contribute to the elements that comprise this process. Objective To establish the predictive utility of markers of executive function and implicit memory on clinical decision-making and dispensing performance in pharmacy students. Methods MPharm students from two sites completed a battery of cognitive tasks designed to measure elements of executive and other cognitive functions (e.g., verbal working memory (VWM), visuospatial working memory (VSWM), and implicit memory (IM)). Performance on 2 clinical case studies was used to assess clinical decision-making ability (n = 16), and a prescription screening and dispensing assessment was used to assess dispensing accuracy (n = 32). A statistical model was built to establish whether executive and other cognitive functions markers can predict clinical decision-making and dispensing performance. Results Performance in VSWM test and IM tests were found to explain approximately 63% of the deviance in clinical decision-making ability (null residual deviance = 49.4, deviance explained by variables = 31.0; Matrix Model p < 0.01, Dot-clearing test p < 0.01). Performance is the VSWM, and VWM tests explained approximately 30% of the deviance in the dispensing task (null residual deviance = 7596.7, deviance explained by variables = 2099.3; Matrix Model*Baddeley Reasoning Model, p < 0.05). Conclusion The results suggest that specific cognitive domains contribute to the clinical decision-making process. This adds to a growing body of literature that highlights the importance of person-specific factors in predicting clinical competence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1905,35478525,"Pharmacists' views on the impact of the Falsified Medicines Directive on community pharmacies: A cross-sectional survey. Background The Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) was implemented to minimise the circulation of falsified medicines in the legal pharmaceutical supply chain. Whilst pharmacists are involved in the final step of the FMD requirements with the decommissioning of medicines at the point of supply to patients, limited research has been conducted to investigate the impact of fulfilling these requirements on the relevant stakeholders. Objective To examine community pharmacists' views on how the FMD has affected their practice. Methods An online survey was disseminated via email in June 2020 to pharmacists in Ireland (n = 4727), who were invited to participate if practising full time or part time in community pharmacies. Quantitative data were captured through multiple option and Likert-scale questions, and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were captured by use of a free-text box, with the open comments analysed thematically. Results In total, 618 valid responses were received (13.1% response rate). Most perceived that FMD requirements increased waiting times for patients (82%) and reduced time interacting with patients (65%). Only 28% agreed/strongly agreed that the introduction of the FMD legislation improves patient safety. In the open comments, the need for medicine authentication was acknowledged, but it was believed that this should be the wholesalers' responsibility, not pharmacists' responsibility. The additional step of medicines decommissioning was viewed as a time-consuming distraction to clinical checks that increased the risk for error. Pharmacists complained that they were not remunerated for the lost staff productivity or the additional software and equipment costs. Many pharmacists felt that the increased workload was disproportionate to the small risk of patients receiving falsified medicines. Conclusions Key stakeholder engagement is required to optimise the implementation and integration of the FMD procedures into community pharmacy practice with minimal impact on dispensing and without compromising patient care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1906,35478526,"A global study on job and career satisfaction of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. Background Job and career satisfaction of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists is imperative to ensure a motivated and effective workforce, and a secure future for pharmacy practice. In turn, this enables planning, deployment and long term implementation of global imperatives, through universal pharmacy coverage. Objectives This study used data from a global survey to determine the level of job and career satisfaction and identify factors that are most significant in determining satisfaction in early-career professionals. Methods A cross-sectional survey was distributed to members of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Young Pharmacists Group (YPG) via email and social media platforms from November 2019 to May 2020. A previously validated questionnaire using 5-point Likert scales was used. Data were analysed by exploratory factor analysis, using principal component analysis, oblique rotation, and reliability testing of identified components, followed by a comparative statistical analysis. Results A total of 1014 respondents from 92 countries participated in this study. Regions of domicile significantly affected job satisfaction (p = 0.004) and career satisfaction (p < 0.0001) scores. Pharmacists working in community pharmacies perceived lower job satisfaction measures compared to those who work in academic institutions (p < 0.0001) and industry sector (p = 0.012). There is a negative association between career expectations and job satisfaction and career satisfaction scores. The workplace climate is related to education and training opportunities, lower reported workloads, greater autonomy, and more remuneration. Conclusion This was an international study of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. Enhancing factors associated with job and career satisfaction is essential to support early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists in obtaining fulfilment and esteem in their chosen careers. Developing and implementing a well-framed system that provides a conducive working environment, remuneration, and greater autonomy could improve job and career satisfaction.

1907,35478527,"An exploration of barriers, facilitators, and practical solutions for adopting medication synchronization into community pharmacies: A qualitative analysis. Background Community pharmacies across the nation have adopted medication synchronization (Med Sync) services with the aim of improving medication adherence. To help incorporate Med Sync into a pharmacy's workflow, pharmacy associations and organizations developed implementation guides for community pharmacies. However, considerable variability in the adoption of this service exists as pharmacies struggle to implement Med Sync into traditional workflow. Researchers identified early adopters of Med Sync who dispense majority of their prescriptions as part of a Med Sync program. An exploratory study was undertaken with the aim to reveal themes surrounding facilitators and barriers to adoption of Med Sync in community pharmacies. Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the barriers and facilitators associated with Med Sync adoption in community pharmacies and generate practical solutions for service adoption. Methods Community pharmacies participating in the North Carolina's Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network (CPESNsm) who were early adopters of Med Sync and had greater than 50% of their prescription volume being dispensed as part of a Med Sync program were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted, recorded, and transcribed verbatim with representatives who led the adoption of Med Sync in their pharmacy. Inductive coding and summary analysis were used to analyze the interview data and determine themes associated with facilitators and barriers. Results Analysis of the interviews revealed four key themes: program organization, staff engagement, patient engagement, and provider engagements for Med Sync adoption. Each of these themes had several sub-themes, contributing to facilitators and barriers to Med Sync adoption. Subthemes of program organization included having organizational infrastructure, including a pharmacy software system, a dedicated area, and a consistent enrollment process. Subthemes of staff engagement included having a team-based approach, job training, and staff incentives. Patient engagement's subthemes included communication, finances, health literacy, and transportation. Provider engagement resulted with subthemes including lack of communication and provider-pharmacist relationships. Conclusion To ensure successful adoption of Med Sync into traditional workflow, community pharmacies should employ a multi-factorial approach that includes internal and external components to the community pharmacy. This study identified facilitators associated with successful Med Sync adoption such as adequate staff engagement and requisite program organization. Barriers hindering successful Med Sync adoption resulted from challenges with provider and patient engagement. This study also makes an important contribution by providing practical solutions to Med Sync adoption based on participant responses and identified themes and sub-themes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1908,35478528,"Pharmacy-faculty work-life balance and career satisfaction: Comparison of national survey results from 2012 and 2018. Background Changes in demographics and composition of pharmacy faculty, along with faculty perceived stress, work-life balance and career satisfaction have yet to be fully documented. Objective To compare recent results from a national survey of work-life balance and career satisfaction of United States (U.S.) pharmacy faculty with results obtained from a similar survey from 2012. Methods A 46-item anonymous survey administered via Qualtrics (Provo, UT) was sent to members of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) in 2018. Information regarding demographics, stress, work-life balance, career satisfaction and intent to leave academia was collected. Although not part of the previous survey, participant information related to bullying and abuse in the pharmacy academic work was also gathered. While actual p-values are reported for all comparisons, a more conservative p-value of 0.01 was chosen a priori to indicate significance as multiple comparisons were made. Results A total of 1090 pharmacy faculty completed the survey, comparable to the number obtained in 2012 (n = 811). Overall response rates were similar for both years. The majority of pharmacy faculty in 2018 were female, white, married or with partner, worked in a pharmacy practice department and for a public institution. Notable differences between surveys included an increase in females, more associate professors and an increase in non-white faculty in 2018, relative to 2012. Stress, as measured by mean Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores was also significantly higher in 2018 (16.0 ± 6.6 vs. 13.5 ± 6.7, p < 0.01) relative to 2012. Faculty from 2018 were significantly less likely to report an intention to remain in academia (61.8% vs 86.3%, p < 0.01), relative to 2012. A sizable number of pharmacy faculty surveyed in 2018 also reported observing or experiencing hostility in the workplace, which included either bullying or verbal or physical abuse. Conclusions The makeup of pharmacy educators has evolved quickly over the last several years to comprise more female and associate professors who work within a pharmacy practice department. Also noteworthy is the significant increase in self-reported stress over the six-year timeframe. The direct implications of these findings are unknown but suggest that pharmacy academia is maturing in rank and changing to reflect the current pharmacy workforce (i.e., more females and additional clinical practice roles). Increases in responsibility likely accompany these maturing roles and may, along with other factors, contribute to the observed changes in the reported stress levels among faculty. Further research is called for regarding the reported hostility in pharmacy academic workplace and dovetails with concurrent work being done on citizenship and organizational citizenship behavior among pharmacy faculty.

The pharmacy job satisfaction literature points to several predictors of job satisfaction, but educational debt and various work settings have not been previously examined. Objectives To identify predictors of Virginia pharmacists' job satisfaction. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from the 2018 Virginia Pharmacist Workforce Survey. Of 15,424 registered pharmacists, 13,962 (90.5%) completed the survey. Pharmacists who reported being employed and working in Virginia in the previous year (2017) were included in the analysis (n = 6042). Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression identified predictors of job satisfaction. Results Respondents were primarily female (66.3%), Pharm.D. degree holders (65.5%), with a 14.8-year average work experience. Most pharmacists (86%) reported being very/somewhat satisfied with their job. Educational debt was not significantly associated with job satisfaction. Significant predictors of job satisfaction included: being female (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.08, 1.52); working <30 (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.14, 2.84), 30-39 (aOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.02, 2.11), or 40-49 (aOR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.02, 1.98) versus ≥50 h per week; earning an annual income of <$50,000 (aOR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.38, 0.94) or ≥ $150,000 (aOR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.30, 3.23) versus $100,000-$149,999; working in an independent community pharmacy (aOR = 3.72, 95% CI 2.54, 5.44), health system (aOR = 3.81, 95% CI 2.78, 5.22), clinic-based pharmacy (aOR = 4.39, 95% CI 2.18, 8.83), academia (aOR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.97, 13.73), benefits administration (aOR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.71, 7.74), long-term home and home health/infusion (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.10, 2.67), mass merchandiser community (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.62, 0.99), or manufacturer and wholesale distributor (aOR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.97, 6.08) versus chain community pharmacy.

1911,35479501,"Using journey mapping to understand the patient experience with selecting a Medicare part D plan using a pharmacy consultation service. Background Patient experience with community pharmacy services can be informed by human-centered design principles and approaches. Pharmacy services may benefit from detailed evaluations of consumer experience and patient-centered service design. Objectives To use an online journey mapping platform to understand the patient experience with selecting a Medicare Part D plan for individuals that did, and did not, use a free, pharmacy-led, Medicare Part D consultation service. Methods This was a two-group cross-sectional survey study in a single, rural community pharmacy. Surveys consisted of 7 demographic items, 30 Likert-type items, and 7 open-ended response items. The pharmacy used purposeful convenience sampling to distribute a paper survey to individuals 65 years of age and older currently enrolled in Medicare Part D between June and August 2019. Surveys were distributed to 36 patients currently enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan, with 18 surveys distributed to patients who had previously used a pharmacy-led Medicare Part D consultation service and 18 surveys distributed to patients who did not use the service. Surveys were uploaded to an online journey mapping platform, producing data visualizations for each group. Multiple choice survey items were analyzed using descriptive statistics, wth service user and nonuser groups compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Open-ended survey responses were coded by the research team using an inductive approach. Results In total, 36 surveys were returned to the community pharmacy for a response rate of 100%. The journey map platform generated Persona, Empathy, and Current Journey outputs, which mapped Good Experiences and Bad Experiences within the Medicare Part D plan selection experience. Personas differed in their median household incomes ($25,000-$39,999 for service users compared to $50,000-$74,999 for nonusers). Empathy and Current Journey outputs showed that service users had a wider variety of emotions compared to non-users. Mann-Whitney U tests yielded 5 items with statistically significant differences (p-values <0.05) in the plan-selection experience, with both groups similarly uncertain about their plan decision. Qualitative responses indicate patient trust was universally important to a complex decision-making process. Conclusions An online journey mapping platform provided insight into how patients experience a pharmacy service that extends beyond satisfaction. For community pharmacies providing Medicare Part D plan consultation services, pharmacies should consider how they can improve the service experience through communication style and patient-centered service design.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1912,35479504,"A case of pharmacist-led care team interventions to maximize rural patient quality of life.  A 64-year-old rural home bound patient in Washington State was identified to be at increased risk for negative health care outcomes related to chronic end kidney disease and poorly controlled diabetes. The patient lacked understanding of the use of monitoring equipment as well as diabetes education to improve quality of health; he also did not have access to medical supply equipment. A pharmacist-led care team comprised of a pharmacist, a community health worker, and a home health nurse implemented comprehensive medication review techniques as well as direct patient care education to engage the patient in managing his health. Involvement with this home visit care team combined with the patient's recently developed interest in managing his health re-engaged the patient. He began attending more frequent visits with his providers and increased his interest in meeting with a diabetes educator at the local clinic. Resulting interactions with the patient's providers, pharmacy, and community resources increased patient's compliance, access to specialists of care, and in-home safety measures. Factors contributing to poorer overall health and higher rates of death among rural patients include increased travel time to health care facilities and providers, higher rates of unhealthy lifestyle choices such as cigarette smoking and obesity, higher rates of poverty and less access to healthcare in general.

Introduction Over half a million people experience homelessness on any given night in the United States. As a result of increased exposure to disease, violence, stigma, substance misuse and limited accessibility to health services, individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately affected by communicable diseases such as HIV and HCV with prevalence estimates as high as 21% and 36%, respectively. Pharmacists, being some of the most trusted and accessible healthcare providers, are in a unique position to have a significant impact on the nationwide initiatives in Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America and the National Viral Hepatitis Plan by offering preventative testing services and patient-centered risk mitigation counseling and education. This research looks to assess the health impacts associated with pharmacist-led HIV and HCV screening coupled with comprehensive education and risk mitigation counseling in adults experiencing homelessness. Methods This study was conducted in a single independent community pharmacy in Spokane, Washington which specializes in mental health services and serves a large proportion of patients who are experiencing homelessness. Study participants are walk-in patients of the pharmacy, over the age of 18, are currently experiencing homelessness, and have not received an HIV or HCV screening within the past 6 months. The study intervention includes a Risk Determination interview, administration of HIV and HCV point-of-care antibody test, comprehensive diseases state education and personalized risk mitigation counseling. Participants are then referred to a local health clinic for confirmatory testing, anonymous partner notification, and evaluation for pre-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. Results A total of 10 participants were included in the final data analysis. Majority of study participants were male (80%), heterosexual (90%) and over the age 30 (90%). A total of 8 participants (80%) had a reactive HCV screening and there were no reactive HIV screenings. Many of participants reported IV drug use with methamphetamine being the most used illicit substance. Half of all participants (50%) admitted to borrowing a needle for injection drug use within the past 6 months. Two participants admitted to having sexual intercourse with a partner who was known to be HCV-positive and both participants had a reactive HCV screening. All study participants reported at least one serious mental illness diagnosis and ongoing recreational drug use was cited as a coping mechanism in all participants. Conclusion Since efficacy of treatment is no longer the limiting factor in eradicating HCV and suppressing HIV viral load, public health efforts need to be refocused on patient engagement through preventative services in an environment that is less stigmatized than traditional testing sites, such as community pharmacies. Study participants were highly receptive to pharmacist-provided point-of-care screening services in the community pharmacy. Combining HIV and HCV point-of-care testing with comprehensive patient-centered education and risk mitigation counseling may result in lower rates of community transmission, improve linkage to care and may lead to long-term retention of marginalized populations such as those experiencing homelessness.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1914,35479506,"Biosimilar medicines uptake: The role of the clinical pharmacist.  The introduction of biological medicines has revolutionized the management of chronic diseases. Due to the high cost of biological medicine coupled with the fact that patents of many of these medicines are on the verge of expiration, manufacturers are exploring the production of biosimilars. The introduction of biosimilars has the capacity to increase competition among manufacturers, reduce prices, and improve patient access to these medicines. Therefore, a biosimilar is a new wave in therapy and treatment for the next few years. Despite the growing number of biosimilars approved for patient care, physicians' comfort in prescribing reference products against biosimilars and patient reluctance to switch from a reference product to a biosimilar are the major barriers for biosimilar increasing use. This paper aims to highlight the role of the clinical pharmacist (CP) in the utilization of biosimilars and the need for a pharmacy specialty regarding biosimilars. Of all the healthcare providers, CP has the most holistic view of the biosimilar products' clinical profile, and logistical and supply chain considerations. Thus, CPs are uniquely positioned to better educate all biosimilar medicine key stakeholders in an effort to increase access and rational use.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1915,35479837,"Exploring the role of pharmacy students using entrustable professional activities to complete medication histories and deliver patient counselling services in secondary care.  Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) allow tasks to be delegated to trainees. A new model of pharmacy placements was developed that used EPAs to appropriately supervise students providing patient counselling for inhalers, anticoagulation and simple analgesia at a tertiary care hospital. Students were provided with clinical communication training (e.g. how to do the counselling) as well as mandatory occupational training (e.g. fire safety). Data was collected (by students and placement facilitators) relating to the number of consultations (n = 1361) and patients who received counselling (n = 308) carried out by students (n = 71) over a 20 week period. Students documented these consultations, recording information such as the patient identification details, subjective and objective history, their assessment of the patients' need, as well as any action taken and any further planned action that was required. These notes were analysed using a Quality and Utility Assessment Framework by three clinical pharmacists. Data was analysed using simple descriptive statistical analysis on Microsoft Excel. Documentation was deemed High Quality (41%), Medium Quality (35%) and Low Quality (24%). The results indicate that pharmacy students can use entrustable professional activities to contribute to clinical services, completing high-quality patient consultations that have utility in clinical practice. Further work is needed to evaluate impact on clinical service delivery and establish the educational utility of using EPAs to support the pharmacy workforce to develop their consultation skills.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1916,35479839,"Quality of diabetes care among patients with schizophrenia. A mixed-methods study. Objectives Patients with schizophrenia are at high risk of developing diabetes. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia and assess their quality of diabetes care. We further aimed to explore the factors affecting diabetes care in patients with schizophrenia. Research design and methods We conducted a retrospective review of medical records for patients presenting with schizophrenia from October 2017 to October 2018. Thereafter, we conducted semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore healthcare providers' attitudes and perspectives toward diabetes care in patients with schizophrenia at a tertiary hospital for mental health services in Saudi Arabia. Results The prevalence of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia was 3.7%. The rates of annual testing for quality indicators of diabetes were 8.6% for HgbA1c and 31.4% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Screenings for albuminuria and examinations of the eyes and feet were not conducted. Documentation of smoking status was done infrequently (8.6%). The in-depth interviews uncovered issues with managing diabetes in patients with schizophrenia. We identified four themes: the consequences of poor quality diabetic care provided to patients with schizophrenia; problems with the identification of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia; challenges in the management of patients with both diabetes and schizophrenia; and opportunities to improve the quality of diabetes care provided to patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions This study identified areas that need a considerable amount of work to be undertaken in Saudi Arabia to help patients with schizophrenia. There are numerous opportunities for improving the quality of Type 2 diabetes care such as the involvement of pharmacists to effectively manage diabetes and expanding community-based health services to include mental health, which could accelerate improved care services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1917,35479840,"Community pharmacist engagement in HIV and HCV prevention: Current practices and potential for service uptake. Background The central Appalachian region is at an elevated risk for HIV/HCV outbreaks, primarily due to injection drug use. Regional risk assessments highlight gaps in the evidence-based continuum of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies to minimize HIV/HCV transmission. One potential strategy for increasing the reach of HIV/HCV prevention efforts in rural areas is through provision of services at community pharmacies. Objective To qualitatively describe community pharmacists' HIV/HCV-related prevention behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs in a 3-state central Appalachian region. Methods Key informant interviews were conducted with 15 practicing community pharmacists. Theory of Planned Behavior-based questions probed for perceptions about the role of pharmacies in preventing and reducing HIV/HCV outbreaks in rural areas through activities such as syringe services, screening for HIV/HCV, and linking people to treatment when appropriate. Investigators applied thematic analysis to deductively and inductively generate themes from the interview transcripts. Results Two overarching themes regarding pharmacist engagement in HIV/HCV-related prevention services were generated: 1) current approaches to primary prevention through nonprescription syringe sales (e.g., gatekeeping behaviors) and 2) potential for uptake of the continuum of HIV/HCV-related prevention services in community pharmacies. Future engagement of community pharmacists in the continuum of HIV/HCV-related prevention services comprised 2 subthemes as possible underlying factors: general and specific willingness to provide services and perceived fit within the pharmacy profession. Conclusions Central Appalachian community pharmacists express a general willingness to help patients who may benefit from HIV/HCV-related prevention services, but current engagement, willingness, and perceived fit for offering specific prevention services in the community pharmacy setting is variable. This has potential immediate implications, such as prioritizing the introduction of more widely accepted services (e.g., provision of HIV/HCV-related prevention education) to community pharmacy practice, and longer-term implications, such as the integration and framing of HIV/HCV-related prevention services as helping behavior within the pharmacist professional identity.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1918,35479841,"Establishing the acceptability and usability of an animated virtual patient simulation. Background An animated, video-based, virtual patient (VP) has been developed to allow pharmacists to learn how, and practice how, to advise patients taking non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants, a group of high-risk medicines. VPs are well-established resources but have historically only been accessed within specific online teaching sessions or at university sites; this new VP represents a mobile design that can be accessed from anywhere. Objective To investigate the usability and acceptability of the VP application with a focus on exploring perspectives on accessibility. Methods The study used an exploratory sequential mixed method design consisting of a satisfaction survey and interviews. Survey data were analysed descriptively to assess satisfaction with the application and to identify interview discussion areas. Interview data were analysed using the Framework Approach to thematic analysis. Participants were hospital or community pharmacists, or pre-registration pharmacists. Results A total of 94 survey responses were collected and 22 respondents went on to take part in an interview. Participants reported liking the concept and delivery of the VP, particularly the high-quality technology. They also reported finding it usable, and appeared to favour its mobility and accessibility, particularly as the VP can be used on any internet accessible device, including mobile phones, with no specific requirements. Amendments that were suggested included quickening the delivery of some animations and improving navigation within the application, possibly through a button to return to the previous step should a mistake be made. Conclusions The mobile VP appeared to be functional and usable, with the majority of users reporting satisfaction with use across a range of devices. Users reported positively about the VP's remote access, but navigation around the application requires development.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1919,35479842,"Physicians' views on cardiovascular disease risk prevention services by pharmacists and potential for collaboration. Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early identification and management of modifiable CVD risk factors are highly effective in preventing disease onset and/or improving outcomes in CVD. As highly accessible primary health professionals, pharmacists can assume a role in screening and risk factor management in collaboration with physicians; however, such prevention services are not established practice in Saudi pharmacies. Therefore, the aim was to explore physicians' perceptions about the utility of a role in CVD risk screening and management for Saudi pharmacists. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Arabic or English. All transcripts were thematically analyzed in an inductive approach after translation into English if required. Results A total of 26 physicians recruited from public hospitals and primary healthcare centers were interviewed. Most were unaware of pharmacists' potential to undertake a role in CVD risk prevention. Although there was broad support for the concept, they recommended physician-pharmacist collaborative models, extensive provider pharmacist training, and strict oversight by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH)/other official authorities to ensure service quality and sustainability, should implementation occur. Healthcare system reform was considered key to expanding private sector (i.e., community pharmacy) involvement in healthcare, as was incentivizing providers and 'marketing' for patient acceptance. Conclusion Physicians were positive about setting up a collaborative community pharmacist-physician CVD risk screening and management service model with the help of an authorized body within the Saudi Arabian healthcare system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1920,35479843,"Comparing trained student peers versus paid actors as standardized patients for simulated patient prescription counseling. Background Simulation can be a useful tool for teaching and assessing clinical skills, but can also be costly and faculty-time intensive. It is defined as a technique to create an activity to portray a real experience for purpose of practicing or evaluating. Simulations can use standardized patients (SPs), which can be paid actors (PASPs), staff and faculty, manikins, volunteers, or students from higher level cohorts, also known as advanced class standardized patients (ACSPs). Objective The objective of this study was to conduct a multifaceted analysis comparing ACSPs and PASPs, based on student performance in the assessment, student preference of SP type, and SP performance as an actor. Methods ACSPs and PASPs were used in a summative prescription counseling role play. For the evaluation, students counseled a SP about a new prescription medication and answered questions about taking an over-the-counter product with the new medication. The interaction was recorded and evaluated by faculty using a previously developed rubric. SP performance was evaluated by faculty using a separate rubric to determine how well the patient role was performed. A pre- and post-evaluation survey was completed by student pharmacists to gather student preferences about SPs and confidence in their counseling skills. Data were evaluated using a paired t-test. Results One hundred sixty-seven student pharmacists completed the summative prescription counseling evaluation. Student pharmacists performed well overall with minimal differences between SP types. Students preferred PASPs to role play the patient but felt that the actor type did not affect their performance. Conclusions ACSPs performed the role of the SP well for a summative prescription counseling session without impacting student performance compared to PASPs and with reduced cost. However, students preferred PASPs, and PASPs were better at role playing the patient.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1921,35479845,"Rural community pharmacist willingness to dispense Suboxone® - A secret shopper investigation in South-Central Appalachia. Background Buprenorphine access is limited for patients with opioid use disorder, especially in rural areas. Telephone audits have identified pharmacist limitations to the dispensing of buprenorphine particularly in independent pharmacies in comparison to chain pharmacies and in rural areas. The objective of this study was to assess rural community pharmacists' stated willingness to dispense buprenorphine-naloxone, and document potential bias and or stigma that the shopper experiences when asking about buprenorphine- naloxone. Methods To assess pharmacist willingness, a telephone audit of 15 rural Appalachian North Carolina pharmacies was conducted. Three secret shopper scenarios were utilized including one shopper posing as a new patient, one shopper posing as an out of state patient, and one shopper first asking about buying syringes. Encounters were noted by willingness to dispense buprenorphine, and shoppers were to note any potential stigma and or bias that they experienced while asking for Suboxone®. Results Overall, 60% of pharmacies audited indicated willingness to dispense buprenorphine without reservation, and 31% indicated willingness to dispense only under certain circumstances. Pharmacies tended to add more conditions to dispensing to the out of state patient (46%), such as only dispensing if the practitioner was from in state in comparison to the other shopper scenarios. Potential stigma and bias were encountered in 40% of the 45 encounters. Conclusion Although pharmacies overall seemed willing to dispense, nuances regarding who pharmacies are most likely to dispense are felt in rural areas. Buprenorphine access limitations were more common in independent pharmacies and more often placed on patients from out of state. Pharmacy- directed education is necessary to reduce stigma and bias and increase patient access to buprenorphine.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1922,35479846,"Evaluation of the impact of enhanced virtual forms and gamification on intervention identification in a pharmacist-led ambulatory care clinic. Background Adoption of healthcare technology in the ambulatory care setting is nearly universal. Clinical decision support system (CDSS) technologies improve patient care through the identification of additional care opportunities. With the movement from paper-based to electronic clinical intake forms, the opportunity to improve identification of gaps in care utilizing CDSS in the ambulatory care setting exists. Objective To evaluate the impact of CDSS-enhanced digital intake forms, with- and without aspects of gamification, on the identification of intervention opportunities in an ambulatory care pharmacy setting. Methods Patients were invited to complete visit intake paperwork via virtual forms as part of a CDSS-enhanced mobile application designed to identify potential interventions based on patient age, sex, disease state(s), and user-provided information. Patients were randomized to receive optional patient-specific health questions 1) with or 2) without elements of gamification. Gamification elements included trivia questions, fun facts, and the chance to win a prize. A retrospective review was used to assess interventions identified for a random sample of patients seen within the same time frame who did not utilize the mobile application. Interventions were compared across groups utilizing ANOVA. t-tests were used for a subgroup analysis. Results From January to May 2019, 353 potential interventions were identified for 220 study participants. 0.44 (±0.82), 1.8 (±2.0) and 2.1 (±1.8) interventions per participant were identified for the control, virtual forms, and virtual forms + gamification groups, respectively. Significant differences in intervention identification across groups were found using a one-way ANOVA (F = 17.46, p < .001). Post hoc analysis demonstrated a significant difference in interventions identified for those completing 50-100% (n = 32) and those completing less than 50% (n = 18; p < .001) of the optional health questions in the virtual forms + gamification group.

1923,35479847,"Impact of adherence goal awareness intervention on PDC in various settings: Does awareness help modify medication-taking behavior? Background Interventions to improve medication adherence in chronic conditions have shown limited success or sustainability. Previous data revealed that phone calls to patients regarding adherence goal awareness resulted in significant improvement in proportion of days covered (PDC). Objectives The objective of this study was to explore specific pharmacist adherence interventions via phone in various practice settings. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted with patients who belonged to university-associated health care settings [ambulatory care, chain store, small health plan, and federally qualified health center (FQHC)]. At each site, patients with at least one chronic medication and a calculated PDC < 0.80 were randomized into control (n=115) and intervention (n=126) groups. Control groups (C) received usual pharmacy communication while intervention groups (X) were specifically called by a pharmacist to be informed of PDC goals and their commitment to adherence. PDC values were calculated 3 to 12 months for both groups the time of intervention, then compared with each patient's respective baseline/pre-PDC. Results Data from a total of 241 patients were pooled to examine change in PDC. There was no significant difference between groups in baseline criteria or PDC. Comparing within groups, there were significant correlations between Pre- and Post-PDCs for the intervention group (X = 0.32 p < 0.05) alone. There were significant improvements from initial PDC to those calculated at the time of Post-intervention PDC within both groups, (C = 0.18 ± 0.28 p < 0.05) and (X = 0.16 ± 0.24, p < 0.05). Approximately 44% of all sampled patients reached their adherence goals (PDC ≥ 0.80) after 3-9 months. Conclusions Results suggested that patient adherence behavior may improve after any call made by pharmacy staff. This communication and attention from the pharmacy may be enough for patients to consider their medication-taking habits without the need for discussing specific goals and importance of adherence.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Other,

Interchangeability between biological medicines and biosimilars, and subsequent substitution by pharmacists represent an important opportunity for costs savings for health care systems. Because biological medicines are complex products, the expert role of the pharmacist to inform patients and support physicians is indispensable. However, regulations on substitution of biosimilars differ around the globe, such that a substitution that is allowed in one country may be forbidden in another. Overall, pharmacists' knowledge of biosimilar medicines is incomplete and hesitancy to engage in substitutions is perceptible.

1925,35479849,"Allergic rhinitis self-care advice in community pharmacies: A simulated patient study. Background Pharmacists and pharmacy assistants can support consumers by identifying minor ailments and providing evidence-based advice about treatment options. In the Netherlands, advice is based on national minor ailment guidelines and structured WWHAM questions (Who, What, How long, Action, Medication). Objectives To study whether pharmacy assistants provide guideline-compliant advice for allergic rhinitis based on WWHAM and condition-specific questions (When and Familiarity) and their association with appropriate self-care advice. Methods A retrospective study of the assessments of simulated patient (SP) visits regarding one condition- and two symptom-based cases of allergic rhinitis in Dutch community pharmacies. Pharmacies that participated in 2014, 2016 and 2018 were selected. SPs documented their observations of the problem analysis, dispensing and client interaction on a standardized scoresheet. Dispensing of an oral antihistamine according to the guideline recommendation was considered as the correct outcome. Chi-square tests were used to analyze differences in scores for problem analysis of pharmacies with correct and incorrect advice provision in 2014 and 2018. Predictors for correct outcome were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Data from 673 pharmacies were available for all three years. In 2014 and 2018, problems were presented as a symptom (running nose), and 41.2% and 21.1% of pharmacies dispensed an antihistamine. For the condition-based problem (allergy) in 2016, 96.0% of participating pharmacies dispensed an antihistamine. Both in 2014 and 2018, each additional problem analysis question increased the odds ratio of providing correct advice. Questions asked about 'hay fever symptoms', 'medication', 'when symptoms occurred', and 'familiar symptoms' were significant predictors of correct advice provision. Conclusions Most pharmacies provided appropriate advice for a condition-based request but less than half of them provided appropriate advice for a symptom-based request. More questions asked was associated with an increased chance of providing correct advice. Addition of condition-specific questions may improve the WWHAM-method.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear a disproportionately higher burden of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). Team-based care approach adds capacity to improve blood pressure (BP) control. This updated review aimed to test team-based care efficacy at different levels of hypertension team-based care complexity. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL for newer articles on task-sharing interventions to manage hypertension in LMICs. Levels of tasks complexity performed by healthcare workers added to the clinical team in hypertension control programs were categorized as administrative tasks (level 1), basic clinical tasks (level 2), and/or advanced clinical tasks (level 3). Meta-analysis using an inverse variance weighted random-effects model summarized trial-based evidence on the efficacy of team-based care on BP control, compared with usual care. Findings Forty-three RCT articles were included in the meta-analysis: 31 studies from the previous systematic review, 12 articles from the updated search. The pooled mean effect for team-based care was a -4.6 mm Hg (95% CI: -5.8, -3.4, I2  = 80.2%) decrease in systolic BP compared with usual care. We found similar comparative reduction among different levels of team-based care complexity, i.e., administrative and basic clinical tasks (-4.7 mm Hg, 95% CI: -6.8, -2.2; I2  = 79.8%); and advanced clinical tasks (-4.5 mmHg, 95%CI: -6.1, -3.3; I2  = 81%). Systolic BP was reduced most by team-based care involving pharmacists (-7.3 mm Hg, 95% CI: -9.2, -5.4; I2  = 67.2%); followed by nurses (-5.1 mm Hg, 95% CI: -8.0, -2.2; I2  = 72.7%), dieticians (-4.7 mmHg, 95%CI: -7.1, -2.3; I2  = 0.0%), then community health workers (-3.3 mm Hg, 95% CI: -4.8, -1.8; I2  = 77.3%).

Background and objective There is an increase in the global prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While it has been proven that pharmacist interventions improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), the economic impact of these initiatives is uncertain. Consequently, we aim to systematically review and synthesize the evidence surrounding the economic impact of pharmacist care in PLWHA. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, IPA via ProQuest, the Cochrane Library, and the CINAHL Plus databases were systematically searched. Original studies evaluating the economic effect of pharmacist-managed services for PLWHA were included in the review. The quality of the economic studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard (CHEERS) checklist. Results A search of databases yielded 4206 citations, four of which met the eligibility criteria. Three studies were conducted in a hospital-based outpatient facility, while one study was conducted in a community pharmacy setting. The types of ""pharmacist-managed services"" included targeted motivational education, pharmaceutical care, health screening for opportunistic infections, and referral to specialists. Two of the four economic evaluation studies had complete economic analyses and were rated as moderate in quality. In comparison with usual care, pharmacist services led to cost savings of (51.29 to 165.74 in 2021 USD$) per person per year, saving 18.5 h per patient per year, and a lower cost of generating 12 years of quality-adjusted life years. In addition, the benefit-to-cost ratio of the pharmacist service was 2.51:1. Conclusions The pharmacist-managed services demonstrated the benefits of improving overall PLWHA health outcomes in economic viability. However, future real world controlled, high-quality economic studies are required to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of these services, given the pharmacist's growing role in the health care team managing PLWHA.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Infectious diseases,,,,"Ambulatory, Community",
1928,35480600,"Prospective risk assessments of patient safety events related to drug shortages in hospitals: Three actor-level perspectives.  Background: The increasing number of drug shortages (DSs) worldwide calls for more proactive solutions to prevent the negative impacts of DSs on patient care. Such solutions require in-depth knowledge about potential patient safety risks related to DSs, the processes of recognizing and managing DSs, the contextual setting in which DSs occur, and the actors involved. Objective: The aim of the study is to use prospective risk assessment to identify patient safety risks in hospitals associated with the management of DSs among actors at national, regional and local level in Denmark. Methods: Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) was employed in composition with elements from the Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) and the Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP). Potential risks related to DS management across three actor levels (national, regional and local) in the Danish healthcare system were described. Each actor level consisted of six participants that were identified using a purposive sampling strategy. Processes and sub-processes related to managing critical DSs were outlined and the actors identified, prioritized and rated potential failure modes, causes and consequences related to the processes. Recommendations to mitigate failures were proposed for high risk failures modes. Results: Overall, a total of 167 failure modes were identified across the three actor levels. At the national level, the process of DS management consisted of 17 sub-processes, from which 71 failure modes were identified. Nine of them were rated as high risk. At regional level, 7 sub-processes and 33 failure modes were identified, of which 9 were rated as high risk. At local level, 14 sub-processes and 63 failure modes were identified, of which 32 were rated as high risk. The high-risk failures were related to a lack of IT support in the medication modules, underestimation of patient safety aspects, and insufficient personnel training and patient information. Conclusion: Exploring DS management failure modes across actor levels provided an overview of interrelated failures. Potential solutions related to high risk failures were developed to ensure that actors ensure patient safety related to DS in healthcare.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1929,35480602,"The implementation of a pharmacy residency program - A qualitative study on the diffusion of an innovation. Background Structured workplace training supports pharmacists in achieving individual career goals as well as health services to meet workforce development goals. Hospital pharmacy residency programs offer structured training pathways for early career pharmacists. A residency program was introduced in Australia, modelled on formal programs already established in other countries. Objective This qualitative study explored key stakeholders' expectations and early experiences with the implementation of a pharmacy residency program using an analytical framework derived from implementation science. Methods Three focus groups and seven semi-structured interviews were conducted over a 24-months period with pharmacy managers, senior pharmacists and resident and non-resident pharmacists from different Australian State and hospital settings. They were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed via thematic analysis using Diffusion of Innovation Theory as a categorising framework. Results Thirty stakeholders participated in focus groups and interviews. Three of the five main factors that influenced the adoption of an innovation according to Diffusion of Innovation Theory were identified as prominent, two as weaker themes. The relative or perceived advantage of adopting or participating in a residency program was identified as a major theme. Pharmacy managers and resident pharmacists regarded individual and workforce advancement as creating a potential advantage for them. The complexity of the program's implementation, with concerns about its resourcing requirements and sustainability, influenced uptake. The compatibility of the program with already existing training pathways was explored, with the residency sharing similar objectives with current pharmacy education and workforce development goals. Observability and trialability played lesser roles in facilitating program uptake. Conclusion The implementation and diffusion of the pharmacy residency program can be interpreted by referring to key principles of Diffusion of Innovation Theory.

Background Guided self-management of asthma supported by health care professionals is a well-established approach. For allergy patients, there is less guidelines and evidence for guided self-management than for asthma patients. Objective The objective of this study was to find out how commonly asthma and allergy patients receive written action plans, how much and from which sources they receive treatment information to support their self-management, and to identify associated factors that may influence the support of guided self-management, and if there are any differences between these patients. Methods A nationwide survey was conducted in Finnish community pharmacies (n = 785) in September 2016 targeting patients buying prescription medicines for asthma or allergies. Results Responses were received from 46% of targeted pharmacies. Around 73% of the asthma patients, 61% of patients at risk of anaphylaxis, and less than 50% of the other allergy patients had received a written action plan. The most common source of treatment information for both patient groups was pharmacists. Allergy patients sought information more from written sources than asthma patients. Older males and patients with lower education received less treatment information. About 10% of both asthma and allergy patients did not report receiving any treatment information. Conclusion The majority of asthma patients and allergy patients at risk of anaphylaxis had received a written action plan, while fewer than half of other allergy patients had received a written action plan.

1931,35480609,"Importance of pharmacist-patient relationship in people living with HIV and concomitant opioid use disorder. Background PLWHA commonly suffer from chronic pain that is often treated with opioids, leading to subsequent opiate use disorders. As the majority of Americans live in close proximity to a pharmacy, community pharmacists are well equipped to interact with PLWHA. Few data quantify the needs of PLWHA with OUD, or how they utilize community pharmacists. Objectives To characterize the perceptions of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and using opioid medications on the interaction with pharmacists. Methods For this study, a qualitative approach was used. A key purpose of interviews is to encourage and inspire the subject to share a significant event of his/her life with the interviewer. Recruitment for face-to-face interviews with PLWHA continued until saturation was achieved. The Theory of Planned Behavior was used to assess the findings from this study. Sixteen interviews were transcribed verbatim and content analysis was performed by two researchers using Dedoose®, a qualitative software. Codes were grouped based on similarities into categories that facilitated the emergence of themes. Results Content analysis revealed two major themes. The first theme presents the subjects' beliefs and opinions about pharmacists' interactions when picking up their opioid prescriptions. Several subjects described encounters with the pharmacists that facilitated a trustful relationship. In the second theme, the analysis showed that the relationship with community pharmacists could be improved by having a more in-depth counseling about opioid medication and abuse. Conclusions These data highlight how PLWHA would like to interact with pharmacists when picking up opioid prescriptions. These results depicted how some subjects are using the pharmacists as a vital resource for medication information. These findings also demonstrated how for some subjects a more detailed counseling session when they receive opioid medications could be crucial in changing their behavior.

Non-perioperative ambulatory care visits of patients ≥65 years old with sampling weights were used to provide national estimates of visits. Baseline characteristics were compared between visits for patients with and without dementia using Pearson's chi square or Student's t-tests. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds of receiving a new medication. Results 218,182,131 non-perioperative ambulatory care visits of patients ≥65 years old were included, 2.1% of which were for patients with dementia; these patients were older on average and had more comorbidities and higher ambulatory care utilization than those without dementia. New medications were provided at 26.3% of visits for patients with dementia. After adjusting for confounders, there was no statistically significant difference in odds of a new medication being provided between visits for patients with and without dementia (odds ratio [OR], 0.555; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.183-1.678). Differences were seen in the provision of cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics, and central nervous system agents at visits for patients with dementia (p = 0.0011, <0.0001, and 0.0011 respectively). Conclusion While fewer visits for patients with dementia provided new medications compared to patients without dementia, after adjusting for confounders no significant difference were identified. Significant differences were seen in the classes of new medications provided. Further investigation is needed to evaluate new medication usage and the utility of pharmacists in the care of patients with dementia at an outpatient setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1933,35480612,"Factors associated with medication adherence among people living with COPD: Pharmacists' perspectives. Background While medication is an integral part of the effective management of COPD, more than 50% of people living with COPD do not adhere to their prescribed medications. The drivers underpinning this observed behaviour are poorly understood. As pharmacists generally have the final interaction with patients prior to their use of medications, their perspectives may offer insights about patients' medication use that may improve our understanding of this complex issue. Objective This study explored pharmacists' experiences of providing care for patients living with COPD to gain insight about factors that impact their medication-taking behaviour. Methods Fourteen pharmacists who worked in practice settings across the South-East Queensland region of Australia participated in interviews between March 2019 and January 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Results Two overarching themes were identified which modulated medication-taking behaviour. Barriers comprised patient-related factors including, financial constraints, poor inhaler technique, and inaccurate beliefs; alongside pharmacist-related factors such as a lack of COPD-specific training and time constraints. Factors that promote adherence included patient education and monitoring and collaborative relationships between key stakeholders. Conclusions Medication non-adherence is common. While pharmacists expressed a desire to better support their patients, practical strategies to overcome the challenges that they face in clinical settings are lacking. Future research should focus on exploring ways to engage patients at the pharmacy level thereby enhancing the provision of services that would optimise medication adherence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1934,35480613,"A pilot study to identify elderly patients with cognitive impairment for clinical pharmacist polypharmacy review in General Practice. Background Polypharmacy in elderly patients is common with potential for harm. Cognitive impairment is postulated as the biggest contributor to poor medication management with increased risk of hospital admission. There is limited information about approaches to identify high risk patients for polypharmacy review. Objective Pilot study to determine if a new patient prioritisation tool would identify appropriate patients for pharmacist polypharmacy review. Method Prioritisation tool developed to rank community-dwelling elderly patients prescribed 10 or more medications with cognitive impairment for pharmacist polypharmacy review. Tool used General Practice (GP) appointments, Emergency Department attendances, repeat medications and cognitive impairment to create a score to prioritise review invitations. Reviews were completed by GP clinical pharmacists who recorded interventions and measured outcome assessments using the adapted RiO scoring tool. Results Polypharmacy reviews completed for 34 patients from three GP practices. Demographic results were 62% female (n = 21), median 78 years [IQR 72-80], median 3 comorbidities [IQR 2-4] with most reviews conducted face-to-face (n = 29; 85%). Pharmaceutical care interventions were hospital admission possible or likely prevention for the majority of patients (85%, n = 29) which contrasts with the historical level of 33% (n = 228) patients with traditional processes. Conclusion Pilot study demonstrated that the new tool identified appropriate patients for review prioritisation as patients had complex pharmaceutical care needs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1935,35480615,"The extent of community pharmacists' involvement in detecting and resolving Drug Related Problems (DRPs) in prescriptions - A real time study from Sri Lanka. Background Appropriate medication use is necessary to ensure patient safety. Drug Related Problems (DRPs) could result in patient harm. Purpose To assess the prevalence and types of DRPs in prescriptions, and the proportion of DRPs detected and resolved by community pharmacists during dispensation of prescriptions in a selected community pharmacy. Methods A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in a selected community pharmacy in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where one researcher reviewed for DRPs in systematically selected prescriptions (N = 400), and another directly observed the frequency of DRPs identified by community pharmacists in the same set of prescriptions. Actions taken by pharmacists on resolving DRPs were also documented. DRPs were classified according to a slightly modified version of Pharmaceutical Care Network Euro pe classification V8.01. Descriptive and comparative data analysis were performed using SPSS database V.21. P < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results Among 1986 medications, a total of 1211 DRPs were identified by researchers, of which only 441 DRPs were detected by community pharmacists who participated in the study (N = 24). DRPs identified by the researcher were related to medication selection (N = 15), medication form (N = 1), dose selection (N = 817), duration of treatment (N = 128), incomplete prescriptions (N = 128), and other (outdated prescriptions, missing unit of measurements, and ambiguous names of medications that could not be read by both community pharmacists and researcher) (N = 122) of which only one, one, 394, 13, five, and 27 were identified by pharmacists, respectively. Among 441 DRPs identified by pharmacists, 406 were resolved by them. Most DRPs were self-resolved by pharmacists themselves (367/406), while patients were also sent back to the prescriber (13/406), and some dispensation of medications to patients were refused (9/406). Conclusion Among the DRPs frequently observed in the sample of community prescriptions, the community pharmacists identified significantly fewer DRPs in relation to each type identified by the researcher, and pharmacists missed some, including incomplete prescriptions, that had potential to harm. Systematic and sustainable training of pharmacists on performing a preliminary prescription review and continuous education programs must be implemented to improve community pharmacist dispensing practices in this community.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1936,35480616,"Do medicines commonly used by older adults impact their nutrient status? Background Chronic health conditions and polypharmacy are common among the older population and associated with increased risks of adverse events, medicine-interactions, geriatric syndromes, falls and mortality. Poor nutrition is also common in older people. Causal associations between medication use and older people's nutrient status is seldom discussed. Objectives The objectives of this review were to summarise the literature reporting associations between medicines commonly prescribed to older adults and nutrient deficiencies, and to discuss the clinical implications and management. Methods Medicine information resources (n = 5) were searched for information about nutrient deficiencies associated with common medicines used by older people and listed within the top 50 medicines prescribed by volume on the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This was followed by a search for clinical studies published on PubMed from inception to April 2020. Data was extracted, tabulated and summarised with clinical information relevant to pharmacists and clinicians involved in the care of older people taking medicines. Results A total of 23 clinical studies were identified reporting medicine-induced nutrient deficiencies in older adults. Vitamin B12, sodium, magnesium were identified as the 3 main nutrients susceptible to deficiency by medicines used to treat cardiovascular disease, neurological conditions, gastrointestinal conditions, and diabetes. The coenzyme CoQ10 was depleted by statins.Conclusion: Certain medicines commonly prescribed to older adults are associated with nutrient deficiencies that may be clinically significant. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities and polypharmacy it is possible that some of these individual drug-induced nutrient deficiencies are compounded, warranting both clinical and research attention.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1937,35480617,"An in-depth examination of funded and unfunded cognitive pharmaceutical services. Background A substantial expansion in the scope of practice of community pharmacists has become evident over the years, with increased government remuneration pledged to support cognitive pharmaceutical services (CPS) delivery as part of the Australian Community Pharmacy Agreements. Exploring experiences in providing funded and unfunded CPS within the existing work environment will enable better understanding of community pharmacists' roles and responsibilities in delivering CPS. Objective To explore pharmacists' roles, responsibilities, experiences, and perceived impact associated with delivering CPS. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews (n = 25) were conducted with practising community pharmacists in Australia who were engaged in delivering CPS during the time when the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement (6CPA) was in effect. Verbatim transcripts were thematically analysed (inductive analysis). Results All participants reported an expansion of services being provided in community pharmacies. Pharmacists offered a broad range of CPS within the community pharmacy setting, via 6CPA-funded and non-6CPA or unfunded initiatives. Almost all participants reported that their pharmacy provided 6CPA-funded initiatives such as dose administration aids, clinical interventions, MedsChecks/Diabetes MedsChecks, and Home Medicines Reviews. User-pay services being offered included pharmacist-led flu vaccinations, opioid substitution therapy, sleep apnoea services, and absence from work certificates, among other services. However, profit margins on user-pay services were minimal. CPS provision was seen to have positive impacts at patient and health care system levels. Pharmacists felt they enabled timely and convenient access to health care for patients in the community pharmacy setting, and facilitated quality use of medicines, which in turn had positive impact on the community pharmacy business. Conclusions A prominent shift in the provision of CPS was evident. Professional services provision has become the status quo for the practice of the profession, indicative of a likely shift in the work value of community pharmacists. Pharmacists should be further recognised professionally and financially for their contributions as health care professionals within the broader health care system.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Interprofessional education (IPE) provides unique opportunities for students to better understand their roles, roles of other healthcare professionals, and prepare for teamwork for patient benefit. Interprofessional team education is recognized as a key element in the 2016 ACPE standards. Objective Assess student self-perceived competence in four IPEC domains after an inpatient simulation activity. Methods Pre/post-test design used the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Competency Survey. The activity included medical, nursing, social work, and pharmacy students working in healthcare teams to develop collaborative treatment plans for simulated patients with altered mental status. Results Ninety-seven health profession students completed the activity, while 49 second-year (P2) student pharmacists participated in the study. All completed a pre-test and 47/49 (96%) completed a post-test. At pre-test, students ranked themselves highest in abilities to respect patient privacy (100% strongly agree) and acting with honesty and integrity in relationships (100% strongly agree). They reported lower ability in describing team development process. At post-test, significant increases were seen in managing ethical dilemmas (p < .002) and respect (p = .49), though decreases were seen in using appropriate or respectful language (p < .02).

Background Asthma is a common chronic disease worldwide affecting an estimated 300 million people. Pharmacists can play key roles to support optimal health outcomes for patients with asthma. Goffman's Dramaturgical Theory was used in this review to critically examine the literature describing the role of pharmacists in asthma services. Objectives The aim of this review is to identify factors that influence the role of pharmacists in asthma care services. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted of seven electronic databases including: CINAHL, Midline (Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Embase and PsycInfo.). The search was not restricted by language or date of publication. Studies were screened according to inclusion criteria which included much relate to pharmacists, asthma services and include qualitative findings. Data was extracted and thematically synthesised to create demographic, descriptive and analytical findings. Results Eighteen studies were included. The majority of studies were conducted in high income countries, with most of the studies conducted in Australia (n = 10). Semi-structured interview was used as a method for data collection in most studies (n = 11). Evidence indicated pharmacists engaged in asthma services positively and wanted to expand their roles in patient care. However, literature reported patients' attitudes and health-system factors such as remuneration, as well as inter-professional collaboration and expected low levels of knowledge and skills of pharmacists were barriers to implementation of pharmacy-led asthma care. Analytical findings suggest that pharmacists' involvement in asthma care services were influenced by patients' and healthcare professionals' expectations which were juxtaposed with pharmacists' own self-perceived identity. Conclusions This review demonstrates pharmacists self-identified as being capable and equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills, however the expectations of patients and other healthcare professionals prohibited their involvement in delivering asthma care services.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1940,35481111,"Community pharmacists on the frontline in the chronic disease management: The need for primary healthcare policy reforms in low and middle income countries.  In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), over 12 million people die yearly from chronic diseases and this number is expected to increase if concerted actions are not taken. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the roles and impact of community pharmacists in chronic disease management support and the need for policymakers in LMICs to reposition community pharmacists appropriately for this extended role. Recent findings have shown that community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare providers to the members of the community. Published evidence have demonstrated that community pharmacists' interventions in chronic diseases significantly improve economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes. However, they are not officially recognized as primary healthcare providers in LMICs. Therefore, there is need for policy reforms that will encourage strategic use of the clinical skills of community pharmacists as part of the primary healthcare team in LMICs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) play an important role in mitigating the prescription opioid epidemic by appropriate opioid prescribing and patient education. Yet, little empirical literature addresses pharmacist (and other HCP) communication with patients related to risks of opioid use associated with dependence, misuse, and overdose. Nor is there much research on the barriers and facilitators which affect whether and how much opioid-related information is discussed. This commentary, based on an extensive literature search, seeks to inform future communication, education, and research agendas by describing (1) topics commonly discussed or excluded from opioid medication counseling, (2) patient and HCP perceptions regarding opioid medication communication, and (3) barriers and facilitators to opioid risk communication.

1942,35481113,"Pharmacy students' perceived willingness and ability to negotiate for paid co-operative education positions. Background Evidence of a gender wage gap has been identified across many professions, with some evidence in pharmacy. Negotiation is one potential strategy to address this gap and it is underutilized, especially among women. No studies to date have examined pharmacy student perceptions of negotiation when applying for co-operative education positions - a potential sign of willingness to negotiate for entry-level positions upon graduation. Objectives To examine pharmacy students' comfort with and ability to engage employers in negotiation over wage and other work-related considerations for mandatory and paid co-operative education work terms at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada). Methods Two focus groups, one for female and one for male students, were performed with students who had completed at least one co-operative education placement. Focus groups aimed to elucidate students perceived ability to negotiate with potential employers, to identify strategies that educators can employ to better support students through the hiring and negotiation process, and to elicit student perceptions on the gender wage gap in pharmacy. Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data were coded inductively by two independent reviewers, employing thematic analysis. Results Three major and two minor themes were identified: Preservation of the relationship; Power differential and perceived ability to negotiate; Institutional support and training; Negative experience with negotiation and wage gaps; and the presence of a gendered approach to negotiation. Pharmacy students rarely engage in negotiation during co-operative hiring processes at the University of Waterloo, with some female students expressing hesitation to negotiate due to concerns about being perceived as ""bossy"". Students of both genders felt poorly equipped to engage in negotiation with a potential employer, and lacked confidence in initiating such a conversation. Conclusions Students identified a number of factors which influence their ability and desire to negotiate wages during co-op placement, including the requirements and logistics of placements, the perceived power imbalance between students and potential employers, and a concern that any wage negotiation may overshadow the value placed by students on the opportunities to provide patient care. Educators can play a role in equipping students, especially female students, with tools to enter into conversations on wages with potential employers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1943,35481115,"Clinical expertise, advocacy and enhanced autonomy - Acceptability of a pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention for community-dwelling Māori older adults. Background Pharmacist-facilitated medicines reviews are effective at identifying medicines-related problems and can improve the appropriate use of medicines in older adults. Current services in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) are not developed specifically for Māori (Indigenous people of NZ) and may increase health disparities between Māori and non-Māori. We developed a medicines review intervention for and with Māori older adults, and tested it in a feasibility study. Objective To assess patient acceptability of a pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention for Māori older adults. Methods The intervention consisted of a medicines education session (pharmacist and participant) and an optional medicines optimisation session (pharmacist, participant, and prescriber). Participant acceptability was assessed post-intervention using a structured telephone interview developed specifically for this study. Participants responded to statements using a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree-strongly disagree; numerical analysis/reporting) which focused on the topics of power/control, support mechanisms, intervention content and delivery, and perceived usefulness. Open-ended questions relating to the intervention value and suggestions for improvement were analysed using general inductive analysis. Results Seventeen participants took part in the feasibility study from December 2019-March 2020 and all completed the acceptability interview. Participants perceived the intervention content and mode of delivery to be appropriate, and that their power and control over their medicines and health improved and as did their confidence in self-management. Five themes were generated: medicines knowledge from a trusted professional, increased advocacy, 'by Māori, for Māori', increased confidence and control, and financial and resource implications. Conclusion A pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention for Māori older adults developed by Māori, for Māori, was acceptable to patient participants. Participants valued the clinical expertise and advocacy provided by the pharmacist, and the increase in medicines knowledge, control and autonomy.

1944,35481116,"Enhancing point-of-care testing through standardized training and redeployment of pharmacy technicians in the community setting. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of a standardized training model for technician-supported point-of-care testing (POCT) on the number of health screenings performed across two states in a large community chain pharmacy. Secondary objectives included the assessment of pharmacist and technician perceptions of advanced roles of the pharmacy technician in POCT service delivery. Practice description Certified pharmacy technicians (CPhTs) across six regional divisions of a large community chain pharmacy in Tennessee and Ohio participated in a standardized training program prior to implementation of technician-supported POCT. Practice innovation Standardized training consisted of pre-training assessments, online training modules, post-training assessments, followed by in-person skills-based assessments. CPhT participation was limited to technical tasks of POCT (e.g. sample collections, quality assurance). Evaluation methods The study addressed its primary objective by comparing total number of health screenings for included pharmacies in 2019 as compared to 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Perceptions were assessed using an electronic, Likert-type scale questionnaire. Results Pharmacies with technician-supported POCT showed a 46% increase in the total number of health screenings performed vs. 2019. The survey found that 74% (106/144) of pharmacists and 83% (34/41) of CPhTs agreed or strongly agreed that technician-supported POCT is acceptable for their practice site. Most pharmacy personnel agreed or strongly agreed that the service was appropriate and feasible for their respective practice sites. Conclusion This study provided supporting evidence that technician-supported POCT may positively impact the number of health screenings conducted in a community pharmacy setting. Standardization of training may allow for expansion of this service across additional states. Furthermore, pharmacy personnel perceptions were overall positive.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1945,35481120,"An analysis of pharmacists' workplace patient safety perceptions across practice setting and role characteristics. Background Lay press investigations have been published that describe pharmacist errors and the workplace environment in the community pharmacy setting. However, recent studies that explore pharmacists' perceptions of patient safety in the workplace are limited. Objectives 1) To describe pharmacists' perceptions of workplace patient safety; 2) To compare pharmacists' perceptions of workplace patient safety across practice setting type, pharmacist roles, average hours worked per shift, and average hours worked per week. Methods Actively licensed Tennessee pharmacists were recruited from January 1 and June 30, 2019 to complete a 13-item survey of workplace patient safety perceptions ( N =1391). Descriptive statistics were calculated, and nonparametric statistical tests employed to compare differences in perceptions across practice setting type, pharmacist roles, and hours worked per shift and per week. Results Statistically significant differences in workplace patient safety perceptions were noted across practice setting type (p values <.001) and pharmacist roles (p values <.001). The extent to which pharmacists agreed/strongly agreed that their employer provides a work environment that allows for safe patient care ranged from 29.7% of chain community pharmacists to 85% of compounding pharmacists. Fifty-two percent of staff pharmacists, 56.5% of relief pharmacists, and 58.5% of managers/pharmacists in charge agreed or strongly agreed that their employer provides a work environment that allows for safe patient care, whereas 89.3% of regional managers/directors/vice-presidents and 72.5% of clinical/specialty pharmacists indicated the same. Average hours per shift was inversely correlated with perceptions of workplace patient safety (p values <.001). Conclusion Tennessee pharmacists' perceptions of workplace patient safety varied widely across practice setting type and pharmacist roles.

1946,35481121,"Exploring pharmacists' perceptions of integrating pharmacists into the general practice setting. Background In several countries worldwide, pharmacists have integrated into the general practice setting. This has resulted in enhanced medication management, a reduction in patients' appointments with general practitioners (GPs), and decreased medication costs. However, there is a paucity of research that has focused on exploring pharmacists' views of this emerging role prior to its implementation in countries where it is not yet commonplace. Objective To explore pharmacsists' perceptions of integrating pharmacists into the general practice setting, the proposed roles for such pharmacists, and the factors affecting integration. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with pharmacists in Ireland, who were sampled based on years of experience in community pharmacy and work location using convenience and snowball sampling. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, which subsequently underwent thematic analysis. Results Twelve pharmacists - with a median of six years' experience as a community pharmacist - were interviewed between September and October 2019. Four main themes were generated:(i) expectations of integrated role (including the importance of role definition, pharmacist experience, and increased job satisfaction);(ii) altered pharmacist-patient dynamic in primary care (including patient trust, patient safety, and the impact on community pharmacist roles);(iii) GP-pharmacist relationship (including pre-existing relationships, autonomy, reducing GP workload, and individual GP attributes);(iv) logistical issues and financial implications (including practice characteristics, co-location time, and supporting evidence-based implementation). Conclusion This study is unique as it has focused solely on exploring pharmacists' perceptions of integrating into general practice in a country where such roles are mostly non-existent. The attitudes of pharmacists in this study were primarily positive, for reasons such as intrinsic motivation, reducing GP workload, and improving patient health outcomes. However, the routine implementation of these roles will require funding and support from key stakeholders (other than pharmacists) and should be guided by the evidence from other countries.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1947,35481122,"Describing voluntarily reported fluid therapy incidents in the care of critically ill patients: Identifying, and learning from, points of risk at the national level. Background Fluid therapy is a common intervention in critically ill patients. Fluid therapy errors may cause harm to patients. Thus, understanding of reported fluid therapy incidents is required in order to learn from them and develop protective measures, including utilizing expertise of pharmacists and technology to improve patient safety at the national level. Objectives To describe fluid therapy incidents voluntarily reported in intensive care and high dependency units (ICUs) to a national incident reporting system, by investigating the error types, fluid products, consequences to patients and actions taken to alleviate them, and to identify at which phase of the medication process the incidents had occurred and had been detected. Methods Medication related voluntarily reported incident (n = 7623) reports were obtained from all ICUs in 2007-2017. Incidents concerning fluid therapy (n = 2201) were selected. The retrospective analysis utilized categorized data and narrative descriptions of the incidents. The results were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Results Most voluntarily reported incidents had occurred during the dispensing/preparing phase (n = 1306, 59%) of the medication process: a point of risk. Most incidents (n = 1975, 90%) had reached the patient and passed through many phases in the medication process and nursing shift change checks before detection. One third of the errors (n = 596, 30%) were reported to have caused consequences to patients. One quarter (n = 492, 25%) of the errors were reported to have required an additional procedure to alleviate or monitor the consequences. Conclusions Utilizing national incident report data enabled identifying systemic points of risk in the medication process and learning to improve patient safety. To prevent similar incidents, initial interventions should focus on the dispensing/preparing phase before implementing active medication identification procedures at each phase of the medication process and nursing shift changes. Strengthening clinical pharmacy services, utilizing technology, coordinated by IV Fluid Coordinators and Medication Safety Officers, could improve patient safety in the ICUs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1948,35481123,"An exploratory survey on the awareness and usage of clinical practice guidelines among clinical pharmacists. Background The NHLBI has not developed clinical practice guidelines since 2007. As a result, multiple organizations have released competing guidelines. This has created confusion and debate among clinicians as to which recommendations are most applicable for practice. Objectives To explore preliminary attitudes, awareness, and usage of clinical practice guidelines in practice and teaching for hypertension, dyslipidemia and asthma among clinical pharmacists. Methods Clinical pharmacists across the US were surveyed electronically over a two week period in Spring 2019 regarding utilization and knowledge of practice guidelines for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and asthma. Clinical cases were included to evaluate application of guidelines. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square analysis, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were conducted. Statistical significance level was set to 0.01 to account for multiple tests conducted on the same survey participants. Results Forty-eight, 34, and 28 pharmacists voluntarily completed hypertension, dyslipidemia, and asthma survey questions, respectively. Interactions by disease state (p < 0.001) revealed more pharmacists (93%) reporting to have ≤50% patient load in managing asthma and more pharmacists (95%) had read the full summary/report of the most recent hypertension guideline. Primary reasons why the most recent guideline was not selected were also significantly different by disease state (interaction; p < 0.001). For dyslipidemia and asthma, pharmacists had a higher mean rating of agreement (p < 0.007) in having the most confidence in the most recent as compared to older guidelines. Proportionally more clinical cases were answered correctly (interaction; p < 0.001) when pharmacists applied the most recent guideline for hypertension (84%), while the opposite outcome was found for asthma (27%). Conclusion While more pharmacists selected the most recent guideline for practice and teaching, there was inconsistent application of guidelines to clinical cases.

1949,35481124,"The pharmacist as a public health resource: Expanding telepharmacy services to address social determinants of health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background The advent of COVID-19 exacerbated the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) on patients' ability to manage their health, especially those with chronic conditions. Clinical pharmacists are well positioned to expand the patient care services they already provide to address patients' basic social needs, which may otherwise impede medication access and adherence. Objectives The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the feasibility of expanding a comprehensive medication management (CMM) telepharmacy service to include SDOH support. This service was offered as part of four primary care clinics in rural and underserved North Carolina communities. More specifically, the study aimed to describe the expanded service, evaluate stakeholders' experience with the service, and assess short-term impact on patients with diabetes. Methods Data collected over the first 4 months of implementation included administrative data used to describe the expanded service; a clinic survey and interviews to assess clinic team members' experience with the service; and patient surveys to evaluate patient satisfaction, as well as impact on SDOH self-efficacy and diabetes quality of life. Results Through SDOH screening, the pharmacist identified 26 unresolved COVID-prompted SDOH concerns across 66 patients. These concerns were addressed by the pharmacist through three types of brief interventions, including information provision/education (71%), access to resources (21%), and additional care coordination (7%). Clinic team members perceived the expanded service as highly satisfactory and beneficial. Patients also reported high levels of satisfaction and significantly increased their SDOH self-efficacy and diabetes quality of life as a result of the service. Conclusion These data provide preliminary insights into the expanded role that pharmacists can play to address current population health gaps that can directly impact patients' engagement with their medication regimen and overall health status.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1950,35481125,"Availability and use of number needed to treat (NNT) based decision aids for pharmaceutical interventions. Background The number needed to treat (NNT) is a medical statistic used to gauge the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The versatility of this absolute effect measure has allowed its use in the formulation of many decision aids to support patients and practitioners in making informed healthcare choices. With the rising number of tools available to health professionals, this review synthesizes what is known of the current NNT-based tools which depict the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions. Objectives To explore the current spectrum of NNT-based decision aids accessible to health professionals with a focus on the potential utility of these devices by pharmacist practitioners. Methods A literature review was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Methodology Register) for studies published between January 1st 2000 and August 29th 2019. The language was restricted to English unless an appropriate translation existed. Studies that reported NNT-based decision aids of pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions were included. One author performed study selection and data extraction. Results A total of 365 records were identified, of which 19 NNT-based tools met the eligibility criteria, comprising of 8 tool databases and 11 individual decision aids. Decision aids appeared in multiple forms: databases, pictograms, graphs, interactive applications, calculators and charts. All aids were accessible online with a printer-friendly option, and very few came at a cost (e.g. requiring a subscription or access fee). The main tool innovators were the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), with English being the language of choice. Conclusions Evidence that NNT-based decision aids can contribute to greater satisfaction and involvement of patients in medical decision making is limited and inconclusive. A case for the utilization of these tools by pharmacists has yet to be fully examined in the medical research. NNT tools may provide a valuable resource to upskill pharmacists in communication of research evidence.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Pharmacist-led vaccination that has the potential to ease the vaccination burden from general practitioners, is comparatively a newer service in New Zealand. However, to reap the maximum benefits out of this service, a consistent and effective promotion approach using various online platforms is indispensable. Objective To identify what online information the general public can find about which pharmacies across NZ provide vaccination services. Methods Every pharmacy in NZ was reviewed online to determine what vaccination information they advertised, then a sample of pharmacies were randomly selected from six District Health Boards (DHBs) to be called and confirm if the information they stated online was accurate. Results Whilst the majority (more than 70%) of pharmacies did provide information about their services online, only 31% of the pharmacies had vaccination information on their websites, 20% on Healthpoint, and 13% had the information on social media. The telephonic survey revealed various information discrepancies in more than a quarter of the sample. Conclusions A lack of online presence across multiple pharmacies is a pressing issue. Also, currently, NZ pharmacies do not have a very high online presence advertising vaccination services. Improving the amount and quality of this information is pertinent at this time as when COVID-19 vaccination drive may commence anytime, and the pharmacy sector will be well placed to conduct vaccinations on a large scale.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1952,35481127,"Ability of community pharmacists to independently perform CLIA-waived testing - A multistate legal review.  The scope of practice of community pharmacy has continued in its evolution into a clinically focused profession. A critical component to pharmacist clinical offerings in the United States is the performance of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (""CLIA"") waived tests. However, state laws and regulations greatly influence a pharmacist's ability to perform a CLIA-waived test. Based on this variability and lack of clarity in state laws and regulations, a legal review was performed, which focused on the following themes: 1) states which currently allow a pharmacist to independently perform CLIA-waived testing; 2) of those states, which states impose restrictions on the scope of CLIA-waived tests that may be independently performed by a pharmacist; and 3) states that impose restrictions on the ability of a pharmacist to independently perform CLIA-waived testing. Federal laws already exist that allow individuals, pursuant to certification, to perform CLIA-waived testing. This allowance presumably includes pharmacists if they follow federal law. However, some states regulate and restrict this area for pharmacists, contrary to these federal laws. States may see an improvement in patient care and further expand the practice of pharmacy by limiting restrictions on pharmacists to perform CLIA-waived tests and following federal allowances.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1953,35481128,"Supporting patients with unlicensed medicine use: Analysing the script schemas for prescribing, pharmaceutical assessment and supply.  Unlicensed medicines (ULMs) are those which have not received authorisation from a regulator, as such they do not have the same reassurances around safety and efficacy as licensed medicines. This study aimed to explore the use of ULMs from the perspectives of prescribers, pharmacists and patients within the UK National Health Service (NHS) setting. Grounded theory was used as a framework, conducting 28 semi-structured qualitative interviews with prescribers, pharmacists and patients across both primary and secondary care settings. Participants were identified from their known use of ULMs where possible and a theoretical sampling approach was used to support recruitment of participants based on the emergent analysis. Analysis followed a constructivist inductive approach, using constant comparison to develop initial themes. This was followed by two focus groups, one with patients and one with professionals where initial analytic findings were presented to participants to further support the development of themes. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Three sequential schema scripts were identified and used as a framework to explain our findings: ULM prescribing, pharmaceutical assessment of an ULM and ULM supply. Common and divergent events within these scripts were identified and analysed in an attempt to explain similarities and differences across primary and secondary care and between actors. The analysis identified issues around healthcare professional awareness of using ULMs, perceptions of ULM safety, challenges around what information should be provided to patients and by whom and adds to the debate around the place of ULMs in treatment pathways. This study highlights the need for a multidisciplinary conversation about how ULMs should be used in the NHS.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1954,35481129,"Feasibility of a pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention for community-dwelling Māori older adults. Background Pharmacist-facilitated medicines review services have been postulated as a way to address current inequities in health outcomes between Māori and non-Māori. These interventions have been shown internationally to improve the appropriate use of medicines but remain underutilised in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). By reviewing the literature and engaging with key stakeholders, we developed an intervention, which included collaborative goal-setting, education and medicines optimisation, for testing in a feasibility study. Objective To determine the feasibility (recruitment, intervention delivery, and data collection methods) of a pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention for Māori older adults, and proposed intervention outcomes. Methods This study was reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to randomised controlled pilot and feasibility trials and the Consolidated criteria for strengthening reporting of health research involving indigenous peoples: the CONSIDER statement. Participant eligibility criteria were: Māori; aged 55-plus; community-dwelling; enrolled in a general practice in Waitematā District Health Board (Auckland, NZ). Consented participants engaged in a medicines education component (participant and pharmacist) and an optional medicines optimisation component (participant, pharmacist and prescriber). Outcomes measures included: the feasibility of data collection tools and methods, time taken to conduct the intervention and research processes; medicines knowledge, medicines appropriateness and quality of life (QoL); pharmacist recommendations and prescriber acceptance rate. Results Seventeen consented participants took part in the intervention from December 2019-March 2020 with the majority (n = 12) recruited through general practice mail-outs. Data collection was feasible using the predetermined outcome measure tools and was complete for all patient participants. Pharmacist intervention delivery was feasible. A mean of 9.5 recommendations were made per participant with a prescriber acceptance rate of 95%. These included non-medicine-related recommendations. Conclusion The feasibility testing of pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention developed for (and with) community-dwelling Māori older adults allows for intervention refinement and can be utilised for further studies relating to pharmacist services in primary care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1955,35481130,"Experience and perspectives of users and non-users of the Ask your pharmacist teleconsultation platform. Background There is a growing trend concerning the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for seeking health-related information such as information on medications and side effects. However, people looking online for health information cannot always judge the credibility of the information. Objectives This study aimed to describe patients' and pharmacists' experience using an asynchronous teleconsultation platform entitled ""Ask Your Pharmacist"" (AYP) and gather their perspectives and those of various healthcare and social services professionals providing primary care. Methods We performed semi-structured individual interviews over the telephone with patients having used the platform, pharmacists providing teleconsultation services on the platform, and various professionals delivering healthcare and psychosocial services to ambulatory patients. The questions explored specific themes, such as the perceived utility and impacts of the platform. We transcribed the interviews and performed a content analysis. Results We interviewed eight patients, six AYP pharmacists, and 15 healthcare and social services professionals. Participants perceived that the platform was simple to use and accessible. They also perceived that AYP promoted the visibility and the value of pharmacists' services. Some constraints were also shared, notably regarding questions requiring immediate attention or about complex situations. Conclusions The experience and perspectives of users and non-users of the AYP platform are mostly positive, but concerns were also raised regarding patients' safety. Results suggest that AYP could be a complementary tool to offer to ambulatory patients for simple, general and non-urgent problems.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1956,35481131,"Systemization of a pharmacy technician career ladder in a multi-hospital system. Purpose Hospital consolidation into larger, systemized health systems has enabled system-wide standardization of promotion processes, including pharmacy technician career ladders. However, whether system standardization affects the job satisfaction or outcomes of pharmacy technicians is unknown. The purpose of this project was to assess pharmacy technician perceptions and outcomes after systemization of a pharmacy technician career ladder. Methods Pharmacy technician satisfaction scores and outcomes (promotion and turnover rates) were assessed in an eight-hospital health system before and after systemization of a pharmacy technician career ladder. Results Two hundred and forty-nine pharmacy technicians were employed during the pre-intervention (n = 104) and post-intervention (n = 145) time periods. One hundred and twenty-three of 145 (84.83%) pharmacy technicians completed a job satisfaction survey after implementation of the system-wide technician career ladder. Overall satisfaction for the career ladder averaged 3.8 ± 0.61 or between neutral to positive satisfaction. There was no difference in total satisfaction regardless of teaching (3.8 ± 0.59) or community hospital (3.8 ± 0.63) location (p = 0.53) or stratifying by Pharmacy Technician status. A total of 50 pharmacy technicians were hired during the study period, either during the pre-implementation (n = 36) or post-implementation (n = 14) time periods. Time to the first promotion averaged 1.73 ± 1.00 years in the pre-implementation period and 1.36 ± 0.55 years in the post-implementation period (p = 0.20). Technician voluntary turnover was similar between the time periods. Conclusion In conclusion, the standardization of a systems-level pharmacy technician promotion ladder from a single hospital to a systems-level was associated with positive job satisfaction and similar promotions and turnover rates as the historic, single hospital-based promotion ladder.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Telehealth addresses geographic barriers by offering routine, technology-based visits, and remote patient monitoring. Objective The study objective was to explore adoption perceptions of a tele-COPD program among community members in rural Western North Carolina (WNC) counties. Methods A convenience sample of 17 community members were recruited to participate in one of five 45-min focus groups. Before the focus group, all participants completed a brief demographic survey. Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, imported into MAXQDA v10, and analyzed thematically using established qualitative coding procedures. SPSS v22 was used to calculate descriptive statistics. Results Participants were primarily Non-Hispanic White (100%), male (59%), insured (100%), and had at least a high school education (80%). Only 25% of participants had any prior knowledge of telehealth programs. The majority (94%) of participants expressed interest in receiving a tele-COPD program due to convenience factors. Yet, most participants expressed a lack of interest and comfort in using Internet-capable devices (e.g., mobile devices, tablets, computers). Participants noted that to be successful, telehealth visits must be described and shown to them by their own provider or other trusted individual(s), such as a pharmacist. Privacy and cost were also expressed as telehealth concerns. Conclusion Interest in a tele-COPD program was high among community residents in rural WNC. However, to increase patient willingness to adopt a tele-COPD program, patients' providers must overcome challenges, such as patients' awareness and knowledge of telehealth, privacy and cost concerns, and access to and comfort with using new technologies. Pharmacists may mitigate these challenges by increasing patients' trust and comfort with telehealth programs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1958,35481428,"Prevalence and predictors of clinically significant statin-drug interactions among Yemeni patients taking statins for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND Statins are extensively used in clinical practice for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Statins are usually taken in combination with other medications. This may increase the risk of statin-drug interactions. The study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, patterns, and predictors of clinically significant statin-drug interactions among patients on statin therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted at the cardiology, endocrine, and internal medicine outpatient clinics in four tertiary care hospitals in Sana'a, Yemen. Lexicomp Drug Interaction database was used to analyze the prescriptions for potential statin-drug interactions. Binary and multivariable logistic regression were utilized for analysis. RESULTS Of the total number of patients (634), 114 individuals (18%) had a total of 122 statin-drug interactions. According to Lexicomp risk classification, 102 (83.6%) DDIs were class C (monitor therapy), 19 (15.6%) were class D (therapy modification), and only one (0.8%) class X (avoid combination). Simvastatin use was significantly associated with the presence of category D and X DDIs (15.9% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001). Polypharmacy (OR= 2.571, p < 0.001) and having ≥3 comorbidities (OR= 2.512, p < 0.001) were the only variables associated with the presence of statin-drug interactions (C, D, and/or X). CONCLUSION Patients with polypharmacy and those with three or more comorbidities had a higher risk for statin-drug interactions. Therefore, routine screening by physicians and pharmacists for potential interactions should occur before prescribing or dispensing any medication to avoid clinically significant statin-drug interactions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

ABSTRACT The medication therapy management (MTM) pharmacists follow the philosophy of pharmaceutical care to address individualistic medication therapy requirements in their practice settings.The present study aimed to introduce the pharmacist-delivered MTM services among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients at a tertiary care hospital in Nepal.Cross-sectional study was conducted at Patan Hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal, among 200 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from July to December 2019. The intervention included maintenance of medication profile for individual patients, and then MTM service was proposed based on 5 core elements of MTM services proposed by the American Pharmacists Association. Both antidiabetic and non-antidiabetic medicines were coded as per the anatomic, therapeutic, and chemical classification and defined daily dose assignment 2020 for documentation. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to index comorbidities. The drug interaction profile was checked with the Medscape Drug Interaction Checker.Both fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels were significantly associated with age (P-values <.000 for both), baseline symptom (P-values .012 and .003 respectively), and diet plan proposed (P-values .049 and .011 respectively). Maximum cases of drug interactions requiring close monitoring were between metformin and insulin regular (i.e., 11, 5.5%).This was a novel initiative of the MTM services in a resource constraint country like Nepal and can show a clue for the pharmacists targeting such services in other similar settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical evidence shows that specific population groups such as the elderly, individuals with comorbidities, and pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection and serious complications. In particular, physiologic changes during pregnancy may be significant on the immune and respiratory systems and progression of COVID-19 disease. Pregnant women are routinely excluded from pre-registration clinical trials, this potentially limits their access to therapies through off-label or compassionate use. Vaccination remains an important pillar of the response to COVID-19, particularly as variants of the virus continue to spread across countries.

OBJECTIVES To describe and analyze the roles of pharmacists in the multi-disciplinary protocols of French medical homes (MHs). METHODS Multi-methods study combining: i) a descriptive cross-sectional study identifying the MHs with active pharmacists in Loire-Atlantique and Vendée in 2020, ii) an analysis of the roles of the pharmacists within the multi-disciplinary protocols of these MHs, iii) a qualitative study by semi-directed interviews with the pharmacists participating in these protocols. RESULTS Among the 40 MHs in Loire-Atlantique and Vendée in 2020, 22 (55%) included a pharmacist and 8 (20%) reported at least one protocol between GPs and pharmacists. Three roles of the pharmacist were identified: identification of a target population according to the inclusion criteria of the protocols, counseling and education, and new missions of the pharmacist. The interviews carried out highlighted a gap between the actions stated in the protocols and the actions carried out with the patient. CONCLUSION There are many barriers to the involvement of pharmacists in the protocols: significant administrative difficulties, low financial profitability, lack of time, and even persistent mistrust between general practitioners and pharmacists.

1964,35483803,"Reflections on work-life integration post-pandemic: A perspective from pharmacy practice faculty. INTRODUCTION The effects of COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on how work is conducted moving forward. Prior to the pandemic, work-life integration and well-being were priorities for many organizations, including pharmacy. The disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic pushed businesses and organizations worldwide into an era of agility and flexibility previously unknown to the majority of workplaces. PERSPECTIVE Increased remote work has presented both increased challenges (e.g., engagement) and opportunities (e.g., productivity). After a year of experience, this shift in the nature of how work is done has provided an opportunity to reimagine how and where work will be conducted in the future. IMPLICATIONS Schools and colleges of pharmacy have an opportunity to re-evaluate how academic and practice responsibilities are accomplished in regards to work life-integration and management of concurrent work and family responsibilities. Administration and faculty should foster a culture of transparency on this topic to collaboratively incorporate methods that better facilitate work-life integration moving forward.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1965,35483805,"The PRACTICE framework for organising and delivering a learning event for pharmacists' lifelong learning. INTRODUCTION To date, there is no unified model in Great Britain (GB), or globally, that provides consistency in planning, delivering, and evaluating learning events, that can support pharmacists' lifelong learning. This poses ongoing challenges for quality assurance and standardisation. The aim of this study is to present the development and validation of a framework to support the planning, delivery, and evaluation of learning events. METHODS Development and design of the framework was a result of using triangulating methods capturing data from previous studies. Primary validation included face validation and content validation. Secondary validation involved using a think-aloud systematic process. Finally, the framework was trialed in practice by organising, delivering, and evaluating a learning event, following its guidelines. RESULTS Initially, the PRACTICE framework included 48 statements. The content validity of the framework was 0.9. Think-aloud interventions resulted in changes to the number and clarity of statements, along with their position in the framework. The final PRACTICE framework consists of 51 statements and was successfully trialed in a face-to-face training event. CONCLUSIONS The PRACTICE framework is an instrument supported by validation evidence and has been shown to be used effectively. Although the PRACTICE framework was created primarily for pharmacists, validation showed it can also be used for organising training events for other health care professionals. Future organisation and delivery of events according to the framework will continue to provide evidence about use in different settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1966,35483806,"Characterization of doctor of pharmacy/health informatics dual degrees in the United States. INTRODUCTION Health care is trending towards an increasing reliance on data management, technology, analytics, and automation which is also reflected in pharmacy education. This study aimed to identify and characterize doctor of pharmacy (PharmD)/master of science in health informatics (MSHI) dual-degree offerings at pharmacy institutions within the United States (US). METHODS A list of PharmD/MSHI programs was obtained from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy and the Pharmacy College Application Service. Furthermore, websites of the 143 accredited schools and colleges of pharmacy in the US were inspected to identify additional PharmD/MSHI dual degrees not identified with the previous sources and to verify that the dual degree was being actively offered at each institution. A 26-item questionnaire focusing on program structure, admissions, and output was developed and administered to program representatives via phone interview. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS Thirteen schools offering a PharmD/MSHI dual degree were identified, of which 10 participated (response rate = 77%). All programs were created within the last 10 years. Programs were similar in terms of admission requirements such as grade point average thresholds and standardized testing. Variances existed in program structure and output, such as accreditation status and number of enrollees/graduates. CONCLUSIONS Although health informatics has become more prominent in health care, health informatics education is not yet as pervasive in the pharmacy field.

1967,35483807,"Prevalence of phubbing by student pharmacists at two colleges of pharmacy. INTRODUCTION Problematic smartphone use has been associated with numerous factors of mental health including depression, stress, and anxiety. Most of the research in this area has focused on the effects to the smartphone user. One relatively new phenomenon in this area of research is phone snubbing (""phubbing"") and its effect on others. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the prevalence of phubbing behavior among a group of student pharmacists. METHODS The validated Generic Scale of Phubbing (GSP) was administered to a convenience sample of student pharmacists at two different doctor of pharmacy programs. The scale is scored from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of phubbing behavior. RESULTS Of 555 eligible students, 262 (47.2%) responded to the survey. Scores were similar to, but lower than, scores from other studies. Institution was a significant factor in predicting GSP score. Gender and age group, when taking into account institution, were not significant predictors of GSP scores. Overall, the data in our study showed good internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha for the combined group of 0.86.

1968,35483808,"Utilizing an optional cumulative examination in a skills-based lab course series to assess student performance and knowledge retention. INTRODUCTION In the doctor of pharmacy curriculum, students are subjected to scenarios where success is contingent upon accurate retention of information learned during class. To provide incentive to students and simultaneously gauge student retention of course material, an optional honors examination was created for a skills laboratory course. The objectives of this research were to determine student pharmacist performance on the examination and to assess student pharmacist interest and motivation for taking (or not taking) the optional examination. METHODS An optional comprehensive honors examination was implemented simultaneously within a laboratory course series. Student performance was analyzed across cohorts and students were given a web-based survey prior to the examination to gauge initial interest and engagement. A second survey was conducted after the examination to identify motivation for taking the optional examination. Surveys were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS There were 238 responses to the initial survey (47%) and 183 (96%) responses to the post-examination survey. Common topics of motivation for taking the examination included enhancing transcripts, gauging their own retention, and assessing readiness for experiential activities. One hundred sixty-one students participated in the optional examination, and 65 achieved a score of 90% and the honors designation. The majority (96%) of students who chose to take the examination thought the activity was valuable to their education.

1969,35483809,"Assessment of the impact of co-curricular activities on achievement of Doctor of Pharmacy program outcomes. INTRODUCTION Co-curricular activities are recognized as an increasingly important aspect of pharmacy education. However, the impact of these activities on student learning is not well understood compared to that of curricular learning. The purpose of this study was to assess student-perceived progress in achieving program outcomes through voluntary co-curricular activities compared with learning of the same outcomes through mandatory curricular activities. METHODS The study was performed over six semesters between fall 2017 and spring 2020 at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. Separate surveys were sent to all first- through third-year doctor of pharmacy students each semester to assess the impact of curricular and co-curricular activities on improvement in six program outcomes. Graduating student survey data were also mapped to learning outcomes to assess improvement of these outcomes upon graduation. RESULTS Three main results emerged from these data. First, there was greater variation in the impact of co-curricular activities on different learning outcomes compared to the effect of curricular activities on the same outcomes. Second, co-curricular activities had a greater impact on ""soft skills,"" including leadership and professionalism, compared to concrete knowledge in areas such as therapeutic mechanisms. Finally, the impact of co-curricular activities on most learning outcomes diminished with progression through the curriculum while the impact of curricular activities remained relatively constant. CONCLUSIONS Student-perceived improvement in learning of program outcomes differs when based on co-curricular compared to curricular activities.

INTRODUCTION This study aimed to determine whether a brief educational intervention for student pharmacists about individuals who exhibit suicide warning signs improves knowledge and confidence to recognize suicide warning signs, ask about suicide, validate feelings, and expedite referrals. METHODS This longitudinal, observational study was conducted with student pharmacists from two pharmacy schools in 2019. Students completed a suicide prevention module adapted from the Veteran Administration's S.A.V.E. suicide prevention gatekeeper training program (completion rate 67%). The module included a video case of an individual who exhibits suicide warning signs, a brief didactic lecture, and a role-play practice session. Text responses were coded by three independent raters. Students completed a multiple-choice pretest and posttest to assess knowledge and confidence. Paired samples t-tests were calculated to examine changes in students' knowledge and confidence scores. RESULTS Students' (N = 139) confidence and knowledge in recognizing and managing suicide warning signs improved significantly. There was improvement in how many students directly asked about suicide and expedited a referral. Most students (86%) reported planning to incorporate what they learned into practice. CONCLUSIONS In two schools of pharmacy, a brief suicide prevention module was implemented and adapted to the community pharmacy setting, which improved pharmacy students' knowledge and confidence to interact with an individual who exhibits suicide warning signs. S.A.V.E. teaches students how to communicate with an individual in crisis in a way that can be integrated into a busy pharmacy workflow, which may be why students planned to incorporate it into practice.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION The objective of this manuscript is to outline the process involved in the development and validation of a survey that is optimal for assessing the impact of a substance use disorder (SUD) elective course. METHODS Face validation was performed once the initial survey was developed. Additionally, field validation was performed by surveying a small population of pharmacy students enrolled in the elective course. Non-parametric chi-square test and factor analysis were performed to analyze survey results and measure survey validity, while Cronbach alpha (CA) was performed to measure reliability. RESULTS Student survey responses showed a significance of P < .05 using one sample chi-square test for statements 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 15. Factor analysis identified five factors; however, only three factors were identified as having good correlation. Factor 1 related to students' beliefs about patients with SUD, factor 2 related to attitudes about patients with SUD, and factor 3 related to beliefs about SUD. Factors 1, 2, and 3 have a calculated CA > 0.7, indicating strong internal consistency and reliability.

1972,35483813,"Impact of COVID-19 health information sources on student vaccine hesitancy. BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to determine how health care professional and undergraduate students stay informed on COVID-19 and which characteristics influence the decision to receive or recommend a vaccine to focus efforts on addressing misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. METHODS A 13-item survey was administered to currently enrolled undergraduate and health care students (including nursing, dental, medical, and pharmacy) within the same university. Students were asked to rate their utilization and trust of COVID-19 resources and were asked about the importance and challenges of staying current with COVID-19 information. Student willingness to receive the vaccine was also assessed. RESULTS The school of pharmacy had the highest percentage of students (88.3%, n = 159) who would receive the vaccine. Only 73.6% (n = 323) of undergraduate students reported they would be willing. Students who were willing to receive the vaccine had higher average scores of trust for scientific journals, school curriculum/coursework, and school communication and utilized these sources for COVID-19 information more than those who would not receive the vaccine and were unsure about receiving the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms that students who were most trusting of their COVID-19 information sources were more likely to receive the vaccine. Pharmacy students relied heavily on information provided by the school curriculum/coursework, indicating the need for pharmacy faculty to include methods of addressing vaccine hesitancy such as simulation modules and the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process to help students combat vaccine hesitancy and misinformation when communicating with patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1973,35483814,"COVID-19 vaccine status and hesitancy in pharmacy students. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this research is to determine pharmacy students' immunization status and attitudes towards receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. It will help determine if education is needed to increase the vaccination rate and, if so, what areas to target. The study will also provide insight into vaccine hesitancy among pharmacy students. METHODS In April 2021, a survey was sent to pharmacy students in professional years 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusetts. Information gathered included if the student had received and completed the vaccine series, why the student was motivated to receive the vaccine, or why they were hesitant, along with work and experiential rotation information. RESULTS The response rate to the survey was 63% (133 of 212). Eighty-six percent of the respondents were at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19. Four percent of respondents were not considering receiving the vaccine, 6% were, and another 4% were undecided. Unvaccinated students attributed their hesitancy mostly to being concerned about the vaccine's long-term effects (85%) followed by not wanting to miss an exam/class (23%). Vaccinated students were more likely to work at a site that administered the COVID-19 vaccine (81.6% vs. 50%, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS Despite the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccination rates were not higher than voluntary influenza vaccination rates. This study indicates that despite pharmacy students being witness to the risks associated with the pathogen, additional education is needed, and health care providers are not immune to misinformation and hesitancy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigator-designed survey was comprised of 22 items inquiring about spirituality and SC as well as several items assessing demographic and religious characteristics. RESULTS Participants included 470 student pharmacists (87.2% response rate) who were 28.9 ± 5.7 years old on average. Half of the respondents (50.5%) attended the non-religiously affiliated university. Most of the respondents were female (67%), Christian (67.8%), spiritual (79.2%), and religious (75.2%). They ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that: ""understanding patients' spiritual beliefs is an important part of pharmacy practice"" (83%), ""I would pray with my patients as a pharmacist"" (54.8%), ""it is appropriate for a pharmacist to have spiritual or religious conversations with patients"" (52.9%), and ""it is appropriate for a pharmacist to pray with and for patients who request it"" (66.9%). These beliefs were positively correlated with self-reported religiosity and spirituality. CONCLUSIONS Most students considered themselves spiritual and religious and felt that spirituality and learning about SC were important. The respondents' SC perspectives were associated with their religiosity and spirituality.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1975,35483816,"The use of ratio and proportion, dimensional analysis, and equations to solve pharmacy calculations problems. INTRODUCTION To evaluate the effects of using different problem-solving approaches on the success rates of student pharmacists in solving problems throughout a pharmacy calculations course. METHODS A survey was administered to first-year students (N = 96, response rate 100%) near the completion of a pharmacy calculations course. The survey assessed whether students used the approaches of ratio and proportion (RP) or equations vs. dimensional analysis (DA) to solve calculation problems involving conversions, weight-based doses, flow rates, electrolyte solutions, and expressions of concentration. Questions used on course exams were tagged according to topics. Mean success rates in solving tagged questions were correlated with the problem-solving approaches that students used. RESULTS Approximately 60% of students used RP/equations, 30% used DA, and 10% used both approaches equally. The success rate of students solving conversions was 74% ± 24% for RP, 84% ± 14% for DA (P < .05 vs. RP), and 91% ± 12% for the use of both approaches equally (P < .05 vs. RP). Success rates in solving calculation problems of weight-based doses, flow rates, electrolyte solutions, and expressions of concentration were similar across all approaches. CONCLUSIONS The use of DA, or the combination of RP and DA equally, may be advantageous for solving conversions but not for the other types of calculation problems studied. Therefore, for most topics, pharmacy calculations instructors can demonstrate the method of their choice. Since a considerable number of students use each of the approaches, the demonstration of both approaches in class may be advantageous.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1976,35483817,"Revisiting the Socratic method of teaching to improve third-year pharmacy students critical thinking and advanced pharmacy practice experience readiness in a critical care elective. BACKGROUND One of the most important abilities we look to nurture and develop in pharmacy students is critical thinking. A critical care elective course was re-designed to optimize high-pressure situations to engage and target critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) readiness using the Socratic method of teaching. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY Pharmacy students at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy were selected and exposed to a high-pressure classroom environment with each day structured around the Socratic method of teaching. Pass/fail grades were earned daily based solely on verbal responses and discussions. The assessment tools used were: Health Sciences and Reasoning Test (HSRT) to measure critical thinking, an APPE-readiness survey of the entire third-year class for peer comparison, and a survey of the style and pedagogies used. CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY The elective students showed noteworthy gains on their HSRT results in an eight-week critical care elective course. They also had significantly more positive responses on the APPE-readiness survey relative to their classmates and rated this teaching style higher than a typical course. Revisiting and applying the Socratic method of teaching in a high-pressure course is an effective way to engage pharmacy students, producing substantial improvements in critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and APPE readiness in a short time. Lastly, it offers one way to incorporate a validated tool to measure critical thinking in pharmacy students for institutional assessment and accreditation that is widely available, easy to use, and cost friendly.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1977,35483818,"Training student pharmacists to administer pediatric immunizations. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To describe the implementation of a pediatric vaccination training for student pharmacists and to assess student confidence in providing pediatric vaccinations after taking part in a mixed media, traditional lecture, and active learning, formatted training course. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Student pharmacists were trained with a two-hour pediatric immunization training module which consisted of materials to detail administration techniques. Students were assessed using a live skills assessment and a multiple-choice knowledge examination. To assess student confidence in these skills, the students were given a pre- and post-instruction survey which was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. FINDINGS All 170 students enrolled successfully completed the knowledge assessment with an average score of 87% (SD 10%). The skills assessment items most commonly needing remediation were verifying that caregivers received the Vaccine Information Sheet (24%) and reviewing comfort measures and after care instructions with the caregiver (24%). The pre-course survey was completed by 169 out of 170 student pharmacists (99.4%) while the post-course survey was completed by 164 student pharmacists (96.4%) with each item showing a statistically significant increase in perceived confidence in vaccine administration. SUMMARY Pediatric vaccination training was integrated into a doctor of pharmacy curriculum with the goals of increasing student knowledge and confidence in giving pediatric immunizations. Upon course completion, there was a statistically significant increase in student-perceived knowledge and confidence when administering pediatric immunizations. By expanding access to pediatric immunizers, pharmacists can aid in increasing immunization rates improving public health in their communities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1978,35483819,"A classroom-based patient case activity as a potential formative indicator of pre-advanced pharmacy practice experience readiness. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Pharmacy programs must assess student readiness for advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). This study evaluated: (1) if a relationship exists between student performance on a classroom-based patient case activity (Rx Review) and (2) performance on direct patient care and perceptions of the transferability of Rx Reviews to the APPE setting. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Rx Reviews are timed, independent, prospective reviews of a patient's medical record intended to simulate pre-rounding activities common in acute and ambulatory care settings. Students complete 12 Rx Reviews across a skills laboratory course sequence. Rx Review scores were compared to performance on acute care and ambulatory care APPEs for students in the Class of 2019 using descriptive statistics for student scores and bivariate logistic regression for the association between Rx Review scores and performance outcomes on patient care APPEs. Student perceptions of the Rx Reviews were assessed through a survey. Descriptive statistics and qualitative responses were used to analyze responses to the multiple-choice survey questions and open-ended question, respectively. FINDINGS One hundred twenty-two students participated in the study. A relationship was found between students' Rx Review scores and performance in certain direct patient care APPEs, with students performing in the bottom 50% on Rx Reviews being more likely to perform poorly on those APPEs. Over 93% of students identified Rx Reviews as at least somewhat helpful in preparing them for APPEs.

1979,35483820,"Virtual accreditation visits for pharmacy programs in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: Team members' perspective. PURPOSE This wisdom of experience commentary, from peer academic reviewers serving on accreditation teams, will discuss benefits and challenges of international and national virtual accreditation visits (VAVs) using a ""What? So What? Now What?"" reflective model. DESCRIPTION Onsite accreditation reviews for health professional education programs require investments in time, effort, and money to maintain program alignment with accreditation standards and continuously generate quality practitioners. When COVID-19 entered the accreditation world, reviewers had to pivot modalities to a VAV format. ANALYSIS/INTERPRETATION Adaptation and expectations of VAVs present several challenges. Barriers and advantages will be discussed as well as implications for the future. While medical and pharmacy education standardization has long been established, the authors propose national and international accrediting bodies will utilize the ingenuity of emergency COVID-19-driven onsite accreditation alternatives to develop protocols for novel accreditation methodology. CONCLUSIONS Whether the continued mutation of COVID-19 prevents the return to previous accreditation visits or not, the experiences gained from the emergency-driven VAV, can inform and enrich accrediting bodies knowledge, theories, and practices of future VAVs. IMPLICATIONS Higher-education institutions, accreditation bodies, and government entities will use experiences during COVID-19 to transform and improve academic requirements and future practices. Even if there is a full return to onsite reviews, such guidelines or improved versions of them can be applied to situations where immobility or restricted mobility is an issue, such as in illness, pregnancy, travel, war, etc. It is crucial for educators and accrediting bodies to evolve as we navigate these unprecedented times.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1980,35483821,"Course design, delivery, and assessment strategies for pharmaceutical calculations course in a doctor of pharmacy program: A review. BACKGROUND Pharmaceutical calculations is a fundamental course taken by doctor of pharmacy students in United States schools and colleges of pharmacy. To minimize medical errors and increase the accuracy with which future pharmacists perform calculations, a comprehensive training during the program is deemed. This review attempts to summarize research outcomes of interventions described thus far in the literature concerning the improvement of course design, delivery, and assessment strategies. METHODS A detailed literature review of various educational resources was conducted using pharmaceutical calculations and related terms. RESULTS The literature review outcomes were divided into three major categories: educational interventions in design, delivery, and assessment of pharmaceutical calculations courses. The research findings of course design describe a standalone course vs. an integrated course, a computer-aided course, use of compact disc read-only memory, and implementation of Gagne's Nine Events of Instructions. Findings in course delivery include the use of self-paced vs. integrated courses, flipped classroom vs. traditional lecture, Keller's Personalized System of Instruction, condensed videos, and podcasts. Finally, different types of assessments are presented such as those based on selected- vs. constructed-response questions, collaborative quizzes, the approach of repeated testing, and the use of technology. IMPLICATIONS While the review intends to present educational interventions available to construct and/or modify an existing pharmaceutical calculations course, the choice of design, delivery, and assessment approaches depends upon various factors such as the purpose of course modification, resources available, and the number of students in class.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1981,35483822,"Fostering empathy and self-efficacy in pharmacy students through service learning. BACKGROUND Pharmacy student proficiency in direct patient interactions is an integral component of the doctor of pharmacy curriculum. Service-learning experiences offer pharmacy students valuable opportunities to develop self-efficacy and empathy while serving communities with unmet needs. The objective of this review is to evaluate the impact of service-learning experiences on the self-efficacy and empathy of pharmacy and other health professions students. METHODS A narrative literature review was conducted using PubMed, ERIC, and CINAHL databases. Articles were included if they described the relationship between any health professions student service-learning experience and changes in self-efficacy and empathy. Articles were excluded if they involved simulation experiences, standardized patients, or international experiences. RESULTS A total of 11 relevant articles were identified, seven examined changes in student self-efficacy and six assessed student empathy. Articles included students representing seven health professions, with one eligible article in pharmacy. All articles investigating self-efficacy reported a positive impact of service learning on student confidence. Most articles focusing on empathy found that service learning had a positive impact on student empathy, and only one article noted a negative trend. Students with limited prior direct patient care experience had the greatest improvement in clinical confidence and empathy. IMPLICATIONS This review adds a new perspective to the literature by evaluating evidence-based service-learning models in pharmacy education. Offering additional structured service-learning opportunities for pharmacy students fosters self-efficacy and empathy while supporting communities with unmet needs. Future studies evaluating innovative service-learning models and methods of continuous assessment within the pharmacy curriculum are warranted.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1982,35483826,"An Update on the Progress Toward Gender Equity in US Academic Pharmacy.  Objective. To evaluate the status of gender equity in US pharmacy education since the two previous publications in 2004 and 2014.Methods. Data were gathered from existing national databases, internal American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) databases, AACP meeting minutes, published reports, scholarly articles, pharmacy association websites, individual school websites, and LinkedIn profiles. Differences between men and women were evaluated on degree completion, discipline, rank, tenure status, research, leadership development, leadership positions, salaries, and professional awards. Comparisons were also made to academic medicine and dentistry.Results. There are 51% female full-time faculty members across all academic pharmacy disciplines. The number of women at the rank of professor is 36.6% compared to 25% in 2014. Of the 2,992 tenured or tenure track pharmacy faculty, 39.2% are women. Out of 388 department chairs, 146 are women. Throughout 2014-2021, there were 121 CEO Dean permanent appointments with 91 men (75.2%) and 30 women (24.8%). Women received 29.7% of the National Institutes of Health grants awarded to pharmacy schools compared to men (70.3%), although women's funding amount was higher. In both the pharmacy practice discipline and all sciences disciplines, the total salary across all ranks and years in rank was significantly higher for men than women, as well as for department chairs, but there were no differences for CEO Deans. To date, women have received 13% of four national pharmacy organizations' top 13 awards.Conclusion. Since 2014, some achievement gaps have narrowed but areas of concern still exist and need continued attention and resources so inequities can be eliminated. Women in academic pharmacy need mentoring and support to extend throughout the trajectory of their careers in areas such as academic advancement, grant applications, salary negotiation, leadership pursuit, and award applications.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1983,35484711,"Implementation of a Pharmacist-Led, Multidisciplinary Naloxone Patient Education Program at an Academic Medical Center.  Background: Opioid related overdoses are a leading cause of death in the United States (U.S). National, state and local initiatives have been implemented to combat the opioid crisis. However, there is a paucity of initiatives that examine the role of comprehensive naloxone education interventions for hospitalized patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to design a multidisciplinary, pharmacist-driven, standardized, patient and product tailored, inpatient naloxone education program (NEP) at a U.S. academic medical center, targeting patients at high risk of opioid overdose, and to examine patients' retention of education. Methods: This prospective pilot study targeted hospitalized patients who were considered at high-risk for opioid overdose once discharged. Using daily screening methods and established inclusion criteria, we evaluated the impact of implementing a patient-tailored NEP. The primary outcome measures were patient knowledge and awareness of naloxone use. A paired t-test analysis was conducted to assess for improvement in patient naloxone awareness and knowledge. Results: Of ninety-five patients screened, forty-four patients met inclusion criteria and nineteen patients completed naloxone education along with pre- and post-assessments. Patients more accurately completed the assessment, indicating enhanced knowledge about naloxone use and administration, following the naloxone education (4.68 ± .13 vs 3.42 ± .31 out of 5 questions, mean ± SEM; P = .0016).

1984,35484867,"Pharmacoeconomic, Medication Access, and Patient-Satisfaction Analysis of a Pharmacist-Managed VTE Clinic Compared to Primary Care Physician Outpatient Therapy.  Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common medical condition often treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Current literature supports outpatient treatment of select, low-risk VTE patients by a pharmacist with DOACs; however, no studies exist to demonstrate if a pharmacist-managed VTE clinic provides financial benefit compared to physician-managed outpatient care. To compare the financial implications and patient satisfaction of pharmacist-managed VTE care versus outpatient VTE care by a primary care physician. A single-center retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients seen at a pharmacist-managed VTE clinic for safety and reimbursement outcomes between August 1, 2018 and July 31, 2019. These data points were used to assess the primary endpoint of net gain per patient visit and secondary outcomes, including patient satisfaction score. The primary outcome median (IQR) for net gain per visit was $16.57 (16.57, 16.57) for the pharmacist-managed group and $64.37 (47.04, 64.37) in the physician-managed group with a 95% CI of 39.13-47.80.

1985,35484869,"The Use of Prothrombin Complex Concentrates: Results of a Nationwide Survey of Critical Care Pharmacists. BACKGROUND Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are frequently used. OBJECTIVE To elucidate practices and perceptions of proprietary and nonproprietary PCCs use. METHODS An electronic pretested cross-sectional survey e-mailed thrice to 1 critical care pharmacist at 1170 US institutions. Questions addressed hospital and pharmacy characteristics, use of PCCs, and perceptions of effectiveness and safety. RESULTS 429 (39.5%) of 1086 eligible institutions completed the questionnaire. PCCs were used several times per month to several times per week (62.6%). An order set was routinely or always used to direct PCCs usage at 66.4% of institutions. Four-factor PCCs were preferred by 93% of institutions. The most common perceived indications for 4-factor PCCs were hemorrhage related to warfarin (92.1%) or oral Xa inhibitors (81.8%), intracranial hemorrhage (78.4%), trauma hemorrhage (66.2%), surgical hemorrhage (61.1%), and refractory hemorrhage (57.3%). The most common perceived contraindications were heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (42%), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (39.2%), and active thromboembolism (38.9%). Most institutions considered patient weight (78.8%), indication (77.6%), and International Normalized Ratio (76.9%) when dosing PCCs. Only 43.8% of institutions used fixed dose, only 19.6% compounded PCCs at the bedside, and only 11.9% administered PCCs by rapid infusion. Compared to standard blood products, respondents believed PCCs acted more rapidly, were less likely to cause volume issues, and were more expensive. Respondents were neutral about PCCs acting longer, being more effective at preventing or treating hemorrhage, or causing thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS Off-label use of PCCs is common.

1986,35484871,"Evaluation of a Pharmacist-Driven Protocol for the Treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation. BACKGROUND Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) treatment guidelines recommend over-the-counter laxatives as first-line therapy, followed by treatment with a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) in refractory patients. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of a pharmacist-driven OIC protocol to promote increased scheduled laxative use prior to escalation to PAMORA therapy. METHODS This retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluated patients 2 years pre- and post-protocol implementation. The primary outcome was the difference in the percentage of patients receiving 2 scheduled laxatives for ≥ 2 days prior to PAMORA therapy pre- and post-protocol. Secondary outcomes included difference in time to first bowel movement after PAMORA initiation, difference in total number of laxative/PAMORA doses administered, and difference in overall estimated total cost. Data was analyzed using chi-squared tests and Student's t tests. RESULTS Three-hundred patients were included (150 patients in the pre and post-protocol groups). In the pre-protocol group, 53 patients (35%) received 2 scheduled laxatives for 2 days prior to naloxegol/methylnaltrexone compared to 96 patients (64%) in the postprotocol group (p < 0.0001). One-thousand twenty-one scheduled laxative doses were given pre-protocol versus 1625 doses post-protocol. Average time to first bowel movement was similar between groups (17.7 hours vs 16.0 hours p = 0.441). Estimated total cost of OIC reversal therapy decreased from $20,896.95 to $13,405.47.

CONTEXT In Quebec, Bill 31, adopted on March 18, 2020, extended vaccination to pharmacists. Despite many advantages, this new practice comes with public health issues reinforced in the context of COVID-19. Therefore, it is essential to understand the opportunities and challenges of the participation of community pharmacists in influenza vaccination, from a public health perspective by (i) describing the year of 2020-2021 influenza vaccination offer, (ii) its opportunities and challenges, and (iii) its impact on the accessibility of this service newly offered by pharmacists to the most vulnerable people. METHODS This research is a case study from one of the most affected areas by COVID-19 in Canada: Laval. Our method combines documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with health professionals and public health actors (n = 23). Researchers used a thematic analysis to analyze these results. RESULTS Most partners (pharmacists, public health administrators) underlined multiple opportunities of this new practice, ie, pharmacists who can vaccinate, particularly for chronically ill patients. However, structural and strategical challenges remain. More specifically, vaccination seemed to only rely on a ""first come, first served"" basis, which questions public health objectives of vaccination, such as equitable access. CONCLUSION The introduction of new actors, such as pharmacists, represents a major opportunity to improve vaccination coverage and reduce the burden of COVID-19 on the health system.

1991,35487821,"State Laws and Generic Substitution in the Year After New Generic Competition. OBJECTIVES Substitution of brand-name drugs with less expensive, equally effective interchangeable generics is an important strategy for promoting adherence and controlling prescription drug spending. US state laws govern generic substitution, but there is variability among states in how these laws are designed. We aimed to determine how different features of state laws regulating generic substitution are associated with use of generic drugs. METHODS Using national claims databases, we studied individuals with commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage plans who newly initiated one of 34 prescription drugs during the year after new generic competition (2017-2018) to determine any association between generic use and 3 different features of state laws. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS Of 502 763 individuals who initiated one of the drugs, 409 856 (81.6%) received a generic version. Those in states requiring patient consent or notification had lower use of generics (81.1% vs 82.9%; adjusted odds ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.91; P < .001). By contrast, mandating versus permitting generic substitution and protecting pharmacists from liability did not appear to have significant effects. CONCLUSIONS In this study of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients, patients in states requiring consent or notification for pharmacists to substitute Food and Drug Administration-certified interchangeable generics had lower use of generics.

1992,35487878,"An Examination of Student Pharmacists' Perceptions Toward Immunization.  Introduction: Pharmacists are considered the most accessible health care professionals, especially when it comes to preventative services such as immunizations. Studies have assessed student knowledge and comfort in administering vaccinations immediately after receiving formal training or completing a vaccination clinic experience; however, few have examined students after applying the knowledge to a pharmacy work experience. A survey of student pharmacists regarding these experiences may identify areas that students are less confident in and thus where immunization training could be improved. Methods: A non-validated survey was created in Google Forms and distributed via email from November through December of 2019. The survey was sent to student pharmacists enrolled in one doctor of pharmacy program at a US institution in Western New York who had completed immunization training almost one year prior to the survey. Results: The survey was distributed to 365 student pharmacists. A total of 189 students (51.8%) completed the survey. Student perceptions of providing immunizations were positive overall, with 173 students (91.5%) responding that they agreed or strongly agreed to feeling confident administering intramuscular injections. In contrast, only 110 students (58.2%) agreed or strongly agreed to feeling confident administering subcutaneous injections. Also, 111 students (58.7%) indicated they had not administered an immunization in the 9 months after they had completed their immunization training. Conclusions: Based on this cohort, perceptions are positive overall; however, there is room for continued improvement in training pharmacy students for immunization proficiency as well as increasing the cooperation of pharmacies to allow students to immunize.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1993,35488266,"Microcredentials training in pharmacy practice and education: an exploratory study of its viability and pharmacists' professional needs. BACKGROUND Microcredentials (MCs) are short courses that certify/recognise an individual's achievement of specific skills or knowledge. Schools of pharmacy could be well-placed to contribute to the continuing professional development (CPD) of pharmacists through the inclusion of MCs training in their programs. This study aimed to explore pharmacy professionals' views on the need and viability of MC courses globally. METHODS Eleven semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with pharmacy practitioners, policymakers, and academics across seven countries. The participants were selected using purposive sampling to explore information from varying pharmacy disciplines. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS Participants regarded MCs in pharmacy as an innovative idea, well-suited to the increasingly technology-driven world. They believe MCs provide easily accessible means of skills and knowledge acquisition that fulfils the needs of the pharmacy profession. MCs were also perceived as an alternative pathway of meeting the requirements of traditional CPD programmes. Many participants believe universities are well-suited to provide MCs; however, numerous challenges such as recognition, time and resources have been identified as potential barriers to enrolment and implementation. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an insight into the views of pharmacy practitioners and academics on MCs, and their potential utility in pharmacy education and practice. The findings should help in the development of MCs that could be utilised by pharmacy practitioners around the world for CPD purposes.

1994,35488847,"In vivo exposure-response relationship of meropenem against metallo-β-lactamase-harbouring Pseudomonas aeruginosa: an assessment using MICs from conventional and zinc-limited broth. OBJECTIVES Previous investigations into metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-harbouring Enterobacterales suggest that susceptibility testing in zinc-limited media may be more appropriate in predicting β-lactam in vivo activity. There are limited data with MBL-harbouring Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS Forty-three MBL-harbouring P. aeruginosa isolates (IMP, n = 11; VIM, n = 12; NDM, n = 10; SPM, n = 10) and two P. aeruginosa control isolates (KPC, n = 1; WT, n = 1) were evaluated. Meropenem activity was evaluated in the murine neutropenic thigh model using humanized exposures. Susceptibility testing was conducted in conventional CAMHB, EDTA-supplemented CAMHB (3-300 mg/L EDTA) and Chelex-treated CAMHB (0-1.0 mg/L re-supplemented zinc), resulting in a range of meropenem MIC values for each isolate. A sigmoidal Emax model was fitted to fT>MIC versus change in log10 cfu/thigh to estimate the goodness of fit (R2). RESULTS Increasing EDTA concentrations or limiting the amount of zinc in broth resulted in several-fold reductions in MIC among the majority of the MBL-harbouring P. aeruginosa while the MICs for the KPC and WT isolates were unchanged. Bacterial killing in vivo was variable, with the range of killing spanning -3.29 to +4.81 log10 change in cfu/thigh. Addition of 30 mg/L EDTA and Chelex-treated CAMHB (with no zinc supplementation) provided broth conditions for susceptibility testing that best predicted in vivo efficacy (R2 > 0.7). CONCLUSIONS Among MBL-harbouring P. aeruginosa, meropenem in vivo efficacy is best represented by the pharmacodynamic profile generated using MICs determined in EDTA-supplemented or zinc-limited broth. In addition to previous data with Enterobacterales, antibiotic susceptibility testing in media that approximates physiological conditions makes it possible to uncover potential and existing therapeutic agents.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1995,35490088,"The role of the clinical pharmacist in mental health hospital-in-the-home: A scoping review. BACKGROUND The concept of integrating a clinical pharmacist (CP) within a Hospital-in-the-Home (HiTH) program is relatively new. Little is known about the role of a pharmacist in HiTH programs focused on mental health (MH). OBJECTIVES To describe the role of a CP within an MH-HiTH program, focusing on the specific tasks performed by a pharmacist in this position, their benefits and limitations. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched without any date limits for references in English that included 2 or more of the following key terms (or their synonyms): ""HiTH"", ""clinical pharmacist"" and ""mental health"". Two reviewers independently screened and analysed the data. RESULTS Of 60,482 screened references, 6 included all 3 key terms: 2 were HiTH guideline documents, 2 were conference abstracts and 2 were journal articles. These papers discussed MH-HiTH programs or similar home-care services where a CP was incorporated in the treating team to address medication management and adherence during a home visit. There is evidence that MH-HiTH CPs identify and resolve medication-related problems (MRPs), as well as improve medication adherence, patient care, hospital admission rates and emergency department presentations. An additional 54 references including 2 key terms provided corroborating evidence of an MH-HiTH CP role focused on improving patient care via 4 key groups of tasks: clinical pharmacy, mental healthcare, home medicines review and facilitation of care transition through medication reconciliation and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Although there is currently a paucity of literature describing the incorporation of a CP in an MH-HiTH program, preliminary evidence shows it can improve medication management. This has potential to improve patient outcomes as has been seen in similar home-based settings, but limitations such as time constraints are notable barriers. More robust studies are needed to evaluate these outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1996,35490092,"Enhancing Diabetes Surveillance Across Alberta by Adding Laboratory and Pharmacy Data to the National Diabetes Surveillance System Methods. OBJECTIVES The National Diabetes Surveillance System (NDSS) case definition, which identifies a case of diabetes using administrative health records as ""two physician claims or one hospital discharge abstract record, within a 2-year period for a diagnosis bearing International Classification of Disease codes for diabetes"", was compared with expanded case definitions, including pharmacy (PHARM) and laboratory (LAB) data. The PHARM definition included any therapeutic anti-hyperglycemic agents, and the LAB definition included thresholds of ≥1 glycated hemoglobin measurement of ≥6.5%, or 2 instances of random glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L or fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L. METHODS In this retrospective study we used administrative data from the Diabetes Infrastructure for Surveillance, Evaluation, and Research project. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize participants by several subgroups. RESULTS The NDSS identified 291,242 diabetes cases, indicating a provincial prevalence of 6.83%. Using LAB plus PHARM identified 52,040 additional cases, so the combination of NDSS or LAB or PHARM identified the largest number of cases (n=343,282), increasing the diabetes prevalence estimate to 8.06%. These 3 sources resulted in 7 unique subsets: NDSS only (n=42,606), PHARM only (n=16,310), LAB only (n=32,202), NDSS+LAB (n=32,582), NDSS+PHARM (n=22,503), LAB+PHARM (n=3,528) and NDSS+LAB+PHARM (n=193,551). Refinement using demographic and clinical characteristics allowed presumptive cases of polycystic ovarian syndrome to be excluded. CONCLUSIONS The widely used NDSS case definition can be enhanced by the addition of LAB and PHARM data. Including PHARM and LAB data identified subsets of the diabetes population, which can maximize the yield for detection of diabetes cases in Alberta and provide a richer understanding of this population to target interventions to improve health outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1997,35490096,"Surveying the persistence of age- and gender-based restrictions on over-the-counter emergency contraception across pharmacies in Los Angeles County, CA. BACKGROUND Over-the-counter levonorgestrel emergency contraception (OTC EC) is safe and effective but underutilized for postcoital pregnancy prevention. Unnecessary restrictions imposed by pharmacies and pharmacy workers may impede EC uptake. OBJECTIVE To assess the persistence of age- and gender-based barriers to OTC EC access among pharmacists and pharmacy staff across Los Angeles, CA. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey of registered community pharmacies randomly chosen from regions with the highest unintended pregnancy rates in Los Angeles County. Using an adaptation of the 2017 American Society for Emergency Contraception EC Access and Price Survey, we interviewed pharmacy staff about their attitudes and practices related to OTC EC, with attention to age- and gender-based barriers. RESULTS We surveyed 139 staff members (45% pharmacists, 20% technicians, 26% retail) from 93 publicly accessible pharmacies. Thirteen pharmacies did not stock EC. Half of respondents cited age-based restrictions; only 4% noted gender-based restrictions. More than 75% reported being asked for EC by a man; 7% reported refusing to sell to a man. Nearly 40% reported that men never or rarely purchased EC. Pharmacists were more likely than technicians or retail staff to believe men rarely purchased EC (P = 0.01). The most frequently cited concern about selling to men was inability to confirm the female partner's age. CONCLUSION Although gender-based restrictions to EC are rare, more than half of pharmacy staff continue to report age-based restrictions. Inability to verify the female partner's age may underlie cases where men are unable to purchase OTC EC.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
1998,35490592,"Assisted versus referred pharmacy smoking interventions for patients with thoracic malignancies or pulmonary nodules. BACKGROUND Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of death, disease, and disability in the United States. Continued tobacco use in malignant disease contributes to treatment failure and disease progression. Pharmacists are pivotal to tobacco cessation counseling, management, and follow up. METHODS This retrospective, observational, single-center, cohort study of ambulatory cancer patients was designed to assess the impact of assisted versus ""Ask, Advise, Refer"" (AAR) pharmacy-driven smoking cessation interventions on patient-reported quit rates at 30- and 90-days. Those included were currently smoking or recently quit adults with a thoracic malignancy or nodule. Those in the assisted intervention were offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for free according to a personalized quit plan. After July 1, 2020, patients were enrolled in the AAR intervention, whereby participants were referred to obtain NRT through insurance or external resources. Both clinical interventions were provided as standard of care. RESULTS 129 participants were included (assisted n = 83; AAR n = 46) with baseline characteristics evenly matched. After excluding those unable to be reached at 30-days, 30 (44.8%) in the assisted intervention quit smoking versus 11 (27.5%) in the AAR intervention, p = 0.08. Lung cancer patients were more likely to report quitting at 30-days in the assisted intervention, 16 (64.0%) versus 5 (29.4%) in the AAR intervention, p = 0.03. After excluding those unable to be reached at 90-days, 30 (45.5%) in the assisted intervention quit versus 11 (35.5%) in the AAR intervention, p = 0.35.

1999,35491381,"Accessibility of adult immunizations in pharmacies compared to physician offices in low-income communities. BACKGROUND Expanding access to immunization services is essential for improving low-income communities' access to health care. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this analysis was to assess whether adults who live in low-income communities, and adults 65 years old and older who live in low-income communities, have greater access to pharmacies for immunization services than to relevant physician offices. METHODS Databases of the number of physician practices and pharmacy locations were geocoded into ZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs). The ZCTAs where the share of families living at or below the federal poverty threshold exceeded 30% were defined as low-income communities for purposes of the analysis. The raw access comparisons were adjusted to reflect whether physician practices have Medicare Part D billing capability, an access constraint for patients aged 65 years and over, and to reflect the differences in hours of operation. RESULTS There were 15.1% more pharmacy locations within the low-income communities than the availability of physician practices. After adjusting for the hours of operation, the pharmacy locations offered 95.7% more operating hours than the physician practice sites. Compared to the physician practices that have Medicare Part D billing capability, there were 203.0% more pharmacy locations. CONCLUSION Based on the results, lower-income families had greater access to pharmacies than to physician practices, which indicates that pharmacies can play a valuable role in expanding immunization access and could warrant considering policy reforms that enhance the authority of pharmacists to administer vaccinations. State-level potential reforms could include expanding and harmonizing laws governing pharmacist authority to deliver such services, creating health enterprise zones, and granting special tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, or public assistance to encourage the establishment of physician offices and pharmacies in low-income communities.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2000,35493115,"Implementation of IV Push Antibiotics for Outpatients During a National Fluid Shortage Following Hurricane Maria. Background Prior to the introduction of intravenous (IV) drip infusion, most IV drugs were delivered in a syringe bolus push. However, intravenous drip infusions subsequently became the standard of care. Puerto Rico is the largest supplier of IV fluid bags and in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, there was a nationwide fluid bag shortage. This shortage required stewardship measures to maintain the operation of the self-administered outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) program at Parkland Health. Methods Parkland pharmacists evaluated all self-administered antimicrobials for viability of administration as an IV syringe bolus push (IVP) instead of an IV-drip infusion. Medications deemed appropriate were transitioned to IVP. The hospital EMR was used to identify patients discharged to the OPAT clinic using all methods of parenteral drug delivery. Data was collected for patient demographics, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes. Finally cost of care was calculated for IVP and IV drip administration. Results One-hundred and thirteen self-administered IVP and 102 self-administered IV drip treatment courses were identified during the study period. Individuals using IVP had a statistically significant decrease in hospital length of stay. Patient satisfaction was greater with IVP and IVP saved 504 liters of normal saline resulting in a savings of $43,652 over 6 months. The 30-day readmission rate and mortality were similar. Conclusion The abrupt IV fluid shortage following a natural disaster led to implementation of a high value care model that improved efficiency, reduced costs, and did not affect safety or efficacy.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2002,35495384,"Diabetic foot ulcer in Southern Jordan: A cross-sectional Study of Clinical and Microbiological Aspects. Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common metabolic disorder that significantly affects public health. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the serious complications of diabetes. DFU has a wide spectrum of bacterial isolates comprising Gram-positive, Gram-negative, aerobic bacteria and anaerobes. In the last two decades there has been an increase in the multidrug-resistant isolates (MDR). Materials and methods This cross-sectional prospective observational study was conducted in southern Jordan among patients with DFU. The included variables are sociodemographic and clinical information. Isolates from swab culture of ulcers and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern are also recorded. Results A total of 64 diabetic patients with DFU were included in this study. Most patients included in the study were males with male-to-female ratio of (2.2:1). The mean age was 54 years (SD ± 10.7). The mean duration of DM was 16.4 years (SD ± 7.5) and the mean HbA1c was 9.9% (SD ± 2.1). Neuropathy and anemia were noted in 72% and 44% of patients, respectively. The most frequent bacterial isolates were gram negative bacteria accounts for 29 isolates (45.3%). About 37.5% (24) of bacterial isolates showed MDR pattern. Previous antibiotic use in the last 30 days showed significant association with MDR bacteria (p-value <0.05). Previous history of amputations, presence of neuropathy, renal impairment, retinopathy, presence of anemia, limited joint mobility and presence of foot deformity were significantly associated with Wagner's grade ≥ three. Conclusion Many factors affect and increase the risk of having high grade diabetic foot ulcer. The most frequent bacterial isolates from diabetic foot ulcers were gram negative bacteria.

2003,35496268,"Safety of Off-Label Pharmacological Treatment in Pediatric Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Global Perspective From an Observational Study at an Italian Third Level Children's Hospital.  Background: The acquisition of proper and relevant pediatric clinical data is essential to ensure tolerable and effective pediatric drug therapies. In the field of pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, the lack of sufficient high quality scientific evidence for pediatric age results in the frequent need to prescribe off-label drugs. With the aim of improving knowledge about safety profile of off-label drug prescription in children and adolescent with neurological and/or psychiatric disorders, we realized a multidisciplinary pharmacovigilance study. Materials and methods: An observational retrospective study was conducted to assess the safety of off-label pharmacological therapies in patients aged 0-18 years, admitted to the Neuropsychiatry Unit of the Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"" between January 2016 and December 2018. Prescription patterns and adverse drug reactions were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. Results: Overall, 230 patients were enrolled, 48% boys (N = 111), 52% girls (N = 119), average age of 10 years, and a total of 534 prescriptions was analyzed. 54.5% (N = 125) of patients had epilepsy, 37.5% (N = 86) suffered from psychiatric disorders, 8% (N = 19) had other neurological disorders. The prevalence of off-label prescriptions was 32% and 50% of the study population received at least one off-label drug. A total of 106 ADRs was detected: 57% of ADRs were due to drug-drug interactions, 30% were due to off-label prescriptions, 10% were due to overdose and 3% were due to improper use. No significant association between emerged ADRs and off label prescriptions was found (Fisher's exact two-tailed test, p = 1.000). There was significant association between increasing number of administrated drugs and risk of ADRs (OR 1.99; IC95% 1.58-2.5; p = 0.000). Psychiatric disorders were associated with at least three times higher risk to be treated with an off-label drug (OR 3.30; IC95% 2.26-4.83; p = 0.000). Conclusions: This study shows that off-label prescribing in neuropsychiatric disorders does not pose a greater risk of ADRs than on-label prescribing and highlights unmet clinical needs in pediatric neuropsychopharmacology. The multidisciplinary approach can provide important contributions to improve therapeutic path of these already complex pathologies by careful monitoring of therapeutic appropriateness and drug interactions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2004,35496350,"The Efficacy of a Didactic and Case-Based Pharmacogenomics Education Program on Improving the Knowledge and Confidence of Alberta Pharmacists. Background Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of how genetic variations for functional proteins, such as metabolizing enzymes and drug receptors, impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In theory, pharmacists are well suited to utilize PGx in tailoring medications to patient genetics when providing medication therapy management services. However, PGx education needs to reach pharmacists prior to implementation. The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a PGx course for pharmacists. Methods A PGx education program was created and offered synchronously (virtual) and asynchronously (self-study) to pharmacists in Alberta, Canada. Lectures were delivered by experts live (virtual) with a question-and-answer period for synchronous sessions. These sessions were recorded for asynchronous delivery. Six case studies were discussed in large and small groups (""breakout rooms"") in synchronous sessions, and provided for self-study in the asynchronous subgroup. Topics included genetic and PGx concepts; therapeutic applications; ethical, legal, and social considerations; and practical implementation. Pre- and post-course surveys measured self-rated knowledge using a 5-point Likert Scale and tested objective knowledge with a graded quiz. Results Thirty-six pharmacists completed the course and both surveys. Participants reported backgrounds in community (88.9%) and hospital (38.9%) practice. Prior education in PGx was reported by 44.4% from degree programs and 27.8% from continuing education. Overall responses to statements about confidence in PGx moved from a median of ""Disagree"" at baseline to ""Agree"" after receiving PGx education (2-point difference [1,2] on 5-point Likert Scale; p < 0.001), indicating an increase in self-assessed competency in PGx. Likewise, mean participant grades on the knowledge quiz improved (20.8±21.9% pre-course vs 70.2±19.1% post-course, p < 0.001). There was no difference in these results between synchronous and asynchronous groups. Conclusion A didactic and case-based PGx education program was effective at increasing pharmacist knowledge and confidence in PGx in both synchronous and asynchronous environments. Knowledge gained can be utilized in delivery of patient-centered, personalized medication therapy management in the pharmacy setting.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2005,35497892,"Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers towards smoking cessation services among community pharmacists. Introduction With more than one billion current smokers, 80% of them living in low and middle-income countries, tobacco smoking is considered a global public health problem. Jordan has one of the highest estimate rates of tobacco use in the region and world. Still, tobacco use interventions, that could significantly reduce the number of smoking-related diseases and reduce health care costs, are scarce. While such interventions could be carried out by community pharmacists, given their unique position to counsel patients and provide effective cessation interventions, the role of community pharmacists in tobacco control services in Jordan has never been fully investigated. Objective This study aimed at assessing the community pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes, and practice towards smoking cessation and identifying their perceived barriers for smoking cessation counselling utilizing a sample of community pharmacists in Northern Jordan. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacies in Irbid city, North of Jordan, between April and August 2018. A random sample of 95 pharmacies was selected using the multistage random sampling technique. A structured English questionnaire, consisting of 5 parts, was used. The Survey assessed pharmacists' socio-demographics, knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers related to tobacco use cessation services. Results One hundred and fifty pharmacists completed the survey. Their mean age was 30.71±10.10 years. The mean of pharmacists' knowledge score was 3.74±0.38, while their positive and negative attitude were 3.87±0.43 and 3.18±0.66 respectively. Pharmacists' mean smoking cessation practice was 2.01+0.64. Barriers to providing cessation interventions included the lack of training on nicotine replacement therapy products (86%), the lack of smoking cessation programs (84%) and low demands from smokers (83.3%). Conclusion While knowledge related to tobacco use cessation services among the community pharmacists was sub-optimal, a good positive attitude and a low practice levels were observed. The lack of educational materials, low patients' demand, knowledge deficits, low training and the lack of cessation programs have been identified as barriers hindering the provision of smoking cessation services. Furthermore, the study identified factors that will increase community pharmacists' participation in smoking cessation, help in raising pharmacists' awareness of smoking as a public health problem and the importance of their role.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Patients infected with coronavirus have new experiences and hence new needs from the healthcare sector. Acknowledging patients' experiences can exhibit promising outcomes in coronavirus management. Pharmacists are considered a vital pillar in managing patients' experiences during their infection. Objective To assess the experience of individuals who have been infected with coronavirus and the roles played by pharmacists to meet their new needs. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional survey was developed based on previous literature, validated, and conducted in Syria. The survey included items related to participants' COVID-19 experiences, and items concerning the roles played by pharmacists when participants were infected. Items were tested for face validity. Data collection was conducted in May and June 2021. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results The study participants (n=576) had a mean age of 37.99 years. Fatigue was the most reported symptom by the participants. Vitamin C was the most used supplement (76.4%), and 66.5% of the participants used herbs during their infection. More than 60.0% of the participants stated that their anxiety and stress levels increased during their infection. Around 40.0% of the participants needed to visit a specialist doctor. Only 5.4% needed to use an artificial respiration apparatus. The mean of the participants' infection severity was 4.97 (SD=2.30) out of 10. The severity of the infection was significantly affected by being older, female, smoking, and having a chronic condition. Doctors followed by pharmacists were the healthcare providers who advised participants to take certain medications/herbs. More than one-third of the participants strongly agreed/agreed that the pharmacist played important and effective roles during their infection.

2009,35497896,"A cross-sectional study of demonstrating expertise and job satisfaction in pharmacists and dietitians working in community pharmacies in Japan. Background In Japan, there has been a private-sector initiative to register dietitians in pharmacies. There is not yet an adequate amount of data on the attitudes of dietitians in pharmacies regarding their work. Objectives To assess the attitudes of pharmacists and dietitians working in community pharmacies in Japan about their work, and particularly about demonstrating expertise and overall job satisfaction. Methods We administered a web-based questionnaire to pharmacists and dietitians working in pharmacy branches with registered dietitians at two pharmacy chains that agreed to cooperate. We used our own 7-item questionnaire and compared the scores for each item between pharmacists and dietitians. Results A total of 61 persons (22 pharmacists and 39 dietitians) answered the questionnaire. The item with the highest mean score (standard deviation) for pharmacists was ""I feel that I am helpful to patients,"" at 3.50 (0.74), and for dietitians it was ""I have colleagues at my workplace whom I can talk to when I have a problem,"" at 3.51 (1.00). Conversely, the items with the lowest mean score (standard deviation) were ""I am satisfied with my current job"" for pharmacists, at 3.14 (0.83), and ""I can grow sufficiently as a professional"" for dietitians, at 2.41 (0.97). As a result of factor analysis, the seven-item question could be divided into two factors: ""demonstrating expertise"" and ""overall job satisfaction."" The factor-score for ""demonstrating expertise"" was significantly lower for dietitians than for pharmacists (p<0.01), but there was no significant difference in overall job satisfaction between the two professions (p=0.36). Further research is needed to understand why dietitians find ""demonstrating expertise"" difficult in pharmacies. Conclusions The attitudes of pharmacists and dietitians working in pharmacies in Japan toward their jobs were shown to consist of ""demonstration of expertise"" and ""overall job satisfaction.

Methods A total of 86 young thalassemia outpatients at a Thai tertiary care hospital were recruited into the study. Patients were stratified into two groups based on self-assessment of adherence using a visual analogue scale. One group (n=41) was given a calendar with the schedule of drug use in addition to counselling as standard pharmaceutical care. The second group (n=45) only received the counselling. Adherence to iron chelation therapy was assessed by deferiprone pill or deferoxamine vial counts on six visits (V1 to V6) and results were compared between visits and groups using a multilevel linear regression model. Change in serum ferritin levels after 6 visits (n = 81) were compared using a linear regression model. Results Adherence significantly increased in both the calendar and non-calendar groups for deferiprone mono- and combination-therapy and for deferoxamine monotherapy. In the calendar groups, average adherence increased by between 2.05 and 5.66% per visit compared to increases of 0.31 to3.92% per visit in the non-calendar groups. A significant difference in the increase in adherence per visit between the calendar and non-calendar groups was only observed for deferiprone monotherapy (3.03% SEM = 0.49vs 1.42% SEM =0.49, respectively, P-value = 0.0078). The serum ferritin level decreased in the calendar group by 20.25ng/mL (SEM = 23.80) and increased in the non-calendar group by 59.63 ng/mL (SEM = 23.01, P-value = 0.0147). Conclusion Provision of a drug use calendar improved adherence to deferoxamine and deferiprone and decreased serum ferritin levels in young Thai thalassemia patients over the improvements obtained from standard counselling.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2013,35497902,"Prevalence of pharmacist knowledge on beyond-use date (BUD) of various non-sterile compounding drugs in Indonesia. Objective In extemporaneous compounding, drugs' stability is indicated by beyond-use date (BUD), which is different from the expiration date determined by manufacturers, hence, pharmacists are required to provide proper BUD information to patients. A recent study showed that BUD knowledge in the North Jakarta community is low, therefore, this study aims to examine the prevalence of Indonesian pharmacists' BUD knowledge regarding various non-sterile dosage forms. Methods This cross-sectional study involved Indonesian pharmacists' knowledge of serving extemporaneous prescriptions. Recruitment was carried out through the purposive and snow-balling sampling method, while data were obtained by filling out a validated authors' designed questionnaire, with total 34 questions, and collected in September 2021 and then analyzed using the chi-square test. Results Among the 221 total respondents, 93.7% had BUD knowledge, while 12.7% responded that BUD and expiration date are similar. Regarding BUD for crushed tablets, dry syrup without preservatives, and ointment without moisture, there were 13.1%, 82.8%, and 29.4% responded rightly, respectively. Furthermore, there was no correlation between BUD knowledge and respondents' characteristics, including health-care workplace and location, as well as gender, and age with p>0.05. Conclusion Based on the results, the Indonesian pharmacists were considered to have inadequate BUD knowledge, specifically on crushed tablets and ointment, and this might affect drugs' safety.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2014,35497904,"Perspectives of the community in the developing countries toward telemedicine and pharmaceutical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background Pharmaceutical care (PC) services have expanded in recent years, resulting in improved patient outcomes. However, such PC services are currently available for free in the majority of Arabic countries. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine is especially beneficial since it allows for continuity of care while allowing for social distancing and minimizing the risk of infection. Objective To assess the community's attitude, opinion, and willingness to pay for telemedicine and PC services during COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to create a website provision for telemedicine and PC services. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted, over five months (December 2020- April 2021), among the general population in Arabic countries, excluding pharmacists, physicians, and pharmacy students. Results A total of 1717 participants were involved, most of them were from Jordan (52.2%) and Iraq (24.8%). Sixty two percent of participants seek pharmacists' advice whenever they have any medication changes and 45.1% of the participants agreed with the idea of paying pharmacists to decrease medication errors. Interestingly, 89.5% of participants encouraged the idea of creating a website that provides a PC, and 35.5% of them would pay for it. The failure to document the medical information of the patients had most applicants' agreement as a reason of medical errors (M=4.17/5, SD=0.787). More than three-quarters of participants agreed that creating a database containing the patients' medical information will reduce medical errors. Conclusion From a patients' perspective, this study suggests a large patient need for expanding PC services in Arabic countries and introduces a direct estimate of the monetary value for the PC services to contribute to higher savings. The majority of participants supported the idea of creating a website provision of telemedicine and PC services, and a considerable proportion of them agreed to pay for it.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,35497907,"Customers' satisfaction toward drugstore facilities and services based on the good pharmacy practice standard in Thailand. Introduction The Good Pharmacy Practice (GPP) standards in Thailand have been legally implemented for all drugstores since 2014. However, customer satisfaction has not been studied. This research aimed to explore the satisfaction of the customers with the facilities and services received from drugstores under the GPP standards and examine the impact of satisfaction toward each GPP domain on overall satisfaction (OS) and the intention to receive the pharmacy services as the first choice in the case of common and non-serious illnesses (IntR). Methods This research was a cross-sectional survey study. The Google Forms for data collection was distributed via the online social media between June and August 2021. The satisfaction toward OS, IntR, and the GPP domains; places and equipment (PE), personnel (P), quality control (QC), and pharmacy services (PS) were collected using 5-Likert scales. Descriptive statistics, intra-class correlation, and multiple regression were used in data analysis with statistical significance at p-value<0.05. Results Three hundred and eighty-eight drugstore's customers responded to the questionnaires. Most customers rated the OS and the IntR at the highest level. The mean of the OS was 4.4±0.7 and the IntR was 4.6±0.7 points out of five. The OS and the IntR were highly correlated with the ICC of 0.719 (p-value<0.001). The satisfactions toward each GPP criteria were ranged between 3.9±0.9 to 4.6±0.7 indicating high levels of satisfaction. All 4 domains of the GPP standards explained the OS and the IntR with R square at 0.541 and 0.363, respectively. However, only PS and PE impacted the OS and only QC and PS impacted the IntR with statistical significance. Conclusion Thai customers had high levels of the OS and the IntR toward drugstore facilities and services based on the GPP standards. The PS was the domain that statistically influenced both the OS and the IntR, whereas the PE and the QC also statistically influenced the OS and the IntR, respectively. Since PE was the most weighted domain for current inspection, PS and QC should be more emphasized in future revision of the GPP inspection.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2016,35498228,Feasibility of using simulated patients for onsite structured practice feedback in Jordanian community pharmacy settings.  Simulated patient (SP) visits followed with structured feedback is useful to outline training needs as well as preference for continuing professional education in community pharmacy settings. This study aimed to investigate community pharmacists' management of an over-the-counter (OTC) product request and feasibility of immediate SP feedback in Jordan. Four trained SP visited a sample of pharmacies in three main urban cities in Jordan requesting an antacid. Information request and professional behavior as well as content of information were evaluated. The SP provided structured immediate feedback. The pharmacy staff views on the visit and usefulness of the feedback were collected. A total of 57 visits were conducted. The average duration of SP visits was 1.55 min. The average score (±SD) for information seeking behavior was 16% (±7) and for professional behavior was 56% (±15). The average score for information provision provided spontaneously was 17.1% (±12). Upon demand by the SP; the average score for information improved to 47.6 (±18). Non-pharmacological advice was not offered often; only 6 (10.5%) visits. Written information was provided in 10 (17.5%) visits. Immediate feedback was accepted by all visited pharmacies. Participants expressed positive views about the SP visit and usefulness of the feedback. Community pharmacists supplied OTC drug without carful screening of symptoms and essential information. The SP approach with immediate feedback was shown feasible and well accepted. Further potential for use of SP with feedback formally in practice and professional development should be explored in future studies.,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2017,35499399,"Associations between elevated depressive symptoms and substance use, prescription opioid misuse, overdose history, pain, and general health among community pharmacy patients prescribed opioids.  Background: Individuals with pain prescribed opioids experience high rates of comorbid depression. The aim of this study was to characterize pain, substance use, and health status as a function of depressive symptom level in individuals filling an opioid prescription at a community pharmacy. Methods: Participants (N = 1268) filling an opioid prescription enrolled in a study validating a prescription drug monitoring metric completed an online survey assessing sociodemographics, depressive symptoms, substance use, prescription opioid misuse, overdose history, general health, and pain severity and interference. Results: Approximately one-fifth (19.3%) had a positive depression screen result. In covariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, individuals with a positive depression screen result were more likely to have moderate/high substance use risk scores for prescription opioids (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-2.79); street opioids (AOR = 7.18; 95% CI, 2.57-20.01); cannabis (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.34-3.00); cocaine (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI, 1.46-8.22); tobacco (AOR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.18-2.15); methamphetamine (AOR = 7.59; 95% CI, 2.58-22.35); prescription stimulants (AOR = 2.95; 95% CI, 1.59-5.49); and sedatives (AOR = 3.41; 95% CI, 2.43-4.79). Individuals with a positive depression screen were more likely to misuse prescription opioids (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI, 2.33-5.15), experience a prior overdose (AOR = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.76-4.11), report poorer general health (AOR = 0.25, 95% CI, 0.18-0.35), and report moderate/severe pain severity (AOR = 4.36, 95% CI, 2.80-6.77) and interference (AOR = 6.47, 95% CI, 4.08-10.26).

2018,35499684,"[Children with atopic eczema deserve better care].  Constitutional eczema in children is common. It itches and has a negative impact on quality of life. Although there are good treatments, in practice many children appear to be undertreated. Possible causes of this are: insufficient knowledge about background and treatment and insufficient cooperation between care providers. In addition, many parents are unjustly afraid of the adverse effects of hormone ointments. Some caregivers are just as afraid of hormone ointments as parents. A comment from one of them can damage the confidence of parents in the effectiveness and safety of these ointments.In our opinion, children with eczema deserve better. That is why we propose to organize regional care, education and cooperation for children with eczema. Not only general practitioners and dermatologists should participate; pharmacists and pharmacy assistants, youth health care physicians and nurses and paediatricians should also join.

2020,35501229,"Effect of community pharmacist-provided patient education of partial fill availability for acute opioid prescriptions. BACKGROUND More than 191 million opioid prescriptions were filled in the United States during 2017, and studies have shown that patients often have leftover medication. OBJECTIVES To (1) measure the percentage filled as partial quantities and the percentage subsequently filled to completion; (2) determine which medications are filled as partial, completion, and full fills; and (3) identify patient reasons and demographics for partial, completion, and full fills. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Two pharmacies of a national community pharmacy chain in Richmond, VA. PRACTICE INNOVATION Virginia law allows prescriptions to be filled in partial quantities as long as the total quantity does not exceed the written quantity and the remaining portions are filled within 30 days of the written date. Pharmacists developed an intervention to educate patients about the option to fill opioid prescriptions as a partial quantity. EVALUATION METHODS Retrospective analysis of drug utilization reports to identify the impact of the pharmacist intervention for acute, nonmaintenance opioid prescriptions filled as partial, completion, or full fill during a 5-month period. Patient demographics and reasons for choosing a partial or full fill were collected using surveys completed at prescription pickup. RESULTS A total of 25.6% of included prescriptions were partially filled, and of these, only 31.9% were filled to completion. Hydrocodone-acetaminophen was the most common prescription, 35.8% full, 28.3% partial, and 36.4% completion fills. Patients' motivation was driven by the pharmacist's suggestion (48.5%) for partial fill and desire to have the medication if needed (36.6%) for full fill. CONCLUSION Pharmacist offer of partial filling of acute opioid prescriptions may lead patients to partially fill prescriptions, and patients cited the pharmacist suggestion as a motivator.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This prospective study included patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with LVEF < = 40% to evaluate the impact of pharmacist on guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT). The primary outcome was to compare proportion of triple GDMT achieved for Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-Inhibitors (ACEI)/Angiotensin-Receptor-Blockers (ARB)/Angiotensin-Receptor-Neprilysin-Inhibitors (ARNI), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists (AA), and quadruple GDMT which in additional to triple therapy, included Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) at 90-day post-enrollment compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints included achieving target and/or maximally tolerated ACEI/ARB/ARNI and beta-blockers combined and individually as well as SGLT2i and AA GDMT at 90-day post-enrollment compared to baseline. We also compared combined and individual HF-related hospitalization/emergency room (ER) visits 90 days pre-/post-enrollment. Of the total 974 patients screened, 80 patients seen at least once in the heart failure medication titration clinic (HMTC) were included in the analysis. Median (IQR) age was 71 (57-69) years with majority white male. There was a significant improvement in the proportion of patients who achieved quadruple GDMT (p = 0.001) and triple GDMT (p-value = 0.020) at 90-day post-enrollment compared to baseline.

2022,35501699,"Providing antibiotics to immigrants: a qualitative study of general practitioners' and pharmacists' experiences. BACKGROUND If healthcare professionals perceive that patients strongly expect to be prescribed antibiotics, inappropriate prescriptions may result. As it is unknown whether this happens more often with certain patient groups, we explored whether general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists perceived such expectations when they provided antibiotics to immigrant patients. METHODS Ten GPs and five pharmacists from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were interviewed on the basis of a semi-structured topic guide. Atlas.ti software was then used to conduct a thematic analysis. RESULTS GPs felt that immigrant patients, especially those who had arrived recently, were more likely to expect to receive antibiotics than native Dutch patients. However, these expectations had decreased over the last years and did not always lead immigrants to exert pressure on them. Except for language barriers, the factors reported by GPs to influence their antibiotic prescribing behaviour were unrelated to patients' immigrant background. If there was a language barrier, GPs experienced greater diagnostic uncertainty and needed additional time to obtain and communicate correct information. To overcome language barriers, they often used point-of-care testing to convince patients that antibiotics were unnecessary. Although pharmacists rarely experienced problems dispensing antibiotics to immigrants, they and GPs both struggled to find effective ways of overcoming language barriers, and stressed the need for multi-language support materials. CONCLUSION While pharmacists rarely experience any problems providing antibiotics to immigrants, GPs regularly face language barriers with immigrant patients, which complicate the diagnostic process and communicating information in the limited available time. This sometimes leads antibiotics to be prescribed inappropriately.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2023,35501712,"Health alliance for prudent prescribing and yield of antibiotics in a patient-centred perspective (HAPPY PATIENT): a before-and-after intervention and implementation study protocol. BACKGROUND Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics is the most important driver of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of the HAPPY PATIENT project is to evaluate the adaptation of European Union (EU) recommendations on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human health by evaluating the impact of a multifaceted intervention targeting different categories of healthcare professionals (HCPs) on common community-acquired infectious diseases, especially respiratory and urinary tract infections. METHODS/DESIGN HAPPY PATIENT was initiated in January 2021 and is planned to end in December 2023. The partners of this project include 15 organizations from 9 countries. Diverse HCPs (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians) will be audited by the Audit Project Odense (APO) method before and after an intervention in four different settings: general practice, out of hours services, nursing homes and community pharmacies in four high antibiotic prescribing countries (France, Poland, Greece, and Spain) and one low prescribing country (Lithuania). About 25 individuals from each professional group will be recruited in each country, who will register at least 25 patients with community-acquired infections during each audit period. Shortly before the second registration participants will undertake a multifaceted intervention and will receive the results from the first registration to allow the identification of possible quality problems. At these meetings participants will receive training courses on enhancement of communication skills, dissemination of clinical guidelines with recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, posters for the waiting rooms, and leaflets for patients. The results of the second registration will be compared with those obtained in the first audit. DISCUSSION HAPPY PATIENT is an EU-funded project aimed at contributing to the battle against antibiotic resistance through improvement of the quality of management of common community-acquired infections based on interventions by different types of HCPs. It is hypothesized that the use of multifaceted strategies combining active intervention will be effective in reducing inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics.

Objectives To assess pharmacists from Syria and Iraq on their knowledge, readiness, and perspectives on their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to investigate pharmacists' perceived barriers towards delivering their emergency roles during the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived policymakers' responsibilities. Methods This cross-sectional study design was conducted in Iraq and Syria during COVID-19 outbreak over one month (April 2020). The study objectives were addressed through a validated online questionnaire. Data was analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). Results A total of 916 individuals participated in this study (447 from Iraq and 439 from Syria). Most of Iraqi participants were students while most of Syrian participants were graduates and technicians. The mean age for the Iraqi participants was 22.5 (SD= 4.1) while the mean age for the Syrian participants was 28.7 (SD= 9.1). A significant difference (p< 0.001) was found in following the latest coronavirus updates on management among pharmacy graduates and technicians and undergraduate students.

2026,35502826,"Penicillin allergy SHACK: Survey of hospital and community knowledge. AIM Penicillin allergy accounts for the majority of all reported adverse drug reactions in adults and children. Foregoing first-line antibiotic therapy due to penicillin allergy label is associated with an increased prevalence of infections by resistant organisms and longer hospitalisation. Clinician awareness of allergy assessment, referral indications, management of allergy and anaphylaxis is therefore vital but globally lacking. We aim to assess the knowledge of penicillin allergy, assessment and management in Western Australian health professionals. METHODS An anonymous survey was distributed to pharmacists, nurses and physicians within Western Australian paediatric and adult Hospitals, Community and General Practice. RESULTS In total, 487/611 were completed and included in the statistical analysis. Only 62% (301/487) of respondents routinely assessed for patient medication allergies. Of those who assessed allergy, 9% (28/301) of respondents met the Australian standards for allergy assessment. Only 22% (106/487) of participants correctly cited all indications for management with adrenaline in anaphylaxis to antibiotics and 67% (197/292) of physicians rarely or never referred to an allergy service. Paediatric clinicians had an increased understanding of allergy assessment and anaphylaxis management. Recent penicillin allergy education within a 5-year period led to significant improvements in allergy knowledge. CONCLUSION Overall, knowledge, assessment and management of penicillin allergies among practitioners in Western Australia are currently inadequate in adults and paediatric clinicians to provide safe and effective clinical care. The implementation of a targeted education program for WA health professionals is urgently required and is expected to improve clinician knowledge and aid standardised penicillin assessment (de-labelling) practices.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2027,35502998,"Dispensing patterns of mental health medications before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Canada: An interrupted time series analysis. BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the general population in all aspects of life. Estimates of mental health medication dispensing in Alberta were investigated to elucidate areas of need within mental health and pharmacy practice during the pandemic. METHODS We employed an interrupted time series analysis using linear regression models to estimate community and outpatient medication dispensing trends of 46 medications used to treat mental health disorders. Three parameters were examined. The first was the medication dispensing slope before COVID-19. The second was the immediate effect of COVID-19 on dispensing (i.e., the difference in dispensing rate between the month before and after the first case of COVID-19) and the third was the medication dispensing slope during COVID-19. RESULTS Dispensing rates of 61% (n = 34) of the examined medications remained similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, eight medications (i.e., amitriptyline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, and oxazepam) showed an immediate and significant increase in dispensing rate following the onset of the pandemic that was sustained over the first 13-months of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Initial increases in dispensing patterns of antidepressants may be attributed to a ""stockpiling phenomenon"" but the sustained higher levels of dispensing suggest an unfavorable shift in the population's mental health. Monitoring of medication dispensing patterns during COVID-19 may serve as a useful indicator of the population's mental health during the current pandemic and better prepare community pharmacists in future pandemic planning, medication dispensing strategies, and care of chronic medical conditions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2028,35503234,"Healthcare Providers' Perspectives Toward the Integration of over the Counter Supplements During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan.  Objective: During COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers (HCPs) have been inundated with consultations related to over the counter (OTC) dietary supplements' protective role. Thus, the present study focused on assessing HCPs perceptions toward OTC products integration during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Pertinent data was collected using validated-online survey comprising four sections: demographics, OTC supplementation perceptions, awareness related to safety of OTC supplements, confidence in recommending dosage and counseling to patients regarding OTC supplements' safety, and some health-related behaviors. Quantified perception score represented by corrected confidence-concern ratio was used in assessing perceptions, and associations between demographics with perception and awareness were explored. Results: A total of 600 responses were included in the final analysis. Vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D were the most popularly recommended OTC supplements. Most respondents indicated positive perceptions toward dietary supplementation while around 60% of respondents reported reluctance about the protective role of COVID-19 vaccination. Bachelor's degree holders (AOR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.25-10.33), pharmacists (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.5-9.5), and junior HCPs (<1 year experience) had improved perceptions compared to college graduates, physicians, and senior practitioners (AOR = .17, 95% CI = .04-.78 and AOR = .15, 95% CI = .02-.93), respectively. Conclusion: Suboptimal knowledge among HCPs toward the safety and hazards associated with integration of different OTC supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic dictates further education to ensure the safe integration of OTC supplements.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2030,35505447,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of pharmacists regarding asthma management: a cross-sectional study in Egypt. BACKGROUND Asthma is a significant public health issue that poses a substantial health and economic burden. Despite the availability of effective asthma medications, its management remain suboptimal. Recent asthma guidelines have highlighted the importance of pharmacist unique position and its interventional strategies in positively impacting asthma treatment outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the degree of Egyptian pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes, as well as their practices towards asthma management in line with the recent asthma guidelines. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted among 800 pharmacists working in different private and governmental sectors. The data were collected using a 37-item pre-validated self-administered KAP questionnaire. The data were analyzed using Student's t-test and analysis of variance to assess the association between each KAP level and the sociodemographic variables at the significance level of 0.05. RESULTS Of the 800 distributed questionnaire, a total of 550 participants (316 Male, and 234 Female) responded, representing a 68.7% response rate. The mean ± SD score of knowledge, attitude, practice, and barrier was 5.49 ± 1.65 (min = 0; max = 8), 23.5 ± 2.84 (min = 15, max = 30), 43.12 ± 8.61 (min = 28, max = 62), and 27.76 ± 3.72 (min = 17, max = 39), respectively. The results showed that poor knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were achieved by 30.54, 0, and 38.72% of participants, respectively. CONCLUSION Our findings revealed the inconsistencies between poor pharmacists' knowledge and practices with respect to their positive attitudes. The lack of pharmacists' knowledge and compliance to recent GINA guidelines in this study highlight the crucial need for effective Educational strategies that should better equip pharmacists for their potential role in asthma care.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Computerised tomographic (CT) peritoneography is performed on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to identify peritoneal boundary defects, dialysate maldistributions and loculated fluid collections. Iodinated contrast media are added to dialysate and infused through the dialysis catheter, and CT images are obtained. Chemical compatibility of contrast media with dialysis solutions has not been studied. In some institutions, pharmacists charged with oversight of compounded sterile preparations have placed a moratorium on the use of contrast media-dialysate mixtures until compatibility data become available. This study was undertaken to examine the compatibility of non-ionic iodinated contrast agents added to PD solution for the performance of CT peritoneography. METHODS 100 mL of three non-ionic iodinated contrast agents, iopamidol 370 mgI/mL, iohexol 300 mgI/mL and iodixanol 320 mgI/mL, were mixed with 2 L 1.5% dextrose PD solution and stored at 2-8°C, 25°C and 40°C. Observations at predefined intervals were made over 5 days for visual appearance, turbidity, pH, drug concentration and chemical degradation. RESULTS Iopamidol, iohexol and iodixanol were stable for 5 days under study conditions. The contrast-dialysate mixture remained clear and colourless, no turbidity changes observed, pH and drug concentrations were stable and no increase in existing impurities or new impurities were detected. CONCLUSIONS The addition of commonly used non-ionic iodinated contrast agents to 1.5% dextrose dialysis solution is chemically stable, meeting the criteria set forth in the standards and guidelines of the US Pharmacopeia and the Institute of Safe Medication Practices. A protocol for performing CT peritoneography is recommended herein to facilitate patient safety and diagnostic reliability of the imaging study.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2032,35505618,"Stigma by Association: To what Extent is the Attitude Toward Naloxone Affected by the Stigma of Opioid Use Disorder?  The United States opioid epidemic is fueled by illicit opioid abuse and prescription opioid misuse and abuse. Consequently, cases of opioid use disorder (OUD, opioid addiction), opioid overdose, and related deaths have increased since the year 2000. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses opioid intoxication to prevent death from overdose. It is one of the major risk mitigation strategies recommended in the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. However, despite the exponential increase in dispensing and distribution of naloxone, opioid overdose and related deaths have continued to increase; suggesting that the increased naloxone supply still lags the need. This discordance is attributed at least in part to the negative attitude toward naloxone, which is based on the belief that naloxone is only meant for ""addicts"" and ""abusers"" (OUD patients). This negative attitude or so-called naloxone stigma is therefore considered a major barrier for naloxone distribution and consequently, overdose-death prevention efforts. This article presents evidence that challenges common assertions about OUD stigma being the sole and direct driving force behind naloxone stigma, and the purported magnitude of the barrier that naloxone stigma constitutes for naloxone distribution programs among the stakeholders (patients, pharmacists, and prescribers). The case was then made to operationalize and quantify the construct among the stakeholders to determine the extent to which OUD stigma drives naloxone stigma, and the relative impact of naloxone stigma as a barrier for naloxone distribution efforts.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2033,35506711,"30-Day Readmission Reduction in a Skilled Facility Population Through Pharmacist-Driven Medication Reconciliation. BACKGROUND Transitions of care can be difficult to manage and if not performed properly, can lead to increased readmissions and poor outcomes. Transitions are more complex when patients are discharged to skilled nursing facilities. PURPOSE We assessed the impact of pharmacist-led initiatives, including medication reconciliation, on readmission rates between an academic medical center and a local skilled nursing facility (SNF). METHODS We conducted a two-phase quality improvement project focusing on pharmacist-led medication reconciliation at different points in the transition process. All-cause 30-day readmission rates, medication reconciliation completion rates, and total pharmacist interventions were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The combined intervention and baseline cohorts resulted in a 29.8% relative reduction (14.5% vs. 20.6%) in readmission rates. Medication reconciliation was completed on 93.8% of SNF admitted patients in the first phase and 97.7% of patients in the second phase. Pharmacist interventions per reconciliation were 2.39 in the first phase compared with 1.82 in the second phase. CONCLUSION Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation can contribute to reduction of hospital readmissions from SNFs and is an essential part of the SNF transition process.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Nursing home,
2034,35507568,"Community pharmacists' routine provision of drug-related problem-reduction services. OBJECTIVES The present study aimed to assess the degree of the provision of services for drug-related problems (DRPs) and the factors affecting provision within the community pharmacy setting in Irbid, a large city in Northern Jordan. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to community pharmacists in Irbid, Jordan during the period from January to May 2017. The survey is composed of background and practice characteristics, services provided routinely by the community pharmacists to address DRPs, and barriers and facilitators for DRP-reduction services. A summated score quantifying the degree of DRP-reduction service provision was calculated, which included overall scores and scores for the different scales and domains. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and a multivariate linear regression model for factors associated with the high provision of DRP-reduction service. RESULTS Two hundred community pharmacists out of 210 pharmacists approached completed the surveys yielding a response rate of 95.2%. The most frequent DRPs encountered within the routine practice in the community pharmacy were economic aspects (76.0%). The mean total score relating to different DRP-reduction services was 32.9 (58.8%) out of 56 as the maximum possible score. It was estimated that 28.2% of the responding pharmacists provided the service overall (scored more than 50% of the scale). For the assessment, intervention, and referral dimensions, similar percentages of providers of the services were achieved: 59.7%, 61.9%, and 49.0%, respectively. Lower rates of providers were achieved on the documentation scale (12.9%). The lack of recognition of the pharmacist role by physicians was the most commonly reported barrier to effective DRP-reduction services among community pharmacists (78.9%). The ability to receive external guidance was indicated by the majority of surveyed pharmacists (94.5%) as a potential facilitator to DRP-reduction services in this study. Predictors associated with high total scores were the presence of medical records for the patients in the pharmacy, patients contact the pharmacy using email, a high satisfaction in professional relationships with physicians, and pharmacists' age. CONCLUSION Even though community pharmacists in this study have been shown to deliver certain activities to address DRPs to a high degree, the overall rate of DRPs services was suboptimal. Community pharmacists reported several barriers that should be taken into consideration to facilitate the role of community pharmacists in providing adequate DRP reduction services to patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2035,35507635,"Identifying rates and risk factors for medication errors during hospitalization in the Australian Parkinson's disease population: A 3-year, multi-center study. BACKGROUND Admission to hospital introduces risks for people with Parkinson's disease in maintaining continuity of their highly individualized medication regimens, which increases their risk of medication errors. This is of particular concern as omitted medications and irregular dosing can cause an immediate increase in an individual's symptoms as well as other adverse outcomes such as swallowing difficulties, aspiration pneumonia, frozen gait and even potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant type syndrome. OBJECTIVE To determine the occurrence and identify factors that contribute to Parkinson's medication errors in Australian hospitals. METHODS A retrospective discharge diagnosis code search identified all admissions for people with Parkinson's disease to three tertiary metropolitan hospitals in South Australia, Australia over a 3-year period. Of the 405 case notes reviewed 351 admissions met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS Medication prescribing (30.5%) and administration (85%) errors during admission were extremely common, with the most frequent errors related to administration of levodopa preparations (83%). A higher levodopa equivalent dosage, patients with a modified swallowing status or nil by mouth order during admission, and patients who did not have a pharmacist led medication history within 24 hours of admission had significantly higher rates of medication errors. CONCLUSIONS This study identified 3 major independent factors that increased the risk of errors during medication management for people with Parkinson's disease during hospitalization. Thus, targeting these areas for preventative interventions have the greatest chance of producing a clinically meaningful impact on the number of hospital medication errors occurring in the Parkinson's population.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2036,35507636,"Identification of hand-foot syndrome from cancer patients' blog posts: BERT-based deep-learning approach to detect potential adverse drug reaction symptoms.  Early detection and management of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is crucial for improving patients' quality of life. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is one of the most problematic ADRs for cancer patients. Recently, an increasing number of patients post their daily experiences to internet community, for example in blogs, where potential ADR signals not captured through routine clinic visits can be described. Therefore, this study aimed to identify patients with potential ADRs, focusing on HFS, from internet blogs by using natural language processing (NLP) deep-learning methods. From 10,646 blog posts, written in Japanese by cancer patients, 149 HFS-positive sentences were extracted after pre-processing, annotation and scrutiny by a certified oncology pharmacist. The HFS-positive sentences described not only HFS typical expressions like ""pain"" or ""spoon nail"", but also patient-derived unique expressions like onomatopoeic ones. The dataset was divided at a 4 to 1 ratio and used to train and evaluate three NLP deep-learning models: long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). The BERT model gave the best performance with precision 0.63, recall 0.82 and f1 score 0.71 in the HFS user identification task. Our results demonstrate that this NLP deep-learning model can successfully identify patients with potential HFS from blog posts, where patients' real wordings on symptoms or impacts on their daily lives are described. Thus, it should be feasible to utilize patient-generated text data to improve ADR management for individual patients.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2037,35508009,"Relationship between depressive symptoms, burnout, job satisfaction and patient safety culture among workers at a university hospital in the Brazilian Amazon region: cross-sectional study with structural equation modeling. BACKGROUND Workplaces can be sources of mental distress. In healthcare services, this can also affect patients. OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of and factors associated with depressive symptoms, burnout, job satisfaction and patient safety culture and the relationships between these constructs, among healthcare workers. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study in a university hospital in Manaus, Brazil. METHODS Randomly selected workers were interviewed based on Brazilian-validated tools. We calculated the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of depressive symptoms and burnout using Poisson regression with robust variance; and the β-coefficient of safety culture and job satisfaction using linear regression. Outcome relationships were assessed using partial least-squares structural equation modeling. RESULTS 300 professionals were included; 67.3% were women. The prevalence of depressive symptom was 19.0% (95% CI: 14.5; 23.5%) and burnout, 8.7% (95% CI: 5.2; 12.3%). Lack of work stability increased depression (PR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.17; 3.01) and burnout (PR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.03; 4.57); and reduced job satisfaction (β = -11.93; 95% CI: -18.79; -5.07). Depressive symptoms and burnout were positively correlated, as also were job satisfaction and safety culture (P < 0.001); job satisfaction was negatively correlated with burnout (P < 0.001) and depression (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION Impermanent employment contracts increased depression and burnout and reduced job satisfaction. Job satisfaction reduced poor mental health outcomes and increased safety culture. Job satisfaction and safety culture were directly proportional (one construct increased the other and vice versa), as also were depression and burnout. Better working conditions can provide a virtuous cycle of patient safety and occupational health.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2039,35509234,"Pharmaceutical care education at pharmacy colleges in the Middle East and North Africa region: A systematic review. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE New pharmacy curricula include content that equip students with a bundle of professional and interpersonal skills that allows the provision of evidence-based patient-centred pharmaceutical care (PC). PC has been adopted as a practise model underpinning these new roles for pharmacists in developed countries. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that countries in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region have been relatively slow in including PC in pharmacy education. There seems to be a need to more accurately describe the extent to which PC is included in pharmacy education in the MENA region. The objective of this systematic review was (a) to determine the status of PC education in schools and colleges of pharmacy in the MENA region and (b) to identify pharmacy students' and/or educators' perceptions and attitudes towards PC, preparedness level to PC provision and perceived barriers to implement this practise model in countries of the MENA region. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, International Pharmaceutical Abstract and ProQuest databases to identify articles published from 2000 to 2021. Selection of studies for inclusion in the review was based on a pre-determined eligibility criterion to retrieve original research articles addressing the review objectives. RESULTS Nine articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. The majority of the studies (n = 8) employed a survey-based research method. The studies were conducted in Jordan (n = 4), Kuwait (n = 2), Qatar (n = 2), Saudi Arabia (n = 1) and United Arab Emirates (n = 1). The findings suggest that pharmacy students had overall positive attitude and perception towards PC and some studies reported that students expressed good preparedness levels to implement most of the PC aspects. Several barriers to the implementation of PC were reported such as the slow educational reforms in pharmacy programs and a number of organizational and professional barriers. The studies provided recommendations for improvements in the pharmacy curricula to support pharmacy students' preparation to become competent PC practitioners. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The literature describing PC education in the MENA region is limited. Joint efforts among educational institutions and health authorities are needed to support PC implementation. There is a need to conduct further research to explore the status of PC education and practise in the different countries within the MENA region. This can drive future directions of pharmacy education to meet the needs of the pharmacy profession and healthcare systems in these countries.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2040,35509353,"Continuing Pharmacy Education: Exploring the Status and Future Prospects in Nepal.  Continuing pharmacy education (CPE) is an educational way for pharmacy professionals to develop competency in providing quality pharmaceutical care to patients. The CPE program helps maintain up-to-date knowledge and skills, increase the professionalism of pharmacists, and positively impact patient health outcomes. However, the concept and practice of CPE are still in their infancy in Nepal. Nepal's conventional pharmacy education system involves didactic lectures focusing more on theoretical learning than practical and experiential approaches, leading to the generation of pharmacists theoretically knowledgeable but practically non-competent to deliver pharmaceutical care services in independent practice settings. Additionally, in the absence of CPE, the professionals might miss updated information on new therapies, technologies, and approaches in patient management. The community and hospital pharmacies in Nepal are often business-oriented rather than service, and may not even be staffed by pharmacists, so the CPE programs are rarely conducted for the pharmacy professionals. Hence, the present commentary aimed to explore the status of CPE and its barriers or challenges in implementation and to suggest solutions in Nepal.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Despite the increase in the number of bariatric surgeries performed, little is known about the impact of the surgery on drug absorption. Unpredictability is assumed with drugs, given the anatomical changes after surgery. Objective To evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on drug absorption based on the type of procedure performed. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature review searching PubMed/Medline for published studies (from inception to December 2017) that evaluate the use of drugs and the assessment of drug absorption after bariatric surgery. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, case reports, and observational studies were included in our review. Results We found 60 studies addressing drug use after bariatric surgery. Twenty-eight studies reported a decrease in drug absorption after bariatric surgery while only four studies showed an increase in drug absorption. Unchanged absorption of drugs was seen in 23 studies after the surgery. Conclusion The available information shows variations in drug absorption after bariatric surgery. The unpredictability may result from factors related to the patient, drug, and/or type of surgery. Therefore, pharmacists' involvement and close monitoring of patients after bariatric surgery could be effective to avoid sub-/supratherapeutic responses.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2042,35509509,"Evaluation of Closed System Transfer Devices in Preventing Chemotherapy Agents Contamination During Compounding Process-A Single and Comparative Study in China. Aim We performed a comparative study to investigate the efficacy of closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) on the safe handling of injectable hazardous drugs (HDs). Methods The exposure assessments of cyclophosphamide and cytarabine were performed under traditional or CSTDs. For preparation activity, chemotherapy contamination samples on protective equipment (such as gloves and masks) were collected. The contamination analysis was performed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A 6-item form was distributed monthly (form M1-M6, total 6 months) to assess the pharmacists' experience on ergonomics, encumbrance, and safety impression. Results Totally, 96 wiping samples were collected throughout the study. The numbers of contaminated cyclophosphamide samples reduced under CSTD were -37.8, -41.6, -67.7, -47.3, and -22.9% and cytarabine were -12.3, -12.1, -20.6, -69.6, and -56.7% for left countertop, right countertop, medial glass, air-intake vent and door handle, as compared to traditional devices. The reduction was similar to pharmacist devices, i.e., -48.2 and -50.0% for masks and gloves cyclophosphamide contamination, -18.0 and -42.4% for cytarabine. This novel system could improve contamination on dispensing table, transfer container, and dispensing basket by -16.6, -6.0, and -22.3% for cyclophosphamide and -28.5, -22.5, and -46.2% for cytarabine. A high level of satisfaction was consistently associated with ergonomics for CSTD during the compounding process. Meanwhile, a slightly decreased satisfaction on ergonomics, encumbrance, and safety impression was observed for the traditional system between M2 and M3. Conclusion Closed system transfer devices are offering progressively more effective alternatives to traditional ones and consequently decrease chemotherapy exposure risk on isolator surfaces.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE To help ensure that we were accurately and consistently evaluating applicants to our postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residency program, we performed a job analysis to inform a redesign of our selection process. SUMMARY A diverse panel of subject matter experts from our program was convened to develop a task inventory; a list of knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics necessary for success in our program; and behavioral snapshots representing especially strong or weak resident performance (ie, critical incidents). After achieving a priori thresholds of consensus, these items were used to augment our application screening instrument (eg, development of anchored rating scales), build an online supplemental application consisting of a personality test and situational judgment test, develop a work sample consisting of a patient case presentation, and enhance the structure of our interviews (eg, by asking a consistent pattern of questions for all candidates). Preceptors reported that the redesigned process was more organized, easier to complete, and facilitated greater rating consistency.

METHODS Summaries of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) Resident Matching Program from 2008 to 2021 were obtained. Only standalone PGY2 residencies were included in the analysis. Descriptive analyses were completed for data related to the programs and positions. RESULTS From 2008 to 2021, the total number of ASHP-accredited PGY2 programs increased from 282 to 1,131 (301%) and the overall number of unfilled positions decreased from 22% (77 of 351) to 2% (34 of 1,492). The percentage of positions filled early increased from 23% (81 of 351) to 40% (594 of 1,492) during this time. In 2021, programs with a clinical focus accounted for 91.6% of total positions. The Ambulatory Care category accounted for the largest percentage of all PGY2 residency positions, at 19.2% (287 of 1,492) in 2021 compared to 12.8% (45 of 351) in 2008. The total share of PGY2 residency positions in the Critical Care category decreased from 22.8% (80 of 351) in 2008 to 13.7% (205 of 1,492) in 2021; however, the share of PGY2 residency positions in the Emergency Medicine category increased from 1.4% (5 of 351) to 5.9% (88 of 1,492). CONCLUSION From 2008 to 2021 the total number of PGY2 residencies increased; however, this growth was uneven, as the share of positions within individual residency categories changed.

2048,35511925,"Burnout among pharmacy professionals in Qatar: A cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Pharmacists' roles and responsibilities have expanded in the modern pharmacy profession, and the expectations from pharmacists have increased. This has been associated with new psychological challenges and emotional stress that can induce burnout. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of burnout syndrome and factors associated with burnout among pharmacy professionals in the healthcare system in Qatar. METHODS This institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 850 pharmacy professionals within Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Qatar. Convenience sampling was followed. The survey utilized the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Toolkit™ for Medical Personnel and a modified version of the Astudillo and Mendinueta questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 for Windows and SAS Studio 3.8 (Enterprise Edition). P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS One hundred ninety-four pharmacy professionals (23%) responded to the survey. The prevalence of burnout was 19.7% [95% Confidence interval (CI); 13.8% - 26.8%] among 142 respondents who completed MBI questionnaire and 17.3% [95% CI; 11.7%-24.2%] among 139 respondents who completed Astudillo Mendinueta questionnaire. The most commonly reported factors that may lead to burnout were: tension and lack of organization in teamwork (59.6%), lack of recognition of or indifference to effort from patients, superiors, and colleagues (58.2%), and demanding and challenging patients and family members (56.7%). Multiple regression analysis showed that overtime working hours per month is independently associated with a higher risk of burnout [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15-2.14 for each 10-hours increase in monthly overtime, P = 0.005], while non-Arab ethnicity is associated with lower risk of burnout [OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.1-0.75; P = 0.012].

2052,35517043,"Baseline Characteristics and Secondary Medication Adherence Patterns Among Patients Receiving Tafamidis Prescriptions: A Retrospective Analysis Using a National Specialty Pharmacy Dispensing Database. Introduction Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a serious, underrecognized condition, which leads to heart failure and early mortality if left untreated. Until recently, heart transplantation was the only treatment for ATTR-CM. Regulatory approval of tafamidis transformed treatment for patients. In the phase 3 Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), which established the safety and efficacy of tafamidis, medication adherence was high with 97.2% of patients taking ≥80% of scheduled doses. Evidence of real-world adherence to cardiology drugs demonstrates low adherence and suboptimal outcomes; however, real-world adherence to tafamidis has not been investigated. The main objective of this study was to describe adherence patterns of patients filling tafamidis in the Symphony Health database. Methods This retrospective analysis of the Symphony Health Solutions claims database used secondary adherence measures, including modified medication possession ratio (MPRm), days between fills adherence rate, and compliance rate, to assess adherence patterns of 2020 patients filling tafamidis free acid 61-mg capsules or tafamidis meglumine 4x20-mg capsules from June 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020. Results Patients receiving a tafamidis formulation had characteristics consistent with the expected patient population; 71.6% were aged 75-84 years, 83.2% were male, and the highest proportion resided in the Northeast region (30.5%) of the United States. Adherence for tafamidis was high, as 75% to 100% of the patients across subgroups met or exceeded the commonly defined adherence threshold of 80%. Median number of refills ordered and received was six refills per patient. Most patients received refills with no gap (n=1633) or a gap <30 days (n=1267/1317 patients). Adherence was high across follow-up time, sex, and age subgroups. Adherence varied by geographic region, with the Northeast being significantly higher than the Midwest (mean MPRm 94.41% vs 88.21%, p=0.0007). Conclusion These results provide evidence that real-world adherence to tafamidis in patients with ATTR-CM is high.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim: We aimed to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical service intervention on medication adherence and patient-reported outcomes among patients diagnosed with depression in a private psychiatric hospital in Nepal. Methods: A single-center, open trial with a parallel design was conducted among 18 to 65 years aged patients, diagnosed with depression and under antidepressant medication(s) for ≥2 months. Patients were randomised into either the intervention or control group. The control group (n = 98) received the usual care, while the intervention group (n = 98) received a pharmaceutical service intervention. The two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, independent t-test, or chi-square test at 2 and 4 months for changes in medication adherence and patient-reported [severity of depression and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)] outcomes. Results: One hundred ninety adult patients were enrolled in the study. At baseline, there were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures between the intervention and control groups.

2063,35521003,"Economic Evaluation of a Pharmacist-Led 5-Day Therapeutic Hold of IV Levothyroxine at an Academic Medical Center.  Objective: Providers often admit patients with active outpatient prescriptions for levothyroxine. During an inpatient admission, providers may instruct critically ill patients to take nothing by mouth, or nil per os (NPO). Thus, they may prescribe the intravenous (IV) formulation of levothyroxine during this period. However, levothyroxine possesses a prolonged half-life of up to 7 days; therefore, immediate transition to IV levothyroxine may not be clinically necessary in the acute NPO setting. Intravenous levothyroxine is significantly more expensive than equivalent oral doses and may prove to be a financial burden for an institution. By understanding the pharmacokinetic properties of levothyroxine, we implemented a cost-saving initiative involving a 5-day therapeutic hold of IV levothyroxine. Methods: This was a retrospective evaluation in 2 intensive care units (ICU): a 20-bed surgical/trauma ICU and an 18-bed mixed medical/surgical ICU. Patient data, utilization data, and documented pharmacist interventions were collected for 6 months prior to implementation of the 5-day IV levothyroxine therapeutic hold and for 6 months post-implementation. All patients prescribed IV levothyroxine during these timeframes were included. Results: During the 6-month pre-implementation phase, 674 doses (691 vials) of IV levothyroxine for 77 unique patients were dispensed from the 2 ICUs. During the 6-month post-implementation phase, 168 doses (188 vials) of IV levothyroxine were dispensed for 44 unique patients. Of the 44 patients (48 orders) who still received IV levothyroxine, 22.9% of orders were deemed clinically necessary by the pharmacist and were not recommended to be held under the protocol, 64.6% were due to the verifying pharmacist being unaware of the protocol, 8.3% of orders were due to protocol non-compliance, and 4.2% were verified after the 5-day hold was complete as the patient remained NPO. This pharmacy-led initiative resulted in a 75% decrease in usage post-implementation and an estimated annualized savings of $80,000. Conclusion: A pharmacy-led initiative comprised of a 5-day therapeutic hold of IV levothyroxine was feasible and led to a 75% reduction in usage and cost over a 6-month period in 2 ICU's. Future steps include additional staff education for improved protocol adherence and expanding the protocol institution-wide for an even greater cost-savings potential.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Critical care,,,,Inpatient,
2064,35521004,"Hospital Pharmacists Interventions to Drug-Related Problems at Tertiary Critical Care Pediatric Settings in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.  Background: While drug-related problems (DRPs) have been recognized as a major concern in pediatric wards, the role of hospital pharmacy in improving medication safety has been rarely studied. Objectives: To investigate the frequency, nature, and severity of DRPs and associated pharmacist interventions (PIs). Methods: This is a prospective study carried out using direct observation over a year (2019-2020) in 3 pediatric wards (pediatric emergency department (PED), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. A validated data reporting form was developed to include comprehensive clinical data about the prescribed medications, characteristics of patients, and PIs upon DRPs. Clinical significance of DRPs was evaluated by an expert panel, which comprised a clinical pharmacist, a pediatrician, and an internist. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS V26. Results: The overall incidence of DRPs was 6.6%. The highest rate of DRPs 15.2% was detected in the pediatric ICU. Of the 596 DRPs detected, 10.2% were inappropriate drug choice, 5.2% were rated major DRPs, and one-third 33.2% were related to the digestive system and metabolism. Dosing problems were the most predominant DRPs across the included wards. A higher proportion of clinically major and moderate DRPs were detected in pediatric ED. Telephone-delivered interventions [OR: 1.72: 95%CI: 0.78-2.57: P = .001], too high dose [OR: 2.64: 95%CI: 1.33-4.56: P = .01], and major DRPs [OR: 3.21: 95%CI: 2.15-6.42: P = .04] were significant predictors for acceptance of PIs. Conclusion: DRPs are common in Saudi pediatric wards and many of these incidents were clinically major and moderate.

2067,35521012,"Development of a Pharmacist-Led Opt-Out Cessation Treatment Protocol for Combustible Tobacco Smoking Within Inpatient Settings.  Background: Although people who smoke cigarettes are overrepresented among hospital inpatients, few are connected with smoking cessation treatment during their hospitalization. Training, accountability for medication use, and monitoring of all patients position pharmacists well to deliver cessation interventions to all hospitalized patients who smoke. Methods: A large Midwestern University hospital implemented a pharmacist-led smoking cessation intervention. A delegation protocol for hospital pharmacy inpatients who smoked cigarettes gave hospital pharmacists the authority to order nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during hospitalization and upon discharge, and for referral to the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) at discharge. Eligible patients received the smoking cessation intervention unless they actively refused (ie, ""opt-out""). The program was pilot tested in phases, with pharmacist feedback between phases, and then implemented hospital-wide. Interviews, surveys, and informal mechanisms identified ways to improve implementation and workflows. Results: Feedback from pharmacists led to changes that improved workflow, training and patient education materials, and enhanced adoption and reach. Refining implementation strategies across pilot phases increased the percentage of eligible smokers offered pharmacist-delivered cessation support from 37% to 76%, prescribed NRT from 2% to 44%, and referred to the WTQL from 3% to 32%. Conclusion: Hospitalizations provide an ideal opportunity for patients to make a tobacco quit attempt, and pharmacists can capitalize on this opportunity by integrating smoking cessation treatment into existing inpatient medication reconciliation workflows.

Aims The primary aim of this current study was to investigate the impact of the clinical pharmacist interventions on glycemic control and other health-related clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes in Egypt. Methods A prospective trial was conducted on 100 patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes admitted in the diabetes outpatient's clinics. Patients were randomly allocated into the clinical pharmacist intervention group and usual care group. In the intervention group, the clinical pharmacist, in collaboration with the physician had their patients receive pharmaceutical care interventions. In contrast, the usual care group patients received routine care without clinical pharmacist's interference. Results After 6-month of follow-up, of the average HbA1c and FBG values of the patients in the clinical pharmacist intervention group (HbA1c % from 8.6 to 7.0; FBG (mg/dL) from 167.5 to 121.5) decreased significantly compared to the usual care group patients (HbA1c % from 8.1 to 7.8; FBG (mg/dL) from 157.3 to 155.9) (P < .05). Additionally, the results indicated that mean scores of patients 'diabetes knowledge, medication adherence, and diabetes self-care activities of the patients in the clinical pharmacist group increased significantly compared to the control group (P < .05).

2069,35521019,"A Pharmacist-Driven Glycemic Control Protocol to Reduce the Rate of Severe Hypoglycemia in High-Risk Patients.  Purpose: Hospital pharmacists contribute to patient safety and quality initiatives by overseeing the prescribing of antidiabetic medications. A pharmacist-driven glycemic control protocol was developed to reduce the rate of severe hypoglycemia events (SHE) in high-risk hospitalized patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the rates of SHE (defined as blood glucose ≤40 mg/dL), before and after instituting a pharmacist-driven glycemic control protocol over a 4-year period. A hospital glucose management team that included a lead Certified Diabetes Educator Pharmacist (CDEP), 5 pharmacists trained in diabetes, a lead hospitalist, critical care and hospital providers established a process to first identify patients at risk for severe hypoglycemia and then implement our protocol. Criteria from the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists was utilized to identify and treat patients at risk for SHE. We analyzed and compared the rate of SHE and physician acceptance rates before and after protocol initiation. Results: From January 2015 to March 2019, 18 297 patients met criteria for this study; 139 patients experienced a SHE and approximately 80% were considered high risk diabetes patients. Physician acceptance rates for the new protocol ranged from 77% to 81% from the year of initiation (2016) through 2018. The absolute risk reduction of SHE was 9 events per 1000 hospitalized diabetic patients and the relative risk reduction was 74% SHE from the start to the end of the protocol implementation. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that SHE decreased by 1.5 events per 1000 hospitalized diabetic patients (95% confidence interval, -1.54 to -1.48, P < .001) during the 2 years following the introduction of the protocol. This represents a 15% relative reduction of SHE per year. Conclusion: The pharmacist-driven glycemic control protocol was well accepted by our hospitalists and led to a significant reduction in SHE in high-risk diabetes patient groups at our hospital.

2071,35521024,"Real-Time Risk Tool for Pharmacy Interventions. Background Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in excess hospitalizations. Thorough admission medication histories (AMHs) may prevent ADEs; however, the resources required oftentimes outweigh what is available in large hospital settings. Previous risk prediction models embedded into the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) have been used at hospitals to aid in targeting delivery of scarce resources. Objective To determine if an AMH scoring tool used to allocate resources can decrease 30-day hospital readmissions. Design Setting and Participants Propensity-matched cohort study, Medicine/Surgery patients in large academic safety-net hospital. Intervention or Exposure Pharmacy-conducted AMHs identified by risk model versus standard of care AMH. Main Outcomes and Measures A total of 30-day hospital readmissions and inpatient ADE prevention. Results The model screened 87 240 hospitalizations between June 2017 and June 2019 and 4027 patients per group were included. There were significantly less 30 day readmissions among high-risk identified patients that received a pharmacy-conducted AMH compared to controls (11% vs 15%; P = 0.004) and no significant difference in readmission rates for low-risk patients. While there was significantly higher documentation of major ADE prevention in the pharmacy-led AMH group versus control (1656 vs 12; P < 0.001), there was no difference in electronically-detected inpatient ADEs between groups. Conclusions A risk tool embedded into the EMR can be used to identify patients whom pharmacy teams can easily target for AMHs. This study showed significant reductions in readmissions for patients identified as high-risk. However, the same benefit in readmissions was not seen in those identified at low-risk, which supports allocating resources to those that will benefit the most.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Inpatient,

BACKGROUND Current literature and practice have demonstrated that pharmacists have an integral role in deprescribing. However, research regarding their impact on patients with chronic diseases is limited. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a pharmacist-led intervention on deprescribing inappropriate medication for patients with chronic diseases within a four-month study period compared to patients receiving usual care. METHODS This study was conducted at NYU Langone Health. Patients of the intervention group were referred by a provider and met the criteria of polypharmacy, required chronic disease states management, were nonadherent to medications, had poor health literacy, or required titration for heart failure (HF) guideline directed medical therapy. RESULTS A total of 142 patients were reviewed over a two-year period. At the end of the study period, the median number of medications for the two respective groups was similar (11 [4 - 30] vs 11 [2 - 23]). The pharmacist-led intervention had on average one medication deprescribed (m = -1.00, sd = 2.57), whereas the control group had on average .44 additional medications (m = 0.44, sd = 3.32) prescribed. Furthermore, the intervention group presented statistically significant differences (P = 0.046) regarding their diastolic blood pressure after the pharmacists' intervention (m = 72.69, sd = 11.64). Most importantly, patients with HF presented statistically significant improvement in their ejection fractions after the intervention (m = 41.46%, sd = 19.28%).

OBJECTIVES The study objectives were to (1) describe the characteristics of the pharmacy professionals and (2) explore the association between job satisfaction and factors, such as work control, work stress, workload and organization and professional commitments. METHODS This study was a cross-sectional design. The survey items were mainly adapted from the US National Pharmacist Workforce Survey. An electronic (Qualtrics) questionnaire was posted on pharmacist social media in several Arab countries. The survey link was posted from 22 March 2021 to 1 May 2021. The multiple linear regression measured the association between 12 independent variables and pharmacist job satisfaction. KEY FINDINGS A total of 2137 usable surveys were received from pharmacists (54.7% female) working in 18 Arabic countries. The job satisfaction rate varied among countries in the Arab world. The fields with the highest satisfaction average included pharmaceutical marketing, academia and the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, pharmacists working in community pharmacy and Ministry of Health/administrative positions had the lowest satisfaction rates. Overall, pharmacist satisfaction was average (3.1 out of 5). The pharmacists had the lowest satisfaction averages with income and job expectations. The pharmacists with bachelor's degrees had significantly lower satisfaction than pharmacists with postgraduate degrees. Male pharmacists had significantly higher job satisfaction compared with female pharmacists. Workload and the feelings of organization and professional commitments had significant positive associations with job satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The pharmacy profession in Arabic countries faced several challenges that negatively impacted job satisfaction.

2075,35522626,"Evaluation of a multicomponent intervention consisting of education and feedback to reduce benzodiazepine prescriptions by general practitioners: The BENZORED hybrid type 1 cluster randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND Current benzodiazepine (BZD) prescription guidelines recommend short-term use to minimize the risk of dependence, cognitive impairment, and falls and fractures. However, many clinicians overprescribe BZDs and chronic use by patients is common. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions delivered by general practitioners (GPs) on reducing prescriptions and long-term use of BZDs. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention for GPs that seeks to reduce BZD prescriptions and the prevalence of long-term users. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted a multicenter two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial in 3 health districts in Spain (primary health centers [PHCs] in Balearic Islands, Catalonia, and Valencian Community) from September 2016 to May 2018. The 81 PHCs were randomly allocated to the intervention group (n = 41; 372 GPs) or the control group (n = 40; 377 GPs). GPs were not blinded to the allocation; however, pharmacists, researchers, and trial statisticians were blinded to the allocation arm. The intervention consisted of a workshop about the appropriate prescribing of BZDs and tapering-off long-term BZD use using a tailored stepped dose reduction with monthly BZD prescription feedback and access to a support web page. The primary outcome, based on 700 GPs (351 in the control group and 349 in the intervention group), compared changes in BZD prescriptions in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 inhabitants per day after 12 months. The 2 secondary outcomes were the proportion of long-term users (≥6 months) and the proportion of long-term users over age 65 years. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used to assess all clinical outcomes. Forty-nine GPs (21 intervention group and 28 control group) were lost to follow-up. However, all GPs were included in the ITT analysis. After 12 months, there were a statistically significant decline in total BZD prescription in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean difference: -3.24 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day, 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.96, -1.53, p < 0.001). The intervention group also had a smaller number of long-term users. The adjusted absolute difference overall was -0.36 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.16, p > 0.001), and the adjusted absolute difference in long-term users over age 65 years was -0.87 (95% CI: -1.44, -0.30, p = 0.003). A key limitation of this clustered design clinical trial is the imbalance of some baseline characteristics. The control groups have a higher rate of baseline BZD prescription, and more GPs in the intervention group were women, GPs with a doctorate degree, and trainers of GP residents. CONCLUSIONS A multicomponent intervention that targeted GPs and included educational meeting, feedback about BZD prescriptions, and a support web page led to a statistically significant reduction of BZD prescriptions and fewer long-term users. Although the effect size was small, the high prevalence of BZD use in the general population suggests that large-scale implementation of this intervention could have positive effects on the health of many patients.

BACKGROUND Studies examining the impact of pharmacy-dispensed naloxone programs on fatal opioid overdose rates are lacking. We examined the impact of the publicly funded Ontario Naloxone Program for Pharmacies (ONPP), implemented in June 2016, on provincial rates of opioid overdose deaths. METHODS We conducted a population-based interrupted time-series study between July 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. We considered a parsimonious model with terms for time, ONPP implementation, and time following the ONPP implementation. Models were adjusted for population characteristics, number of pharmacies and rate of naloxone distributed through non-pharmacy sites within provincial public health units. RESULTS In the parsimonious model, the ONPP was associated with a non-significant 9% reduction in the level of fatal opioid overdoses (rate ratio [RR] 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.06), a finding that was most pronounced in regions in the lowest tertile of implementation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62-0.91). Following multivariable adjustment, there was an increase in the level (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.94-1.19) and slope change (RR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10) of fatal overdose rates. CONCLUSION The ONPP is insufficient as a single intervention to meaningfully reduce rates of fatal opioid overdoses during a period in which the cause of these deaths shifted from prescription opioids to highly potent fentanyl analogs. Access to additional harm reduction, treatment, and other interventions is necessary to prevent deaths and optimize the health of people who use drugs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Prescribing errors can cause significant morbidity and occur in about 5% of prescriptions in English general practices. AIM Our aim was to describe the frequency and nature of prescribing problems in a cohort of GPs in training to determine whether they need additional prescribing support. DESIGN & SETTING A primary care pharmacist undertook a retrospective review of prescriptions issued between 09/10/2014 and 11/03/2015 by ten GPs in their final year of training from ten practices in England. METHOD Pre-existing standards, and expert panel discussion, were used to classify the appropriateness of prescribing. Data were imported into STATA Version 13 to perform descriptive analysis. An individualised report highlighting prescribing errors, suboptimal prescribing, and areas of good practice identified during the review was shared with the GPs in training and their trainers. This report was used to guide discussions during the GP in training's feedback session. RESULTS A total of 1028 prescription items were reviewed from 643 consultations performed by ten GPs in training. There were 92 prescribing errors (8.9%) and 360 episodes of suboptimal prescribing (35.0%). The most common types of error concerned medication dosages (n=30, 32.6% of errors). CONCLUSION Personalised review of prescribing revealed an error rate higher than recorded in a previous similar study mainly comprising GPs who had completed postgraduate training, and a substantially higher rate of suboptimal prescribing.

2079,35523537,"Development and implementation of medication-related clinical rules for obstetrics, gynaecology, and paediatric outpatients. OBJECTIVES Prescription errors can cause serious adverse drug events. Clinical decision support systems prevent prescription errors; however, real-time clinical rules in obstetrics, gynaecology, and paediatric outpatients remain unexplored. We evaluated the effects of localised, real-time clinical rules on alert rates and acceptance rates compared with manual prescription review. METHODS We developed real-time clinical rules that incorporate information systems to obtain characteristic information and laboratory values. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the alert and recommendation acceptance rates of all prescription error types before and after clinical rule implementation in obstetrics, gynaecology, and paediatrics. Clinical rules, prescription error types, and alerts were determined by a prescribing review committee comprising physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and administrators. The difference in alert and acceptance rates between the groups was analysed using relative risk. RESULTS The number of alerts increased after clinical rules implementation; the number of on-duty pharmacists for review decreased from 10 to 2. Compared with those with manual review, the alert rates for paediatrics and obstetrics and gynaecology increased with the clinical rules by 3.97- and 11.26-fold, respectively, and the alert rates for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and combined medication errors in obstetrics and gynaecology increased with the clinical rules by 26.10- and 26.54-fold, respectively. In paediatrics, the alert rate for all prescription error types was higher with the clinical rules review than with the manual review; the alert rates for DDI, dosage, and combination medication errors were significantly different between the clinical rules and the manual review. However, there was no difference in the recommendation acceptance rate between the manual review and the clinical rules. CONCLUSIONS Clinical rules can identify prescription errors that manual review cannot detect and ensure real-time review efficiency in high-volume outpatient prescription settings. The high acceptance rate and modification of prescriptions may be relevant to highly customised and localised clinical rules.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2081,35523691,"Utilization of an implementation framework to obtain provider perspectives of pharmacist-led clinical services. BACKGROUND Pharmacist integration into health care teams has been shown to improve patients' clinical outcomes and satisfaction with care. Medication therapy management (MTM) has been implemented in a variety of pharmacy practice settings. Pharmacist-provided medication reviews, a core element of MTM, have been shown to optimize therapeutic outcomes for patients and identify medication-related problems in a patient's current regimen. Patients receiving care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) often face a number of challenges, such as multiple health conditions, transportation, and medication costs. Pharmacist-provided services can play an important role in providing patient-centered care in FQHCs. Seeking stakeholder input can be valuable to ensure services will benefit both patients and providers. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to obtain provider perspectives of psychological, socioeconomic, and practice-based factors to consider before implementing a pharmacist-led medication review services in an FQHC in north central Indiana. METHODS Five nurse practitioners employed by an FQHC in north central Indiana were interviewed. Thirty-four questions within 5 general domains were developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Responses were manually transcribed, coded by 3 reviewers, and then summarized using thematic analysis. RESULTS Within the 5 interviews, a total of 97 codes were identified. The 251 mentions of the 97 codes were then thematically analyzed into 16 different themes. The 5 most referenced themes were feelings (N = 36), roles (N = 28), logistics (N = 26), benefits (N = 25), and communication (N = 21). Study participants noted that team roles, communication of information about the service, team or stakeholder concerns, and logistics should all be kept in mind when designing a new service. CONCLUSION Semistructured interviews with providers at an FQHC in north central Indiana revealed multiple factors to consider before implementing a new pharmacist-led service in the clinic.

2083,35525834,"Evaluation of research capacity and culture of hospital pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in a state-wide Australian public health service: A cross-sectional survey. BACKGROUND Integrating research with clinical practice is essential for evidence-based practice and continuous improvement in health care. Little is known about the research capacity and culture of the Australian hospital pharmacy workforce, particularly in rural areas and for pharmacy assistants/technicians. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to characterise the research capacity and culture of a state-wide public-hospital pharmacy service at organisation, team and individual levels, and to explore variables which influence research confidence and success. METHOD An online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey using the validated Research Capacity in Context tool was emailed to all pharmacists, pharmacy assistants/technicians and non-clinical staff employed by a statewide pharmacy service in South Australia. Respondent characteristics and organisation, team and individual scores of research skill/success were summarised using descriptive statistics. T-tests compared results for pharmacists and pharmacy assistants/technicians and metropolitan-based and non-metropolitan-based staff. Regression analyses explored predictors of pharmacists individual research skill/success scores. RESULTS A response rate of 43.4% (n = 278/641, 19 sites) was obtained. Respondents were primarily pharmacists (68%) and pharmacy assistants/technicians (28%); 91% were practicing in a metropolitan setting. 47% reported no research experience. Highest scores for research skill/success were observed at the organisational level (mean score 6.0/10) vs. team (mean score 5.6/10) and individual levels (mean score 5.1/10). Within each level specific items that scored poorly were identified. Individual research skills/success scores were higher in pharmacists vs. pharmacy assistants/technicians (mean score 5.2/10 vs. 4.2/10, p < 0.01), and were not different between staff in metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan settings (mean scores 5.2 vs. 5.0, p = 0.77). For pharmacists, undertaking undergraduate or internship research projects or postgraduate research training were associated with higher individual scores of research skills and success. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION This research extends understanding of hospital pharmacy research capacity and culture, describes research skills and success in hospital pharmacy technicians/assistants for the first time and highlights low-scoring areas; these could be targeted to improve research capacity and culture at an individual, team and organisational levels.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2085,35526277,"Perceptions of a virtual interview process for pharmacy residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multisite survey of residency candidates, preceptors, and residency program directors. PURPOSE To describe the perceptions of residency candidates, residency practitioners (current residents and preceptors), and residency program directors (RPDs) regarding a virtual interview process for pharmacy residency programs across multiple institutions. METHODS In May 2021, an anonymous web-based questionnaire characterizing perceptions of the virtual interview process used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was distributed to residency candidates, residency practitioners, and RPDs across 13 institutions. Quantitative responses measured on a 5-point Likert scale were summarized with descriptive statistics, and open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic qualitative methods. RESULTS 236 residency candidates and 253 residency practitioners/RPDs completed the questionnaire, yielding response rates of 27.8% (236 of 848), and 38.1% (253 of 663), respectively. Overall, both groups perceived the virtual interview format positively. When asked whether virtual interviews should replace in-person interviews moving forward, 60.0% (18 of 30) of RPDs indicated they agreed or strongly agreed, whereas only 30.5% (61 of 200) of current preceptors/residents and 28.7% (66 of 230) of residency candidates agreed or strongly agreed. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses revealed that while virtual interviews were easier logistically, the lack of in-person interactions was a common concern for many stakeholders. Lastly, the majority (65.0%) of residency candidates reported greater than $1,000 in savings with virtual interviews. CONCLUSION Virtual interviews offered logistical and financial benefits. The majority of RPDs were in favor of offering virtual interviews to replace in-person interviews, whereas the majority of residency candidates and practitioners preferred on-site interviews. As restrictions persist with the ongoing pandemic, our results provide insight into best practices for virtual pharmacy residency interviews.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2087,35526877,"Automated Dispensing Cabinet Overrides-An Evaluation of Necessity in a Pediatric Emergency Department. OBJECTIVE Automated dispensing cabinets, or ADCs, are often used at health care facilities to aid in the medication-use process. Although ADCs minimize certain medication errors, they introduce a new type of error involving overrides. Although helpful when used appropriately in emergencies, overrides bypass pharmacist verification and increase potential for patient harm through drug-drug interactions, medication allergies, inappropriate dosing, and more. The purpose of this study was to evaluate automated dispensing cabinets override pulls in a pediatric hospital's emergency department. The authors sought to discover whether overridden medications were being administered before verification (indicating it was needed emergently, thus justifying override) or after verification (indicating the override did not result in quicker administration and/or the medication was not emergent). METHODS This was a retrospective, observational study. Data were collected from electronic health record reports from a 343-bed pediatric hospital's emergency department from October 13, 2019, to December 22, 2019. RESULTS A total of 445 override pulls were identified during this time, and after data analysis, 99 override pulls remained in the data set. Overall, time from input of prescription into the electronic medical record to medication override was approximately 4 minutes. Pharmacist verification also took a median of four minutes after prescription input. However, administration took twice as long, at 8 minutes. On average, pharmacist verification occurred 4 minutes before medication administration. CONCLUSION This research from a pediatric emergency department suggests that most situations did not require an immediate administration, and perhaps an override was unnecessary and could have been avoided.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2088,35527209,"Identifying opportunities for pediatric medication therapy management in children with medical complexity. BACKGROUND Despite potential benefits of medication therapy management (MTM) for complex pediatric patients, implementation of pediatric MTM services is rare. OBJECTIVES To describe how a standardized pediatric MTM model identifies potential interventions and their impact on medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) scores in children with medical complexity (CMC) and polypharmacy. METHODS This retrospective proof-of-concept study included pediatric patients receiving primary care in a large outpatient primary care medical home for CMC within a tertiary freestanding children's hospital from August 2020 to July 2021. Medication profiles of established patients aged 0-18 years with at least 5 active medications at the time of the index visit were assessed for medication-related concerns, potential interventions, and potential impact of proposed interventions on MRCI scores. RESULTS Among 100 patients, an average of 3.4 ± 0.3 medication-related concerns was identified using the pediatric MTM model. Common medication-related concerns (>25% of patients) included inappropriate or unnecessary therapy, suboptimal therapy, undertreated symptom, adverse effect, clinically impactful drug-drug interaction, or duplication of therapy. A total of 97% had opportunities for 5.0 ± 2.9 potential interventions. Most common proposed interventions included drug discontinuation trial (69%), patient or caregiver education (55%), dosage form modification (51%), dose modification (49%), and frequency modification (46%). The mean baseline MRCI score was 32.6 (95% CI 29.3-35.8) among all patients. MRCI scores decreased by a mean of 4.9 (95% CI 3.8-5.9) after application of the theoretical interventions (P < 0.001). Mean potential score reduction was not significantly affected by patient age or number of complex chronic conditions. Potential impact of the proposed interventions on MRCI score was significantly greater in patients with higher baseline medication counts (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Most CMC would likely benefit from a pharmacist-guided pediatric MTM service. A standardized review of active medication regimens identified multiple medication-related concerns and potential interventions for nearly all patients. Proposed medication interventions would significantly reduce medication regimen complexity as measured by MRCI. Further prospective evaluation of a pharmacist-guided pediatric MTM service is warranted.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2089,35527824,"Exploring the impact of the United States-based accreditation council for pharmacy education certification on pharmacy education outside the United States. Introduction The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) offers certification for interested pharmacy programs outside the United States. This study aimed to explore the reported impact of this certification on the quality of pharmacy education among ACPE-certified pharmacy programs outside the US. Methods This cross-sectional study was based on highly structured, standardized interviews. A predetermined questionnaire was designed to include both quantitative and qualitative items, which assessed participants' thoughts on the impact of ACPE certification on the quality of pharmacy education as well as programmatic and student learning outcomes. A total of 15 pharmacy colleges and schools outside the US have received the ACPE certification as of July 2020. After IRB approval, these programs were invited to participate in online live interviews, which were scheduled from May to July 2020 via Zoom®, and lasted approximately 45 min each. Results Administrators from 13 programs participated in this study (87% respondent rate). The majority of these international pharmacy programs reported that the ACPE certification had promoted the quality of pharmacy education at their institutions. However, there were different views on how the ACPE certification has affected the operation of these international pharmacy programs. There was little or no impact of the certification on financial resources, such as salaries and development funds. Conclusion Despite being confined to little or no change in certain areas of their programs, all the interviewees believed the ACPE certification had an overall positive impact on the quality of their programs, particularly in the area of assessment, preceptor quality and development, improving teaching and learning methods in both didactic and experiential curricula, and developing an inclusive feedback system to receive input from various stakeholders.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2090,35527828,"Medication error awareness among health care providers in Palestine: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional observational study. Background Increased awareness among healthcare professionals regarding medication errors and the establishment of a medication error reporting system can significantly reduce the prevalence of medication errors. Unfortunately, Palestine lacks a regulatory system for the control, reporting, and education of medication errors. Objectives This study aimed to assess the awareness of medication errors and reporting of medication errors in the Palestinian medical community. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using a self-administered survey involving doctors, nurses, and pharmacists in Palestine. The survey consisted of 20 questions to assess healthcare providers' awareness and course of actions related to medication errors. Data were collected from February 2020 to April 2020. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analysis. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Birzeit University. Results A total of 394 participants were included, including 202 nurses, 114 doctors, and 78 pharmacists. 203 (51.5%) had a good awareness level of medication errors, whereas 126 (32%) and 65 (16.5%) had average awareness and poor awareness levels, respectively. In addition, 66.0% of providers did not inform the patients after recognizing the error. Fear of legal or social consequences and being too busy are significant barriers to reporting medication errors. Moreover, 35 % of all providers were not aware of the reporting system in their institutions or the reporting methodology, and only 26% of all participants confirmed that their institutions provided continuous education on medication errors. Conclusion This study revealed differences in healthcare professionals' awareness of medication errors. The study's findings emphasize the urgent need to adopt appropriate measures to raise awareness about medication errors among healthcare providers in Palestine.

2092,35527831,"Medication errors in Najran, Saudi Arabia: Reporting, responsibility, and characteristics: A cross-sectional study. Background Medication error is a preventable adverse effect of medical care, whether or not it is evident or harmful to the patient. Disclosure of medication errors and improvement of patient safety are inexorably related, and they provide one of the strongest reasons to report and disclose errors, including near misses in which no harm comes to the patient. This study aimed to identify medication errors at the southern province of Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted by reviewing all medical records in the King Khaled Hospital in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Medication errors related information were extracted from the electronic medical system for the duration between 2018 and 2020. Results During the study period of 2018 to 2020, a total of 4860 medication errors were identified. More than half of the reported medication errors (66.9%) were linked to ordering, prescribing, or transcribing medications. The most commonly reported medication errors connected to ordering/prescribing/transcribing were inappropriate dosage, dosage units, and therapeutic duplication of medication. The most commonly reported medication errors linked to administration were missing documentation during administration, not performing independent double-checks during the administration of high alert medications, and the administration of look-alike sound-alike (LASA) medications. The intensive care unit (ICU), female medical ward, and male medical ward were the most commonly reported locations for medication errors. Pharmacists detected more than half of the reported medication errors. Physicians were found to be responsible for 66.0% of reported medication errors, followed by nurses. Conclusion Medication errors are common in hospital settings in Saudi Arabia's southern provinces. Efforts should be made to improve drug ordering, prescribing, and transcription in hospital settings.

2093,35528114,"Development and In Vitro Evaluation of Oral Capsules from Antiaris: A Convenient Substitute for Peripheral Neuropathy.  Antiaris is a monoherbal decoction produced by the Centre for Plant Medicine Research (CPMR), Mampong-Akuapem, Ghana. It is prepared from the stem bark of Antiaris africana Engl. (Moraceae), prescribed, and dispensed to patients for the management of nervous disorders. This current formulation presents notable challenges in patients' adherence to treatment regimen due to its bulkiness and bitterness. These challenges have resulted in a decrease in therapeutic outcome. This study sought to transform Antiaris into oral capsules to mask its bitter taste and reduce bulkiness of the product to improve patients' convenience. In this study, four (4) conventional release capsule formulations were successfully prepared from the decoction via wet granulation using corn starch, lactose, light magnesium carbonate (LMC), and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and labelled A01, A02, A03, and A04 respectively. The drug-excipient compatibility studies on A01, A02, A03, and A04 were investigated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The flow properties of the granules as well as the quality assessment of the formulations such as dissolution, disintegration, uniformity of weight, and assay tests were evaluated using pharmacopoeial and nonpharmacopoeial methods. Appropriate models were used to investigate the difference factor (f 1 ) and similarity factor (f 2 ) of the dissolution profiles of the formulations and Antiaris. From the study, all formulated granules had excellent flow properties with Carr's index from 7.83 to 9.56%, Hausner's ratio from 1.09 to 1.10, and angle of repose from 25.13 to 27.87°. Drug-excipient compatibility studies demonstrated no interaction between extract and used excipients. All formulations passed the uniformity of weight, disintegration, assay, and dissolution tests. Formulation A02 had the highest dissolution efficiency of 100.12%, while A03 recorded the least value of 97.22% in the 1 h dissolution studies. A comparison of their various dissolution profiles, respectively, to that of its decoction demonstrated their similarity, since, in all comparisons, f 2 < 15 and f 1 > 50.

BACKGROUND  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) pose a major public health challenge in older adults. In sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of ADRD is projected to escalate amidst ill-equipped healthcare workers (HCWs). AIM  This study aimed to assess ADRD knowledge amongst Ghanaian HCWs and improve gaps identified through a workshop. SETTING  Study was conducted among HCWs attending a workshop in Kumasi, Ghana. METHODS  On 18 August 2021, a workshop on ADRD was organised in Kumasi, Ghana, which was attended by 49 HCWs comprising doctors, nurses, pharmacists, social workers and nutritionists. On arrival, they answered 30 pre-test questions using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). A post-test using the same questionnaire was conducted after participants had been exposed to a 4-h in-person educational content on ADRD delivered by facilitators from family medicine, neurology, geriatrics, psychiatry and public health. RESULTS  The mean age of participants was 34.6 (± 6.82), mean years of practice was 7.7 (± 5.6) and 38.8% (n = 19) were nurses. The mean score of participants' overall knowledge was 19.8 (± 4.3) at pre-test and 23.2 (± 4.0) at post-test. Participants' pre-test and post-test scores improved in all ADKS domains. Factors associated with participants' knowledge at baseline were profession, professional rank and the highest level of education attained. After adjusting for age and sex, participant's rank, being a specialist (adjusted β = 14.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.03, 21.85; p  0.001) was an independent predictor of knowledge on Alzheimer's disease.

2102,35532327,"Australian community pharmacists' ability to identify the indications for dental prescriptions-a case vignette study. OBJECTIVES Pharmacists are known as medicine experts. Dentists can independently prescribe and administer medications related to dental conditions such as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatories and analgesics. However, little is known about pharmacists' knowledge and perceptions of medicines prescribed for dentistry. Therefore, this study aimed to assess community pharmacists' ability to identify the indications for dental prescriptions using hypothetical vignettes. METHODS Australian community pharmacists were invited through email and social media to undertake a web-based questionnaire consisting of nine case vignettes of dental prescriptions and their indicated uses in dental settings and two perception-based questions. The results were provided as a percentage of the correct answers to the case vignettes. In addition, Pearson chi-square tests were performed to examine associations between categorical variables. KEY FINDINGS Of the 202 pharmacists who completed the questionnaire, the mean number of correct responses was 5 ± 2 (out of 9). More than three-quarters (78.5%) of pharmacists believed that thorough knowledge of prescriptions for dental ailments was necessary for safe and effective community pharmacy practice. In addition, nearly two-thirds (64.1%) felt confident that they could dispense medicines indicated for dental conditions safely and effectively. CONCLUSIONS The knowledge demonstrated by participants through correct identification of the indications for dental prescription was less than optimal. Professional development courses for pharmacists in dental ailments could prove beneficial.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Paediatric patients are at high risk of medication errors and adverse drug events due to complex medical care. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of pharmacist medication review for paediatric patients. SETTING A single-centre prospective observational study was performed over 33 months, from February 2018 to October 2020 in a French Hospital. METHOD Clinical pharmacists provided medication counselling at a hospital and conducted telephone follow-ups between 3 and 7 days after discharge of paediatric patients with chronic diseases for whom treatment was introduced or modified during hospitalisation or hospital consultations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The incidence of drug-related problems (DRPs), the number and type of pharmacist intervention and paediatrician acceptance rates were assessed. Parents' understanding and drug-related needs were compared before and after medication review. Time to outpatient treatment and patient satisfaction were determined. Statistical analyses were performed in Excel. RESULTS In total, 195 paediatric patients were included. Pharmacists identified 65 interventions, 95% of which were accepted. The most frequent DRPs included inappropriate drug administration (32.3%), herb-drug interactions (24.6%) and dose selection (17%). Parents' knowledge increased by 28% from baseline after pharmacist's medication counselling. Parents' drug-related needs concerning administration and side effects decreased by 67% and 49%, respectively, following the pharmacist's medication counselling. Most (75%) of the patients were able to get their treatment immediately after discharge.

METHOD Eight electronic databases and four trial registries were systematically searched from the date of inception to April 2020. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies of interventions to improve medicines optimisation (including administration, adherence, deprescribing, prescribing and/or medication review) in community-dwelling older people (aged ≥65 years) with a frailty diagnosis. Only studies published in English were included. A narrative synthesis was conducted, and quality was assessed using an appropriate risk of bias tool. KEY FINDINGS Searches identified 601 articles; one study met the criteria for inclusion. The single eligible study used a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test study design to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led, team-based medication review for 54 frail older patients living in primary care. Improvements in the total number of medications and prescribing appropriateness were observed. The study was judged to be at an overall serious risk of bias. CONCLUSION There is a dearth of high-quality evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of medicines optimisation interventions for older people with frailty within primary care. Due to the strong association between patients' level of frailty and adverse outcomes, it is important that future research focuses on proactive interventions which may be beneficial to this patient population.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Geriatric,,,,Community,
2105,35532379,"Well-rounded pharmacists: a longitudinal evaluation of a multi-sector pre-registration programme. INTRODUCTION Pharmacists traditionally work in either hospital or community settings and increasingly in primary care. As demands on health care continue to rise, pharmacists need a well-rounded understanding of the patient journey and transfer of care and be capable of working in any setting. In response, Health Education and Improvement Wales (HEIW) launched a multi-sector pre-registration pharmacy training programme. Trainees experience all three pharmacy settings throughout the year, in contrast to the traditional, single-sector programmes. OBJECTIVES To explore the views of the now-qualified pharmacists, their tutors and line managers on the multi-sector programme and how it prepares pharmacists for practice. METHODS This longitudinal study followed pharmacists through the multi-sector programme, to approximately 1 year post-registration. Data were collected via interviews (n = 27) with pharmacists, tutors and line managers. All data were pattern coded and analysed thematically. KEY FINDINGS Pharmacists maintained that they benefited from the multi-sector training programme and would choose this option again. Pharmacists, tutors and line managers considered that the programme provided a more holistic perspective of pharmacy than single-sector programmes and a greater understanding of patient journeys and transfer of care. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of consensus on how the programme is best structured, and there is scope to increase the hands-on experience in primary care settings. CONCLUSIONS Greater communication across sectors and smoother transfer of patient care benefit employers and patients as well as the pharmacists. Recommendations for future multi-sector programmes are suggested.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2106,35532708,"Impact of patient counseling on treatment adherence behavior and quality of life in maintenance hemodialysis patients.  Life in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is miserable; food and fluid restrictions are mandatory due to impaired renal function. Patient involvement forms a key role in the management of ESRD. Hence, a direct impact of patient counseling on treatment adherence and quality of life (QOL) could be established, which forms the basis of this study. We conducted a prospective interventional study of 10 months, where the ESRD-Adherence Questionnaire and Kidney Disease QOL (KDQOL) data were used to study the effect of patient counseling. A total of 121 patients enrolled in the study with mean age of 62.14 ± 11.41 years. The adherence factors indicated that 97% were adherent to dialysis sessions, followed by 67.77% toward diet and 60.33% toward fluid. On assessing the influence of counseling on QOL and adherence to various factors affecting ESRD, a positive correlation could be observed, which indicates the impact of pharmacist intervention in improving the QOL and patient compliance, thus the need for periodic counseling was established as an effective way to improve health-related QOL and awareness in ESRD.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
2107,35532973,"Assessing the Availability of Teleconsultation and the Extent of Its Use in Malaysian Public Primary Care Clinics: Cross-sectional Study. BACKGROUND The integration of teleconsultation into health care systems as a complement to existing approaches to care is growing rapidly. There is, however, limited information on the extent of its implementation across low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the availability and the extent of teleconsultation in Malaysian primary care clinics. METHODS A cross-sectional study of public primary care clinics in Malaysia was conducted between November 2020 and December 2020. All clinics in Malaysia that see more than 300 daily patients were recruited. A web-based, self-administered questionnaire including questions on availability of the service, whether it uses video or telephone, and the types of services it provides was distributed to the medical officer in charge of each clinic. RESULTS In total, 97.6% (249/255) of the clinics responded. Out of these clinics, 45.8% (114/249) provided teleconsultation. A majority of the clinics providing consultation (69/114, 60.5%) provided only telephone consultation, while 24.6% (28/114) of the clinics offered video and telephone consultation, and 14.9% (17/114) offered only video consultation. Eighty percent (92/114) of the clinics were located in urban areas. A breakdown by state showed that 17.5% (20/114) and 16.7% (19/114) of the clinics were from two larger states; other states comprised less than 10% each (range 7-9/114). For the clinics providing video consultation, funding for the service came mostly (42/45, 93%) from the Ministry of Health. Conversely, nearly 1 out of 4 (23/97) clinics that provided telephone consultation funded the service either from donations or through self-funding. Most of the clinics provided teleconsultation for diabetes and hypertension. Less than 50% of the clinics with teleconsultation used it for follow up with allied health care providers or pharmacists (video consultation, 20/45; telephone consultation, 36/97). CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that telephone consultation is more widely used than video consultation, despite a quarter of its funding being self-subsidized or obtained through donations. Also, teleconsultation was less utilized by allied health care providers and pharmacists. Plans for the expansion of teleconsultation in Malaysian primary health care should take into consideration these findings to ensure a better and more cost-effective implementation of the service.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2108,35533298,"GM-Pep: A High Efficiency Strategy to De Novo Design Functional Peptide Sequences.  Although peptides are regarded as ideal therapeutic agents, only a small proportion of the marketed drugs are peptides. In the past decade, pharmacists have paid great attention to the development of peptide therapeutics. Except a few approved chemically/rationally designed peptides, most attempts failed due to unsatisfactory efficacy or safety. Luckily, computation methods, such as artificial intelligence, have been utilized to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic peptides by predicting the activity, toxicity, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of polypeptides. Usually, a specific biological activity of a peptide could be accurately determined by an interest-oriented binary classification constructed of a positive set and another un-experimentally validated negative set regardless of other characteristics, which suggests that it could be challenging to realize the comprehensive evaluation of the research object in the early stage of drug research and development. Herein, we proposed an integrated method (GM-Pep) that contained a conditional variational autoencoder model (CVAE) and a positive sample training multiclassifier (Deep-Multiclassifier) to effectively generate a single bioactive peptide sequence without toxicity and referential side effects. The results showed that our Deep-Multiclassifier model gave a sequence accuracy of up to 96.41% [toxicity (94.48%), antifungal (96.58%), antihypertensive (97.18%), and antibacterial (96.91%), respectively]. The properties of Deep-Multiclassifier and CVAE were validated through 12 first synthesized antibacterial peptides or compared to random peptides.

Importance Although prescribers face numerous patient-centered challenges during transitions of care (TOC) at hospital discharge, prolonged duration of antimicrobial therapy for common infections remains problematic, and resources are needed for antimicrobial stewardship throughout this period. Objective To evaluate a pharmacist-driven intervention designed to improve selection and duration of oral antimicrobial therapy prescribed at hospital discharge for common infections. Design, Setting, and Participants This quality improvement study used a nonrandomized stepped-wedge design with 3 study phases from September 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019. Seventeen distinct medicine, surgery, and specialty units from a health system in Southeast Michigan participated, including 1 academic tertiary hospital and 4 community hospitals. Hospitalized adults who had urinary, respiratory, skin and/or soft tissue, and intra-abdominal infections and were prescribed antimicrobials at discharge were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from February 18, 2020, to February 28, 2022. Interventions Clinical pharmacists engaged in a new standard of care for antimicrobial stewardship practices during TOC by identifying patients to be discharged with a prescription for oral antimicrobials and collaborating with primary teams to prescribe optimal therapy. Academic and community hospitals used both antimicrobial stewardship and clinical pharmacists in a multidisciplinary rounding model to discuss, document, and facilitate order entry of the antimicrobial prescription at discharge. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was frequency of optimized antimicrobial prescription at discharge. Health system guidelines developed from national guidelines and best practices for short-course therapies were used to evaluate optimal therapy. Results A total of 800 patients prescribed oral antimicrobials at hospital discharge were included in the analysis (441 women [55.1%]; mean [SD] age, 66.8 [17.3] years): 400 in the preintervention period and 400 in the postintervention period. The most common diagnoses were pneumonia (264 [33.0%]), upper respiratory tract infection and/or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (214 [26.8%]), and urinary tract infection (203 [25.4%]). Patients in the postintervention group were more likely to have an optimal antimicrobial prescription (time-adjusted generalized estimating equation odds ratio, 5.63 [95% CI, 3.69-8.60]). The absolute increase in optimal prescribing in the postintervention group was consistent in both academic (37.4% [95% CI, 27.5%-46.7%]) and community (43.2% [95% CI, 32.4%-52.8%]) TOC models. There were no differences in clinical resolution or mortality. Fewer severe antimicrobial-related adverse effects (time-adjusted generalized estimating equation odds ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.88]) were identified in the postintervention (13 [3.2%]) compared with the preintervention (36 [9.0%]) groups. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this quality improvement study suggest that targeted antimicrobial stewardship interventions during TOC were associated with increased optimal, guideline-concordant antimicrobial prescriptions at discharge.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Infectious diseases,,,,Inpatient,
2111,35536578,"Use of Novel Strategies to Develop Guidelines for Management of Pyogenic Osteomyelitis in Adults: A WikiGuidelines Group Consensus Statement. Importance Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. Objective To construct a clinical guideline for pyogenic osteomyelitis management, with a new standard of evidence to resolve the gap between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence, through the use of a novel open access approach utilizing social media tools. Evidence Review This consensus statement and systematic review study used a novel approach from the WikiGuidelines Group, an open access collaborative research project, to construct clinical guidelines for pyogenic osteomyelitis. In June 2021 and February 2022, authors recruited via social media conducted multiple PubMed literature searches, including all years and languages, regarding osteomyelitis management; criteria for article quality and inclusion were specified in the group's charter. The GRADE system for evaluating evidence was not used based on previously published concerns regarding the potential dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. Instead, the charter required that clear recommendations be made only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were drafted to discuss pros and cons of care choices. Both clear recommendations and clinical reviews were planned with the intention to be regularly updated as new data become available. Findings Sixty-three participants with diverse expertise from 8 countries developed the group's charter and its first guideline on pyogenic osteomyelitis. These participants included both nonacademic and academic physicians and pharmacists specializing in general internal medicine or hospital medicine, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology. Of the 7 questions addressed in the guideline, 2 clear recommendations were offered for the use of oral antibiotic therapy and the duration of therapy. In addition, 5 clinical reviews were authored addressing diagnosis, approaches to osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer, timing for the administration of empirical therapy, specific antimicrobial options (including empirical regimens, use of antimicrobials targeting resistant pathogens, the role of bone penetration, and the use of rifampin as adjunctive therapy), and the role of biomarkers and imaging to assess responses to therapy. Conclusions and Relevance The WikiGuidelines approach offers a novel methodology for clinical guideline development that precludes recommendations based on low-quality data or opinion. The primary limitation is the need for more rigorous clinical investigations, enabling additional clear recommendations for clinical questions currently unresolved by high-quality data.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

2113,35536856,"Characteristics of antimicrobial stewardship programmes in hospitals of Uganda.  While interest in antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) is growing in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a paucity of information on their adoption or implementation in Africa, particularly Uganda. The study assessed the presence and characteristics of ASPs, implemented antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) strategies and the challenges to their implementation in hospitals in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study among heads of infection prevention committees (IPCs) in regional referral hospitals, general hospitals, and private-not-for-profit (PNFP) hospitals from November 2019 to February 2020. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. We analysed data using descriptive statistics. A total of 32 heads of IPCs were enrolled in the study. Of these, eight were from regional referral hospitals, 21 were from general hospitals, and three were from PNFPs. Most heads of IPC were pharmacists (17/32, 53.1%) with a mean age and standard deviation (sd) of 36.1 (±1.1) years. A formal ASP was adopted or implemented in 14 out of the 32 (44%, 95% CI 26-62) studied hospitals. Thirty out of 32 hospitals implemented at least one type of AMS strategy. Sixty-eight percent (22/32) of the hospitals implemented pre-authorisation and approval as their primary AMS core strategy to optimise antibacterial use. The most commonly reported challenges to the implementation of ASP across all 32 hospitals (with or without ASP) were lack of time for the ASP team (29/32, 90.6%) and lack of allocated funding for antimicrobial stewardship team (29/32, 90.6%). In this study, most hospitals in Uganda implemented at least one AMS strategy despite the low implementation of ASPs in hospitals.

With the integration of the affective domain in the pharmacy accreditation standards, it is important for programs to have methods for formatively assessing student competency in these areas. The objective of this study was to examine the validity evidence for a recently developed situational judgment test (SJT) to assess the affective domain contained in the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) Standards 2016.Methods. After pilot testing items in multiple pharmacy schools, a revised 15 item SJT instrument was developed measuring the affective domain as it relates to the pharmacy profession: the Pharmacy Affective Domain SJT (PAD-S). The PAD-S was administered to students at three institutions and internal structure validity evidence was examined using item descriptives, Cronbach's alpha, and results from a Rasch measurement model.Results. There were 559 valid responses included in the study. The items were of varying difficulty with Rasch results confirming the hierarchy of items and suggesting that items were contributing to the measure. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.70 suggesting acceptable reliability. However, the reliability items from the Rasch model were lower (0.65 and 0.66) indicating that the ranking of ability was limited, which may be due to fewer items of high difficulty.Conclusion. Overall, the PAD-S performed well as a measure of the affective domain.

Objective To describe the creation of a virtual training program (Generation Rx Ambassadors) and evaluate a pilot offering's impact on knowledge and perceived abilities in delivering Generation Rx medication safety outreach.Methods Generation Rx (GenRx) is a prevention education program used by student pharmacists to teach safe medication practices in the community. Generation Rx Ambassadors, an asynchronous virtual course, was developed to train facilitators toward best-practice GenRx delivery. The training was piloted in a mixed student cohort and evaluated using a pre-/post-program survey assessing participants' objective knowledge gains and self-perceived abilities to appropriately deliver GenRx education.Results. Fifty-two health sciences undergraduate, graduate, and professional pharmacy (PharmD) students completed the pilot offering of Ambassadors Regardless of degree status or discipline, participants demonstrated significant knowledge gains for all outcomes except defining medication misuse behaviors (for which there was initial strong mastery). Prior to Ambassadors training, many participants indicated a perceived ability to effectively deliver GenRx education; however, corresponding objective knowledge assessment did not support this belief. Training through the Ambassadors program appropriately aligned participants' perceived abilities with actual content knowledge for most program learning outcomes.Conclusion. These pilot findings suggest that Ambassadors is an effective training tool toward best-practice GenRx delivery. More generally, this work reiterates a need to formally train student pharmacists ahead of community outreach activities, particularly in the prevention education arena. Future evaluation will focus on replicating this study with an expanded cohort size and assessing Ambassadors' ability to deliver GenRx education in community-based settings.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2117,35537793,"Pharmacist interventions to improve hypertension management: protocol for a systematic review of randomised controlled trials. INTRODUCTION Hypertension management remains a major public health challenge in primary care. Innovative interventions to improve blood pressure (BP) control are needed. One approach is through community-based models of care with the involvement of pharmacists and other non-physician healthcare professionals. Our objective is to systematically review the evidence of the impact of pharmacist care alone or in collaboration with other healthcare professionals on BP among hypertensive outpatients compared with usual care. Because these interventions can be complex, with various components, the effect size may differ between the type of interventions. One major focus of our study will be to assess carefully the heterogeneity in the effects of these interventions to identify which ones work best in a given healthcare setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Systematic searches of the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica (Embase) and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases will be conducted. Randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of pharmacist interventions on BP among outpatients will be included. Examples for pharmacist interventions are patient education, feedback to physician and medication management. The outcome will be the change in BP or BP at follow-up or BP control. Results will be synthesised descriptively and, if appropriate, will be pooled across studies to perform meta-analyses. If feasible, we will also perform a network meta-analysis to compare interventions that have not been compared directly head-to-head by using indirect evidence. Heterogeneity in the effect will be evaluated through prespecified subgroup and stratified analyses, accounting notably for the type and intensity of interventions, patients' characteristics and healthcare setting.

2118,35537904,"The tension between national consistency and jurisdictional professional expansion: The case of pharmacist-administered vaccinations. BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of coordinating policies on vaccinations at the national level. In Australia, the regulation and management of pharmacist-administered vaccination programs are the responsibility of each of the eight jurisdictions (six states and two territories), and have been developed independently of each other, leading to substantial variation. Consequently, there are variations regarding which vaccines pharmacists can administer, the minimum age, and whether these vaccines are publicly funded. OBJECTIVE(S) To identify opportunities for a nationally consistent approach to pharmacist-administered vaccinations in Australia. METHODS This policy analysis used the Multiple Streams Framework to identify barriers and enablers within the three ""streams"" of problem, policy, and politics, and how they affected the development of a national approach. Data were drawn from semi-structured interviews with 13 key policy actors and documents (pre-budget submissions and parliamentary inquiry reports). Themes were generated around actor interests, current and proposed pharmacist vaccination programs, and policymaking processes. RESULTS From the pharmacy sector, there was little clarity around the need for a nationally consistent approach. This issue was linked to their ultimate goal of expanding pharmacist vaccination programs; it was seen as a means for states/territories with smaller programs to 'catch up' to other jurisdictions. There was also no unified policy approach from this sector; additionally, decision-makers within jurisdictional health departments faced different service delivery models, policy priorities, agendas, and policy actor relationships. Lastly, there was no federal body that had the capacity to coordinate a national approach. Possible enablers include refining the problem definition and re-framing it to a patient-centric model. CONCLUSIONS Coordination of vaccination policies is an ongoing policy issue with implications for pharmacist vaccination programs and other health policy areas in which a national approach is being considered. This analysis provides insight into how this may be developed in the future.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2119,35538396,"Reaching people receiving opioid agonist therapy at community pharmacies with hepatitis C virus: An international randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND Conventional healthcare models struggle to engage those at risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This international study evaluated point-of-care (PoC) HCV RNA diagnostic outreach and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment for individuals receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in community pharmacies. AIMS We assessed the effectiveness of a roving nurse-led pathway offering PoC HCV RNA testing to OAT clients in community pharmacies relative to conventional care. METHODS Pharmacies in Scotland, Wales, and Australia were randomised to provide PoC HCV RNA testing or conventional referral. Pharmacists directed OAT clients to on-site nurses (intervention) or local clinics (control). Infected participants were treated with DAAs, alongside OAT. Primary outcome was the number of participants with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR) and analysed using mixed effects logistic regression in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS Forty pharmacies were randomised. The ITT population contained 1410 OAT clients. In the conventional arm (n = 648), 62 (10%) agreed to testing, 17 (27%) were tested, 6 (35%) were positive and 5 (83%) initiated treatment. In the intervention arm (n = 762), 148 (19%) agreed to testing, 144 (97%) were tested, 23 (16%) were positive and 22 (96%) initiated treatment. SVR was obtained by 2 (40%; conventional) and 18 (82%; intervention). Intervention arm participants had higher odds of testing, OR 16.95 (7.07-40.64, p < 0.001); treatment, OR 4.29 (1.43-12.92, p = 0.010); and SVR, OR 8.64 (1.82-40.91, p = 0.007).

2120,35538500,"Impact of pharmacist services on economic, clinical, and humanistic outcome (ECHO) of South Asian patients: a systematic review. BACKGROUND Pharmacists in high-income countries routinely provide efficient pharmacy or pharmaceutical care services that are known to improve clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) of patients. However, pharmacy services in low- and middle-income countries, mainly South Asia, are still evolving and limited to providing traditional pharmacy services such as dispensing prescription medicines. This systematic review aims to assess and evaluate the impact of pharmacists' services on the ECHO of patients in South Asian countries. METHODS We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles published from inception to 20th September 2021. Original studies (only randomised controlled trials) conducted in South Asian countries (published only in the English language) and investigating the economic, clinical (therapeutic and medication safety), and humanistic impact (health-related quality of life) of pharmacists' services, from both hospital and community settings, were included. RESULTS The electronic search yielded 430 studies, of which 20 relevant ones were included in this review. Most studies were conducted in India (9/20), followed by Pakistan (6/20), Nepal (4/20) and Sri Lanka (1/20). One study showed a low risk of bias (RoB), 12 studies showed some concern, and seven studies showed a high RoB. Follow-up duration ranged from 2 to 36 months. Therapeutic outcomes such as HbA1c value and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) studied in fourteen studies were found to be reduced. Seventeen studies reported humanistic outcomes such as medication adherence, knowledge and health-related quality of life, which were found to be improved. One study reported safety and economic outcomes each. Most interventions delivered by the pharmacists were related to education and counselling of patients including disease monitoring, treatment optimisation, medication adherence, diet, nutrition, and lifestyle. CONCLUSION This systematic review suggests that pharmacists have essential roles in improving patients' ECHO in South Asian countries via patient education and counselling; however, further rigorous studies with appropriate study design with proper randomisation of intervention and control groups are anticipated.",1,1,1,1,,,Systematic review or meta-analysis,,,Other,,,,Other,
2121,35538566,"Beliefs and misperceptions about naloxone and overdose among U.S. laypersons: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND Overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) to laypersons are key approaches to reduce the incidence of opioid-involved overdoses. While some research has examined attitudes toward OEND, especially among pharmacists and first responders, our understanding of what laypersons believe about overdose and naloxone is surprisingly limited. Further, some scholars have expressed concerns about the prevalence of non-evidence-based beliefs about overdose and naloxone. We designed this study to analyze the prevalence, nature, and context of beliefs about naloxone and overdose among U.S. laypersons. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study (n = 702) using Prolific.co (representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, and race). Primary outcomes were the believability of six statements about overdose/naloxone on a seven-point Likert-type scale. Five statements were unsupported, and one was supported, by current scientific evidence. We used latent profile analysis to classify participants into belief groups, then used regression to study correlates of profile classification. RESULTS Believability of the statements (7: extremely believable) ranged from m = 5.57 (SD = 1.38) for a scientifically supported idea (trained bystanders can reverse overdose with naloxone), to m = 3.33 (SD = 1.83) for a statement claiming opioid users can get high on naloxone. Participants were classified into three latent belief profiles: Profile 1 (most aligned with current evidence; n = 246), Profile 2 (moderately aligned; n = 351), and Profile 3 (least aligned, n = 105). Compared to Profile 1, several covariates were associated with categorization into Profiles 2 and 3, including lower trust in science (RRR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.24-0.54; RRR = 0.21, 95%CI = 0.12-0.36, respectively), conservative political orientation (RRR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.23-1.63; 3:RRR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.35-1.95, respectively), and never being trained about naloxone (Profile 3: RRR = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.16-9.77). CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence suggests some U.S. laypersons simultaneously believe that bystander overdose prevention with naloxone can prevent overdose and one or more scientifically unsupported claims about naloxone/overdose. Categorization into clusters displaying such belief patterns was associated with low trust in science, conservative political orientation, and not having been trained about naloxone.

2122,35541501,"A suspected case of falsely low digoxin and vancomycin concentrations caused by free kappa light chains with PETINIA method.  Vancomycin and digoxin are associated with potential toxicity and serum concentrations need to be monitored in certain patients. Previous reports suggested IgM paraproteins could interfere with vancomycin assays, and no paraprotein interference has been reported with digoxin assays. Here we present a suspected case of free-kappa light chains-mediated falsely low digoxin and vancomycin concentrations with Abbott particle-enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) method. A 53-year-old patient received multiple doses of vancomycin and digoxin intravenously, but trough vancomycin and random digoxin concentrations repeatedly measured as <1.1 μg/mL and <0.2 ng/mL respectively with Abbott PETINIA method. Results from alternative methods showed concentrations reaching toxic levels and administration of the drugs was immediately terminated. A significantly elevated level of free-kappa light chains, possibly in polymeric form as suggested by protein electrophoresis result, was suspected to be the cause of falsely low results. During the laboratory investigation, absorbance curves revealed increased agglutination in the patient's samples in the latter part of the reaction, suggesting interfering substances led to production of turbidity after reagents were added.

2123,35541695,"Optimization of DOAC management services in a centralized anticoagulation clinic. Background In 2017, the Brigham and Women's Hospital Anticoagulation Management Service (BWH AMS) expanded services to patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We have since updated our DOAC management plan and adjusted the workflow of our clinic. Objectives This report describes how our DOAC management has evolved and describes key interventions made. Additionally, we report on the results of a survey completed by referring physicians that assessed perspectives regarding centralized DOAC management by BWH AMS pharmacists. Methods An analysis was completed of all patients referred to the BWH AMS and the number of interventions completed and documented in our anticoagulation management software. A survey with eight questions was sent to 110 referring physicians (selected based on referring to the AMS within the past 1.5 years). Results Over 4 years, 1622 patients on DOACs were referred to the BWH AMS, amounting to 3154 DOAC encounters. A total of 212 interventions for medication procurement, 171 dose adjustment interventions, and 603 coordinated procedure plans were completed. Of the 32 physicians who responded to the survey, many believed that the quality and safety of anticoagulation therapy was improved with BWH AMS management. Despite provider satisfaction with pharmacist-led care in DOACs, physicians expressed concerns regarding the lack of provider awareness of the clinic and possible duplicative efforts. Conclusion We plan to evolve the DOAC clinic model to optimize its clinical and operational value and to improve our delivery of care using electronic tools to move toward a population management approach for DOAC management.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2124,35544740,"National Survey on the Effect of Oncology Drug Shortages in Clinical Practice: A Hematology Oncology Pharmacy Association Survey. PURPOSE Drug shortages are a clear and growing challenge. Prominent shortages included oncology medications and supportive care products essential for the care of patients with cancer. Oncology drug shortages often result in disruptions in the timing of chemotherapy treatments, alterations in the dose or regimen administered, or even missed doses when alternative agents are unavailable. The purpose of this survey was to characterize the impact of oncology drug shortages across the United States, including the experiences of health care organizations, resource implications, and the impact on patient safety, patient care, and clinical trials. METHODS A 36-item online survey was distributed to membership of the Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association to gather information on shortages of oncology drugs (ie, all drugs essential in the care of patients with cancer, including supportive care agents). RESULTS Sixty-eight US organizations participated in the survey between December 2019 and July 2020. Sixty-three percent of institutions reported one or more drug shortages per month, with a 34% increase in 2019 from 2018. Treatment delays, reduced doses, or alternative regimens were reported by 75% of respondents. The most difficult agents to obtain were vincristine, vinblastine, intravenous immunoglobulin, leucovorin, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. CONCLUSION A survey of US oncology pharmacists indicated that oncology drug shortages occurred frequently in 2020. Shortages led to delays in chemotherapy and changes in treatment or omission, complicated clinical research, and increased risk of medication errors and adverse outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2125,35546411,"Systematic literature review of pharmacists in general practice in supporting the implementation of shared care agreements in primary care. BACKGROUND Rising demand for healthcare continues to impact all sectors of the health service. As a result of the growing ageing population and the burden of chronic disease, healthcare has become more complex, and the need for more efficient management of specialist medication across the healthcare interface is of paramount importance. With the rising number of pharmacists working in primary care in clinical roles, is this a role that pharmacists could support to ensure the successful execution of shared care agreement (SCA) in primary care for these patients? AIM OF THE REVIEW Systematic review to identify activities and assess the interventions provided by pharmacists in primary care on SCA provision and how it affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients. METHOD Primary studies in English which tested the intervention or obtained views of stakeholders related to pharmacist input to shared care agreement within primary care were included. The following electronic databases were systematically searched from the date of inception to November 2021: AMED®, CINAHL®, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), EMBASE®, EMCARE®, Google Scholar, HMIC®, MEDLINE®, PsycINFO®, Scopus and Web of Science®. Grey literature sources were also searched. The search was adapted according to the respective database-specific search tools. It was searched using a combination of Medical Subject Heading terms (MeSH), free-text search terms and Boolean operators. RESULTS A total of 5244 titles/abstracts were screened after duplicates were removed, and 64 full articles were assessed for eligibility. On examination of full text, no studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.

2126,35546465,"A preliminary study to evaluate the behavior of Indian population toward E-pharmacy.  The use of the Internet has increased exponentially for buying as well as selling of goods. Even the purchase of medications online is no exception. Owing to its benefits, there are certain risk factors in purchase of online medicines. Currently, the data on the use of Internet pharmacies are limited. Thus, the main objective of our study is to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of Indian population toward E-pharmacy in India carried out in the Department of Pharmacology, PGIMER, Chandigarh. A KAP questionnaire was prepared which was distributed to the participants through Google Forms and a URL sent to them. This questionnaire was divided into four sections including demographics, occupation, income, and use of the Internet to measure the alertness toward the online purchase of medicines. A total of 322 responses were collected, out of which only 268 (83.2%) participants were aware of online pharmacy. The awareness was more in males and that too in urban population. Among the respondents, majority of the users prefer to buy medicines offline (81%, n = 217) which can be due to poor quality of medicines and lack of trustworthy websites. The utmost reason for buying the medicine online was deficiency of availability in the market and differences in the prices. The most preferred drugs respondents were willing to buy online were prescription drugs followed by cosmetics and dietary supplements. In conclusion, of our results, most of the people use the Internet to search for the medications online who prefer to consult the physicians before buying. Therefore, the future of online pharmacy can be improved if there will be some set guidelines, awareness, and knowledge among the users.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2127,35546745,"An Overview of Clinically Imperative and Pharmacodynamically Significant Drug Interactions of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) Blockers. INTRODUCTION Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease resulting in premature death and disability. The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers including Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are used as first-line antihypertensive therapy to treat hypertensive patients with comorbidities, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. The use of RAS blockers is associated with the risks such as hyperkalemia, angioedema, etc. and the drugs potentiating them interact pharmacodynamically resulting in adverse consequences. This review article focuses on the clinically important drug interactions of RAAS blockers. MATERIALS AND METHODS The electronic databases such as Medline/PubMed Central/PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Directory of open access journals (DOAJ), Embase, and reference lists were searched to identify relevant articles. RESULTS The risk of hyperkalemia may be enhanced potentially in patients receiving a RAS blocker and a potassium sparing diuretic, potassium supplement, trimethoprim, adrenergic beta-blocker, antifungal agents, calcineurin inhibitor, pentamidine, heparins or a NSAID, concomitantly. The patients taking ACE inhibitors and mTOR inhibitor, DPP4 inhibitor, Alteplase or Sacubitril/valsartan concurrently, may be at heightened risk of developing angioedema. CONCLUSION Clinicians, pharmacists, and other health-care practitioners should be accountable for medication safety. To avoid adverse implications, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware of the drugs that interact with RAAS blockers.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the role of the clinical pharmacist in the rational use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in a general surgery department. All enrolled patients had attended the general surgery department of a tertiary hospital. This single-center prospective study compared differences in the overall rate of rational PPI use, proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization rate, average defined daily dose (DDD), drug costs, PPI costs, and cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacist intervention between the intervention (538 cases) and control (536 cases) groups. In the intervention group, Pareto and fishbone diagram analyses were combined with the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle; Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for analyzing all data. The overall rate of rational PPI use was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.01). The proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization rate, average DDD, drug costs, and PPI costs were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Cost-effectiveness analysis for the overall rate of rational PPI use indicated a positive impact of intervention, with economic benefits in the intervention group. Clinical pharmacist intervention for rational use of PPIs in general surgery departments could significantly increase the overall rate of rational PPI use; it could also reduce the proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization rates, average DDDs, drug costs, and PPIs costs. Pharmacist intervention also offers economic benefits by improving the overall rate of rational PPI use.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Inpatient,
2129,35549531,"How Remote Interventions Can Reduce the Impact of Disease-Related Malnutrition for Community Patients With Long-Term Conditions.  Nutrition is a critical part of health and development but over 3 million people in the UK are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition (93% living in the community). As part of a wider nutritional clinical review program across England, this specific pilot focused on proactive nutritional reviews within 1 rural practice, to explore how exacerbation of illness for patients with long-term conditions may be prevented and quality of life improved through the avoidance of malnutrition; identified through the timely delivery of holistic clinical assessments; and managed with nutritional interventions that patients actively engage with. These objectives were of particular significance in 2020 due to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in the delivery of healthcare. Within the pilot activity, a selection of patients at the practice were identified based on predetermined criteria. The intervention was delivered remotely by a clinical pharmacist. Two methods of communication with patients were explored during the pilot-initially communicating by letter, and latterly by telephone call. From a registered patient population of 6138, 59 of these patients were flagged to the practice for assessment as required and 102 patients were prioritized for remote assessment. Following a notes review, 60 patients were contacted via telephone with no action for 39 patients; 16 patients agreeing to a ""food-first"" approach; and 5 patients prescribed ONS. Results from the pilot and wider program activity demonstrate that patients willingly engaged in a proactive approach to remote assessments when using appropriate communication channels. It has also demonstrated that through guidelines adherence resulting in more appropriate prescribing, there are significant cost savings to be made through the implementation of remote nutritional assessments in primary care. Further research is required to address the system-wide benefit that these reviews and the identification of adults at risk of malnutrition could deliver.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2130,35549672,"Improving individualized prescription in patients with multimorbidity through medication review. BACKGROUND Older patients tend to have multimorbidity, represented by multiple chronic diseases or geriatric conditions, which leads to a growing number of prescribed medications. As a result, pharmacological prescription has become a major concern because of the increased difficulties to ensure appropriate prescription in older adults. The study's main objectives were to characterize a cohort of older adults with multimorbidity, carry out a medication review and compare the pharmacological data before and after the medication review globally and according to the frailty index. METHODS This was a quasi-experimental (uncontrolled pre-post) study with a cohort of patients ≥ 65 years old with multimorbidity. Data were collected from June 2019 to October 2020. Variables assessed included demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data, degree of frailty (Frail-VIG index), medication regimen complexity index, anticholinergic and or sedative burden index, and monthly drug expenditure. Finally, a medication review was carried out by an interdisciplinary team (primary care team and a consultant team with a geriatrician and a clinical pharmacist) by applying the Patient-Centered Prescription model to align the treatment with care goals. RESULTS Four hundred twenty-eight patients were recruited [66.6% women; mean age 85.5 (SD 7.67)]. The mean frail index was 0.39 (SD 0.13), corresponding with moderate frailty. Up to 90% of patients presented at least one inappropriate prescription, and the mean of inappropriate prescriptions per patient was 3.14 (SD 2.27). At the three-month follow-up [mortality of 17.7% (n = 76)], the mean chronic medications per patient decreased by 17.96%, varying from 8.13 (SD 3.87) to 6.67 (SD 3.72) (p < 0.001). The medication regimen complexity index decreased by 19.03%, from 31.0 (SD 16.2) to 25.1 (SD 15.1), and the drug burden index mean decreased by 8.40%, from 1.19 (SD 0.82) to 1.09 (SD 0.82) (p < 0.001). A decrease in polypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index, and drug burden index was more frequent among frail patients, especially those with severe frailty (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS An individualized medication review in frail older patients, applying the Patient-Centered Prescription model, decreases pharmacological parameters related to adverse drug effects, such as polypharmacy, therapeutical complexity, and anticholinergic and, or sedative burden. The benefits are for patients with frailty.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2131,35550329,"Males' Awareness of Female and Male Contraception Methods, Information, Outreach, and Acquisition Locations in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, Nairobi, Kenya, and Lagos, Nigeria. PURPOSE The aim of this study is to describe modern female and male method awareness, information sources, outreach exposures, and acquisition source awareness among young men aged 15-24 by sexual behavior status in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with unmarried, young men aged 15-24 recruited via respondent-driven sampling in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (n = 1,028), Nairobi, Kenya (n = 691), and Lagos, Nigeria (n = 706). Descriptive statistics characterized contraception awareness of male and female methods and information sources, outreach exposures, acquisition source awareness, and preferred contraception source. Multivariate regressions characterized factors associated with awareness of each method. RESULTS Majority of respondents were aged 15-20 (59%), sexually active (65%), and had secondary or more education (89%). Awareness was low for all methods (short-acting reversible contraception, 47%; emergency contraception, 35%; long-acting reversible contraception, 32%; withdrawal, 18%), except condoms (85%). Respondents reported low levels of contraception information sources, recent outreach exposures, and acquisition location awareness that varied by sexual behavior (higher among sexually active than nonsexually active respondents). Multivariate analyses demonstrated common factors associated across awareness of all methods included information sources (teacher, friend, Internet, social media for all respondents; pharmacist for sexually active respondents) and acquisition locations (private healthcare, pharmacy, market/store for all respondents; public healthcare, mobile clinic, faith-based organizations for sexually active respondents). Sexually active respondents' rank order for preferred contraception source was doctors/nurses followed by teachers, friends, mothers, and fathers; and for nonsexually active respondents' rank order was teachers followed by friends, mothers, doctors/nurses, and health centers.

2132,35550347,"Claims-based pharmacy markers for comprehensive medication management program case identification: Validation against concurrent and prospective healthcare costs and utilization. BACKGROUND Three claims-based pharmacy markers (complex, costly and risky medications) were developed to help automatically identify patients for comprehensive medication management. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between newly-developed markers and healthcare outcomes. METHODS This was a two-year retrospective cohort study using PharMetrics Plus patient-level administrative claims in 2014 and 2015. We included all claims from 1,541,873 individuals with: (1) 24-month medical and pharmacy enrollment in 2014 and 2015, (2) aged between 18 and 63 in 2014, and (3) known gender. Independent/control variables came from 2014 while outcomes came from 2014 (concurrent analysis) and 2015 (prospective analysis). Three pharmacy markers, separately or together, were added to four base models to predict concurrent and prospective healthcare costs (total, medical, and pharmacy) and utilization (having any hospitalization, having any emergency department visit, and having any readmission). We applied linear regression for costs while logistic regression for utilization. Measures of model performances and coefficients were derived from a 5-fold cross-validation repeated 20 times. RESULTS Individuals with 1+ complex, risky or costly medication markers had higher comorbidity, healthcare costs and utilization than their counterparts. Nine binary risky category markers performed the best among the three types of risky medication markers; the Medication Complexity Score and three-level complex category both outperformed a simpler complex medication indicator. Adding three novel pharmacy markers separately or together into the base models provided the greatest improvement in explaining pharmacy costs, compared with medical (non-medication) costs. These pharmacy markers also added value in explaining healthcare utilization among the simple base models. CONCLUSIONS Three claims-based pharmacy indicators had positive associations with healthcare outcomes and added value in predicting them. This initial study suggested that these novel markers can be used by pharmacy case management programs to help identify potential high-risk patients most likely to benefit from clinical pharmacist review and other interventions.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2133,35550348,"Implementing the pharmacy technician role in existing pharmacy settings: Stakeholders views of barriers and facilitators. BACKGROUND The field of pharmacy will benefit from pharmacy technicians, a higher educated mid-level support workforce. They support pharmacists in providing pharmaceutical patient care through delegated roles and responsibilities. Empirical research on pharmacy technicians within pharmacy practice community and hospital pharmacy practices tends to focus on the practical outcomes of this workforce addition. It mostly addresses the 'WHAT' of service delivered by pharmacy technicians. Literature on the 'HOW' of their role development in practice is scarce. Furthermore, it seems difficult for most pharmacy technicians to effectively fulfil this professional role. OBJECTIVE This qualitative study explored factors influencing role development of pharmacy technicians in community and hospital pharmacies. METHODS On site, individual and small-group interviews were conducted with pharmacy technicians (n = 10), and two colleagues: pharmacists (n = 7) and pharmacy assistants (n = 6). Interviews were based on a semi-structured interview guide. Participants were asked to describe specific incidents and organisational, relational and pharmaceutical care perspectives, illustrative of the process of developing and implementing the pharmacy technician role. Template analysis was used to develop a list of codes representing themes identified in the data. RESULTS Five interrelated themes influenced development and implementation of the pharmacy technician role. Two of them were at a more contextual level: (a) experiencing a lack of vision on added value of the new role within the field of pharmacy and (b) learning climate. The other three were related to personal interactions between staff members: (c) role expectations and organisational fit, (d) personal traits of pharmacy technicians and (e) support of pharmacy technicians through task delegation and role enhancement. CONCLUSIONS The data showed that development and implementation of pharmacy technician roles is a complicated process. A detailed plan for addressing and remediating the five identified themes is important to promote role development of pharmacy technicians.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To assess men's preferences for type of healthcare provider from whom they would obtain hormonal male contraceptive (HMC) methods. STUDY DESIGN We asked participants from three clinical trials of investigational hormonal male contraceptive methods-an oral pill (11β-Methyl-19-nortestosterone-17β-dodecylcarbonate, 11β -MNTDC), an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (Dimethandrolone undecanoate, DMAU), and a transdermal gel (Nestorone® and testosterone, NES/T)-to rank their top three preferred HMC providers from a list including: men's health doctor (urologist/andrologist), hormonal doctor (endocrinologist), reproductive health doctor (OB/GYN), family planning clinician (community health worker, midwife, nurse practitioner), regular doctor (family medicine/internal medicine), and community pharmacist. We examined men's preferences based on their rankings and conducted bivariate analyses. Collapsing the various specialists (men's health doctor, hormonal doctor, reproductive health doctor, and family planning clinician) into a single provider type, we examined participant demographics against provider preference (regular doctor, pharmacist, or specialist). RESULTS Participants across the three trials (n=124) ranked their regular doctor (44%) and community pharmacist (18%) as their most preferred HMC provider; these preferences did not differ significantly by trial and drug formulation. Specialists in family planning (13%), men's health (12%), reproductive health (10%), and hormones (4%) were least frequently ranked as their preferred provider. Older and higher educated participants more often preferred specialists over regular doctors and pharmacists (p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Despite receiving contraceptive steroid hormones and care from specialists in endocrinology and family planning in a clinical trial setting, participants in hormonal male contraceptive trials would prefer to obtain contraception from their regular doctor. IMPLICATIONS As most men expect to obtain hormonal male contraceptives from their regular doctor when commercially available, primary care physicians should become familiar with hormonal male contraception and be prepared to provide counseling and options accordingly.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND Hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes and can have considerable clinical impact on mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. Certain patient populations with diabetes are at an increased risk of experiencing hypoglycemia, posing as a safety concern and may have possible negative affect(s) on diabetes if not appropriately managed. With community pharmacies often being an accessible means of health care, there is potential for widespread diabetes education in this setting. OBJECTIVES Assess impact of pharmacist-initiated education on proper recognition/management of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Secondary objectives aim to optimize diabetes care: (1) assessment of patient need for a glucagon kit prescription, (2) evaluation of adherence to highly recommended vaccinations for individuals with diabetes and acceptance of pharmacist vaccination recommendations, and (3) assessment of patient satisfaction with the study intervention. SETTING AND PRACTICE DESCRIPTION A community pharmacy in the Suffolk County of Massachusetts serving middle- to lower-class and medically underserved patients. Most of the population includes an elderly, Hispanic, and Asian demographic. EVALUATION Outcomes evaluated through change in hypoglycemia questionnaire scores from preintervention to postintervention, the percentage of patients who received a prescription for glucagon kit post pharmacist intervention, the percentage of patients that received a vaccination because of pharmacist intervention, and Likert scale-based survey for the assessment of patient satisfaction. RESULTS Participant knowledge of hypoglycemia awareness/treatment improved significantly post pharmacist intervention (P < 0.001). Average gain in questionnaire scores from pre-edcation to posteducation was 6.4 points (maximum score = 9, P < 0.001). Glucagon prescriptions were facilitated/dispensed for 28.5% of eligible participants. Fifty-eight vaccinations were recommended, and 25.8% were administered.

2137,35550731,"Community pharmacists' experience relying on select implementation strategies in the delivery of comprehensive medication management. OBJECTIVE Implementation strategies are methods or techniques that facilitate adoption, implementation, and sustainability of a clinical program or practice. There has been a lack of widespread adoption of comprehensive medication management (CMM) in community pharmacies. The objective of this evaluation was to expand understanding of how select implementation strategies impacted pharmacists' experience implementing and delivering CMM in the community pharmacy setting. METHODS A community pharmacy CMM initiative, Slice of Partners in Excellence (PIE), employed a number of implementation strategies and key elements from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series to support increased engagement and delivery of CMM within a local payer's CMM program. The program provides incentives to pharmacies for providing CMM to select patients and achieving predetermined quality metrics. To evaluate pharmacists' experience with the implementation strategies and the impact it had on implementing and delivering CMM, a focus group and survey were conducted. RESULTS Some of the implementation strategies were more frequently highlighted as generating value to participants (coaching, community-wide problem-solving) than others (monthly webinars). Pharmacists identified a need for more formal education regarding billing, documentation and patient engagement supports. Pharmacists expressed a desire for ongoing implementation supports extending beyond this initaitive.

Community pharmacists', as part of the primary care team, optimise care for people living with mental illness. This study aims to examine the factors that support or hinder the delivery of mental health services delivered in Australian community pharmacies and proposes ideas for improvement. A qualitative study was conducted comprising focus groups with community pharmacists and pharmacy staff across metropolitan, regional, and rural areas of New South Wales, Australia. Data were collected in eight focus groups between December 2020 and June 2021. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Thirty-three community pharmacists and pharmacy staff participated in an initial round of focus groups. Eleven community pharmacists and pharmacy staff participated in a second round of focus groups. Twenty-four factors that enable or hinder the delivery of mental health services in community pharmacy were identified. Participant's perception of a lack of recognition and integration of community pharmacy within primary care were identified as major barriers, in addition to consumers' stigma and lack of awareness regarding service offering. Suggestions for improvement to mental health care delivery in community pharmacy included standardised practice through the use of protocols, remuneration and public awareness. A framework detailing the factors moderating pharmacists, pharmacy staff and consumers' empowerment in mental health care delivery in community pharmacy is proposed. This study has highlighted that policy and funding support for mental health services is needed that complement and expand integrated models, promote access to services led by or are conducted in collaboration with pharmacists and recognise the professional contribution and competencies of community pharmacists in mental health care.

BACKGROUND Documenting an indication when prescribing antimicrobials is considered best practice; however, a better understanding of the evidence is needed to support broader implementation of this practice. OBJECTIVES We performed a scoping review to evaluate antimicrobial indication documentation as it pertains to its implementation, prevalence, accuracy and impact on clinical and utilisation outcomes in all patient populations. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Published and unpublished literature evaluating the documentation of an indication for antimicrobial prescribing. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE A search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts in addition to a review of the grey literature. CHARTING AND ANALYSIS Screening and extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. Studies were categorised inductively and results were presented descriptively. RESULTS We identified 123 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents for inclusion. Most studies took place in a hospital setting (109, 89%). The median prevalence of antimicrobial indication documentation was 75% (range 4%-100%). Studies evaluating the impact of indication documentation on prescribing and patient outcomes most commonly examined appropriateness and identified a benefit to prescribing or patient outcomes in 17 of 19 studies. Qualitative studies evaluating healthcare worker perspectives (n=10) noted the common barriers and facilitators to this practice. CONCLUSION There is growing interest in the importance of documenting an indication when prescribing antimicrobials. While antimicrobial indication documentation is not uniformly implemented, several studies have shown that multipronged approaches can be used to improve this practice. Emerging evidence demonstrates that antimicrobial indication documentation is associated with improved prescribing and patient outcomes both in community and hospital settings.

BACKGROUND Common cold is among the main reasons patients visit a medical facility. However, few studies have investigated whether prescriptions for common cold in Japan comply with domestic and international evidence. OBJECTIVE To determine whether prescriptions for common cold complied with domestic and international evidence. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 22, 2020, and January 16, 2021. Patients with cold symptoms who visited the two dispensing pharmacies and met the eligibility criteria were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The pharmacists at each store and a physician classified the patients into two groups: the potentially inappropriate prescribing group and the appropriate prescribing group. RESULTS Of the 150 selected patients, 14 were excluded and 136 were included in the analysis. Males accounted for 44.9% of the total study population, and the median patient age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR], 27-42). The prevalence rates of potentially inappropriate prescriptions and appropriate prescriptions were 89.0% and 11.0%, respectively and the median drug costs were 602.0 yen (IQR, 479.7-839.2) [$5.2 (IQR, 4.2-7.3)] and 406.7 yen (IQR, 194.5-537.2) [$3.5 (IQR, 1.7-4.7)], respectively. The most common potentially inappropriate prescriptions were the prescription of oral cephem antibacterial agents to patients who did not have symptoms of bacterial infections (50.4%) and β2 stimulants to those who did not have respiratory symptoms due to underlying disease or history (33.9%). CONCLUSIONS Approximately 90% of prescriptions for common cold symptoms in the area were potentially inappropriate.

The feasibility and impact of ideas were assessed by committee members and presented to pharmacy leadership who endorsed and supported all proposed initiatives prior to implementation. Pharmacist distress scores were measured using the Well-Being Index (WBI). RESULTS The WBI was completed by 49% of invited pharmacists (137 of 278) in November 2020 and 41% (116 of 283) in June 2021. There was a numerical improvement in mean (SD) WBI scores from 2.06 (2.47) in November 2020 to 1.52 (2.49) in June 2021 (P = 0.09). Pharmacy residents had significantly higher distress scores than nonresident pharmacists (P = 0.01). However, pharmacy resident scores improved by almost 50% between the 2 time points, from 4.43 (2.13) to 2.40 (2.42); P = 0.03. CONCLUSION The development of a system-wide pharmacy well-being program creates a structure to collect ideas from employees, implement well-being initiatives, measure burnout using a validated tool such as the WBI, and continue to build, evaluate, and adapt new interventions. Importantly, the program went beyond addressing individual needs and addressed institutional opportunities that impact well-being. This can serve as a model for other pharmacy departments looking to implement similar programs.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2143,35553130,"The tiny pharmacists within: How the microbiome impacts the treatment of human disease.  Although the importance of human genetic polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions in precision medicine is increasingly understood, the role of specific genotypic variants and products elaborated by our ""second genome"" (the microbiome) has been largely overlooked. In this presentation I will describe a microbiome-centric approach to pharmacology, working to elucidate the direct and indirect mechanisms through which the human microbiome shapes the efficacy and toxicity of small molecule and biologic therapies. For example, recent research in my laboratory has revealed a complex interplay between human drug transporters in the intestine and commonly used excipients prevalent in foods and many drug products. This interplay is mediated by gut microbes which metabolize excipients leading to unexpected effects on drug absorption. We are also working on the metabolism of drugs used to treat heart disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and Parkinson's Disease by human gut bacteria. Collectively, attendees will learn about exciting new research at the interface between pharmacology and the human microbiome.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2144,35553949,"Repurposing Immunopharmacology to Inculcate Pharmacist's Professional Identity Formation in a Doctor of Pharmacy Program.  Immunology and Immunopharmacology courses offer multiple opportunities to bridge didactic and theoretical exposition to ""hands-on"" practice and application. In the United States, the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) is the entry-level degree to practice as a pharmacist. In a majority of the four-year PharmD programs, Immunology is taught in the first two professional years, followed by pharmacotherapeutic applications in the third year, while students are on clinical rotations in the final year. Student readiness for clinical rotations and patient-centered care is critical though difficult to inculcate, especially from the perspective of their ability to integrate foundational science knowledge with practice. However, predictably, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has focused learners' attention on several foundational science-related aspects of Immunology and Immunopharmacology such as vaccine production techniques, immune cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2, the concepts of antigen presentation and processing, and the use of many immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we leveraged the topical relevancy of COVID-19 to engage pharmacy students in our third-year PharmD Immunology course to devise strategies for overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Using published review articles assigned as pre-reading assignments in our Team Based Learning pedagogy, we introduced 19 third-year student teams composed of 5-6 pharmacy students to complex social-behavioral barriers to vaccination. The specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy included were 1) lack of awareness of vaccines, 2) fear and mistrust of vaccines, 3) distrust of health care professionals, 4) misinformation specific to COVID-19 vaccines, 5) faith-based and personal reasons for vaccine hesitancy, 6) misinformation about COVID-19, and 7) historical reasons such as the Tuskegee experiment for the prevailing mistrust in African American communities. Next, using a design thinking approach, student teams were asked to formulate and present in class a potential solution to alleviate each of these vaccine hesitancy reasons in the setting of a community pharmacy. Following one week of preparation time after the initial posting of the review article, in two three-hour-long class sessions, student teams were divided into ""anti-vaxxers"" and ""pro-vaxxers"" and teams debated each of the vaccine hesitancy reasons using specific data and examples from the review articles, also examining the effect of the prevailing state and federal laws in the United States on vaccine outcomes. Student teams offered 1) patient education, 2) counseling, 3) partnership with local community leaders, 4) researching literature on vaccine side effects such as those related to autism or the anaphylaxis due to albumin in older influenza vaccines, and 5) sponsored awareness programs such as ""walk for COVID"" as novel mechanisms for overcoming barriers to vaccination. Student perception surveys indicated 90% of the students found the activity interesting, engaging, and challenging, while 93% found it an effective use of their time. 98% of students felt that the activity helped them appreciate their professional identity as future pharmacists while allowing them to apply foundational science knowledge to overcome problems encountered in real-life situations.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2145,35555922,"Decoding Medication Tradenames; an innovative Method for Top 200 medications in Didactic & Experiential Courses. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether decoding of top 200 medication tradenames can result in improving pharmacy students' performance in IPPE-didactic & experiential courses. For ex: Macrobid®; provides an elegant explanation of (MACRO) size crystal form of (Macrodantin) designed for slower absorption & less excretion, hence, used twice daily (BID). METHODS An educational intervention of decoded tradenames (explanation of techniques used in top 200 tradenames) was implemented using Quizlet & summary-tables before the summative final exam in a first-year didactic IPPE course. Aggregate de-identified students' scores were used for blinded-paired statistical-analyses. A Likert-scale-surveys was used for evaluating students' quality of learning experience after both the IPPE-didactic and experiential rotations courses. RESULTS In aggregate analyses from Fall 2019-2020; paired data analyses using Wilcoxon test showed a statistically significant increase in average students' performance from 70.6% +/- 18.9% in formative to 80.5% +/- 23.5% in summative assessments after the intervention in control questions involving tradenames without rational explanation (p-value<0.001). Whereas, in questions involving tradenames that have rational explanations, students' performance increased from an average of 58.0%+/-28.3% before the intervention, to 75.9%+/-22.2% afterwards, which represents a net significant difference of 8.1%+/-39.8% between question groups (p-value0.009) (n= 169 students). In addition, at least 80% of students reported that decoding tradenames can help them to retain key medications features & connect it to generic names during didactic course, hence, provide better medication recommendations, & make less potential medication errors during their experiential rotation (n=72/94 students). CONCLUSIONS Supplementing pharmacy curricula with the art & science of formulating medication tradenames can improve students' academic performance in didactic courses. Furthermore, it can also improve the resulting quality of healthcare services future pharmacists provide during their experiential education.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2146,35556187,"Retrospective analysis of outcomes of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) for necrotising otitis externa.  Necrotising otitis externa (NOE) is an uncommon but life-threatening infection that requires prolonged systemic antimicrobial therapy. This study aims to identify factors associated with treatment response and outcome in patients with NOE treated through outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with NOE treated over a 4-year period (January 2018-January 2022) at a tertiary referral hospital in Derbyshire, UK. We defined OPAT failure as unplanned readmission within 30 days of discontinuation of OPAT. Prolonged duration of therapy was defined as length of parenteral antimicrobial treatment of more than 8 weeks. A total of 46 cases of NOE were reviewed. OPAT failure and prolonged therapy were recorded in 9 (19.6%) and 23 (50.0%) episodes respectively. Facial nerve involvement (odds ratio [OR], 14.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.76-76.60; p = 0.002), dementia (OR, 7.65; 95% CI, 1.23-47.46; p = 0.029), Charlson comorbidity score (OR, 1.41 per unit increase; 95% CI, 1.00-2.00; p = 0.049) and peak CRP level (OR, 1.03 per unit increase; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06; p = 0.027) were associated with increased risk of treatment failure. Facial nerve involvement (OR, 16.30; 95% CI, 2.60-102.31; p = 0.003) and peak CRP level (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; p = 0.016) were also associated with an increased need for prolonged antimicrobial therapy. In addition, extent of disease (based on imaging findings) was linked to prolonged therapy (OR, 22.89; 95% CI, 3.62-144.76; p = 0.001). NOE could be effectively managed as outpatient via OPAT. However, vigorous antimicrobial treatment and close monitoring of patients with pre-existing comorbidities, facial nerve paralysis, extensive disease and markedly elevated inflammatory markers are essential to optimise clinical outcomes.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2147,35558342,"Development and Evaluation of a Pharmacist-Driven Vitamin D Protocol for a Cystic Fibrosis Clinic. OBJECTIVE Vitamin D deficiency is commonly found in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and can have a negative effect on patients who are not at target goal according to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Vitamin D Deficiency Clinical Care Guidelines. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a pharmacist-driven vitamin D protocol (PDVDP) in improving, achieving, and maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of patients in a pediatric CF clinic. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted for pediatric patients with CF from August 2018 to March 2020 to determine the percent of patients with improvement in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to target goal (≥ 30 ng/mL). Patients' 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at 6, 12, and 18 months after automatic enrollment into the PDVDP were compared to determine if improvement occurred, and to calculate relative percent increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for these patients. RESULTS The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of the patients at baseline before the protocol and 6, 12, and 18 months after enrollment in the protocol were 23.2, 33.3, 32.7, and 34.6 ng/mL, respectively. These results demonstrate mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at all follow-up time points were significantly greater than baseline (p < 0.001). At 6 months, 50% (n = 20) of pediatric patients reached the target 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS The PDVDP was effective in increasing the number of patients able to reach target 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Our PDVDP process may also be used at other CF clinics to improve vitamin D outcomes collaboratively with the interprofessional CF team.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,Other,,,,Ambulatory,
2148,35558350,"Implementation of a Pharmacist-Driven Vancomycin and Aminoglycoside Dosing Service in a Pediatric Hospital. OBJECTIVE Pharmacy-driven antibiotic dosing services have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adult patients. This study evaluated the effect of a pharmacist-driven antimicrobial dosing service on the percentage of therapeutic serum concentrations achieved following initial vancomycin or aminoglycoside dosing regimens. A secondary objective was to determine the effect of the dosing service on nephrotoxicity in pediatric patients. METHODS This single-center, retrospective study used data obtained from an electronic medical record to evaluate the utility of a pharmacist-driven vancomycin or aminoglycoside dosing protocol. Assessments of target, subtherapeutic, and supratherapeutic serum concentrations were evaluated. The occurrence of changes in serum creatinine and presentation of acute kidney injury (AKI) were also determined. RESULTS The incidence (n [%]) of a therapeutic initial serum concentration was not statistically significant between pre-protocol and post-protocol groups (21 [46.7%] vs 22 [48.9%], respectively; p = 0.834). The incidence of initial supratherapeutic concentrations (19 [42.2%] vs 7 [15.6%]; p = 0.005) and the average number of supratherapeutic concentrations per antibiotic course (0.76 vs 0.26; p = 0.01) were higher in the pre-protocol group compared with the post-protocol group. The incidence of AKI was significantly lower in the post-protocol group (2.2% vs 13.3%; p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a pharmacist-driven dosing service did not affect the likelihood of achieving an initial therapeutic concentration. However, it did reduce the likelihood of both supratherapeutic concentrations and AKI. Additional studies in pediatric patients are needed to affirm the use of pharmacist dosing services.",1,1,1,1,,,Study,,,"Infectious diseases, Maternal / pediatric / neonatal",,,,Inpatient,
2149,35558353,"Implementation of a Meds to Beds Medication Use Program and Parent Experience at the Time of Transition From a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to Home. OBJECTIVE This study aims to describe the overall experience of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parent at time of transition home related to discharge medication use, following implementation of a Meds to Beds program. METHODS A descriptive, qualitative study was used to explore parent experiences around medication use during transition home. Eleven parents whose infants required medications at the time of transition home from the NICU participated in a semi-structured telephone interview post-discharge. The data were coded and analyzed for themes. RESULTS Major themes nested within the key stages of medication use in preparation for transition home from the NICU were identified: in-hospital preparation (practice early and often, Meds to Beds, and relationship with clinical pharmacist), transition home (schedule and routine, strategies for medication administration) and post-discharge (refills and long-term medication management). Strategies based on parent experiences to improve the process and ameliorate anxiety are presented. CONCLUSIONS Parents expressed how effective the Meds to Beds program was on the transition home by increasing parental confidence and knowledge around medications and reducing stress around the acquisition of medications for home. They also reported comfort in having a relationship with the NICU clinical pharmacist, providing a tailored approach to coordinating care both in hospital and during the transition home. Regardless of implementation of a Meds to Beds program, great opportunities remain to refine the transition home. Implementing the suggested improvement strategies could provide significant positive effects with respect to patient care and parental stress during the transition home.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2150,35560901,"Mnemonics Improve Pharmacy Students' Knowledge Retention, Clinical Application, and Exam Performance in a PharmD Pharmacology Course. BACKGROUND Students in healthcare professions taking pharmacology courses often feel challenged with learning and remembering crucial facts about medications, i.e., knowledge acquisition and retention. In addition, applying pharmacological knowledge into clinical settings consumes significant amounts of the student's working memory (i.e., cognitive load). Mnemonics (memory aids) are used to reduce cognitive load and facilitate learning and knowledge retention among students. Our study assessed the impact of the mnemonics' use in a Pharmacology course offered to second-year pharmacy students on students' perceptions of knowledge acquisition, retention, and clinical application in correlation to their exam performance. METHODS Eighteen mnemonics were developed and used in a course covering endocrine and autonomic pharmacology topics. Students' perceptions of the impact of mnemonics' use on their knowledge acquisition, retention, clinical application, critical thinking, and confidence while answering questions on exams were collected using an anonymous survey in the fall semester of 2020. Further, students' perceptions were matched to their exam performance. RESULTS Survey responses from 56 students (85% response rate) indicated that 80.4% agreed that mnemonics' use facilitated knowledge acquisition by reducing anxiety while learning, and 98.2% of students indicated that the use of mnemonics improved knowledge retention and application. Mnemonics' use was also reported to improve critical thinking while answering exam questions (89.3% agreed) and increased confidence during test-taking (96.4% agreed). Interestingly, 64.7% of students using mnemonics answered the associated exam questions correctly compared to 35.3% of students (p<0.05) who did not use the mnemonic aids. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that mnemonics' use in pharmacology courses not only improved students' perception of knowledge acquisition, retention, application, and critical thinking but also improved their exam performance on specific questions that tested concepts taught with mnemonics. Future studies will assess students' knowledge retention and perceptions of mnemonics' use with exam performance in subsequent pharmacotherapy and pharmacy skills courses.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2151,35561252,"Intention to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in May 2021: a cross-sectional survey in the general French population.  In May 2021, while the immunization campaign was in progress, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants led us to assess attitudes toward participation in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial (VCT) in France. Between the 10th and the 23rd of May 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a representative sample of the French population aged 18 and over and a specific sample of the French population over 65. Among the 3,056 respondents, 28.0% (856) would consider participation in a COVID-19 VCT. Factors independently negatively associated with willingness to participate in a COVID-19 VCT were female gender with an adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 0.42 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.35-0.51, and mistrust in health actors (in their own physician and pharmacists, health ministry, government, scientists in medias, medias and pharmaceutical companies) with aOR 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) by one-point increase in mistrust in health actors score. Factors positively associated with willingness to participate in a COVID-19 VCT were COVID-19 vaccination or intention to get vaccinated with aOR 4.89 (95% CI 3.15-7.61), being a healthcare worker with aOR 2.051 (95% CI 1.51-2.80), being at risk for severe COVID-19 with aOR 1.39 (95% CI 1.14-1.69) and altruism as the main reason for getting vaccination with aOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.29-1.88). In May 2021, despite COVID 19 vaccine availability, 28% of the French population would agree to participate in a COVID-19 VCT. Mistrust in health actors contributes to a reduction in the intention to participate.

2152,35561289,"Financial Impact of Medically Integrated Pharmacy Interventions on Oral Oncolytic Prescriptions. PURPOSE As the utilization of oral cancer medications rises, it is vital that cancer centers track costs associated with these expensive medications. This research seeks to report the cost interventions associated with medically integrated pharmacies (MIPs) and mail-order pharmacies. METHODS Data collection occurred from October 2016 through May 2021. Volunteers input data from their oncology practice into NCODA's Cost Avoidance and Waste Tracker tool, an innovative easy-to use tool that allows practices to document any cost saving interventions or waste occurrences. RESULTS The Cost Avoidance and Waste Tracker tool was used by nearly 50 MIPs across the country. Specifically, 26 practices submitted cost avoidance data, and 37 practices tracked waste associated with oral oncolytic therapy. Among the 26 practices, 677 cost avoidance events led to a total cost avoidance of $7,057,053.73 US dollars (USD). The net cost avoidance for the MIP's was $6,510,971.28 USD compared with $546,082.45 USD for the external mail-order pharmacies. Among the 37 practices that reported waste, 768 events were reported, leading to a total drug waste of $11,275,642.16 USD. Of that, $8,935,612.15 USD was attributed waste from external mail-order pharmacies, whereas $2,429,592.01 USD worth of drug waste was reported from MIPs. CONCLUSION Medically integrated dispensing of oral oncolytic therapies allows for increased pharmacy oversight, leading to increased cost avoidance and reduced waste for patients and third-party payers. Although these data are difficult to compare because of the complexity of workflows at different dispensing sites, the real-world financial differences between medically integrated dispensing and mail-order pharmacies appear to be significant.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2153,35561484,"'Red Flags' and 'Red Tape': Telehealth and pharmacy-level barriers to buprenorphine in the United States. BACKGROUND Structural vulnerabilities for people who use drugs (PWUD) were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, federal lawmakers in the United States (U.S.) invoked an exemption to the 2008 Ryan Haight Act requiring in-person evaluation to prescribe buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), which allowed for the initiation and maintenance of buprenorphine via telehealth. Despite the potential for telehealth to address some of the geographic disparities in OUD treatment access, recent research has suggested that significant barriers to buprenorphine also exist at the pharmacy level. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively assess how efforts to increase access to buprenorphine via telehealth are implemented by prescribers and pharmacists and experienced by patients. METHODS Participant observation and semi-structured interviews focused on telehealth for OUD treatment and buprenorphine prescribing and dispensing were conducted with patients (n = 19), prescribers and clinic staff (n = 24), and pharmacists (n = 10) in Pennsylvania and California between May 2020 - May 2021. FINDINGS While participants stated that telehealth for OUD treatment was a welcome option, pharmacy-level barriers to buprenorphine persisted. Geographical distance from patient to provider or pharmacist continued to serve as ""red flags"" for pharmacists, leading to pharmacy-level ""red tape:"" gatekeeping measures including geographic restrictions, telephone prescription ""confirmations,"" prescription cancellations and refusals. Patients' unmet expectations of buprenorphine access in some cases led to unanticipated risks including a return to injection drug use. CONCLUSION Challenges to increasing buprenorphine access persist in the U.S. even in settings where telehealth is implemented, and telehealth may inadvertently produce new barriers for some patients. Despite national support for policies aimed at increasing access to treatment for substance use disorders rather than punishment, policy shifts from punishment to treatment have not permeated evenly across all geographic areas and populations. Perceived threats of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enforcement, and self-defensive institutional practices in pharmacies, reinforce ideologies of drug law enforcement, leading to poor patient outcomes including lack of buprenorphine access.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
2154,35562697,"Improving access to medicines by popularising generics: a study of 'India's People's Medicine' scheme in two districts of Maharashtra. BACKGROUND In spite of being the 'pharmacy of the world', access to essential medicines for a large majority of Indians is constrained by both physical and financial reasons. According to an estimate, medicines account for 69% of household out-of-pocket spending on health care. To make quality generic medicine affordable, India's People's Medicine Scheme (Jan Aushadhi) was launched in 2008 and then revamped and rebranded as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Ausadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) in 2015. The current study focuses on the availability, affordability and acceptability aspects of PMBJP essential medicines. METHODS We have used a mixed-methods approach, with the survey-based quantitative component supplemented by a qualitative component consisting of in-depth interviews (IDIs). The survey was conducted in 11 PMBJP pharmacies in Mumbai and Palghar. Data were gathered on the availability, stock-outs, price and affordability of 35 essential medicines and 2 consumables. RESULTS Apart from the limited coverage of essential medicines and the significant presence of Fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in the PMBJP medicine list, the availability of surveyed essential drugs was also found to be low (47%) in PMBJP outlets. Across Mumbai and Palghar districts, around 50% and 42% of medicines were found to be out of stock for the period of 3-6 months respectively. The cost of generic medicines of PMBJP outlets for treating various conditions range from 0.01 days' wages to 0.47 days' wages for the lowest paid unskilled worker in Maharashtra. CONCLUSIONS The study findings show that PMBJP's unbranded generics offer great opportunities for substantial cost savings. But, in order to fully realise the potential of this scheme, some policy actions are urgently required. First, the PMBJP drug list must include all essential drugs that feature in NLEM. Second, BPPI should procure only those drugs that pass the bioequivalence test. Third, compulsory de-branding of generics should be done in a phased manner. Fourth, PMBJP's medicine procurement and distribution policies must be reviewed to address the supply chain issues. Moreover, there is a need for major pharmaceutical policy reforms to promote generic medicines in a big way. Regulations to support mandatory generic prescribing and generic substitution by pharmacists are needed.",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,
